Not the best dim sum I've had, but also not the worst. We came here on a Sunday for lunch for four. Our bill came out to 56 dollars with tip....pricey lunch??? I think it's a bit pricey for Chinese food. Like many Chinese places, service isn't #1 priority, but we made it in and out in less than a hour. I know we will be back, we can't help but go back for more.",0.0,0.9943835735321044

The server promptly rolled out a steaming cart and we began ordering. There were a few other items that we wanted to order that weren't in the cart, but we were able to easily and quickly place a special order for them. Unfortunately one item came out cold, (radish cake) - I didn't mind flagging her down to ask her if she can warm it up for us, but it is kind of a turn off that it came to us cold.\n\nMy favorites:\n- Sui Mai was fluffy, tender, moist and very flavorful. Super addicting. \n- BBQ steamed buns (white bao) - lots of bbq pork filling and the white bao buns were soft and fluffy.\n- BBQ pork buns (glossy buns) - The filling was very minimal, but it tasted great. Also, the buns were soft and sweet. \n- Fried shrimp balls served with \nsweet mayo came out hot and crispy. They weren't the best, but I still enjoyed them. \n- Chicken feet had good flavor and they were meaty. \n\nThese were edible but not my favorite: \n- Har gow - the clear wrapper was too thick and chewy. The shrimp filling flavor was alright, but it's not my favorite version of har gow. \n- Rice noodles with shrimp - these were dried out and overcooked.\n- Radish cake - came out cold, mushy, and oily. Not served with crispy edges like I'm used to. \n\nOur overall dim sum meal was filling and satisfying. We would return, but only if we are craving dim sum on a random day after 3pm.

As you're walking through the desolate shopping center courtyard, you'll see rows of abandoned shopping carts, an empty water garden, a stack or two of broken wooden pallets, and a coin operated merry-go-round. We almost didn't make it.\n\nUpon entering Dragon Court, however, you'll find that it's ambiance is pretty similar to many dim sum restaurants. One thing that's a little weird is that as soon as you sit down, pretty much every available food cart will flock to you. I guess since I've never been on a particularly busy day, the servers seek out customers specifically rather than just circling the restaurant waiting for you to flag them down.\n\nI've been to the other Dim Sum restaurant, and dish versus dish, I felt like Dragon Court wins out. My favorite dim sum staples are all pretty much there, too. My trusty dining partner said he'd be a little intimidated to go it alone without me, but that's the beauty of dim sum: there's so little commitment. Because it's just a series of tiny dishes, if you hate it, move on.\n\nUltimately, Dragon Court satisfies my need for the occasional dim sum to break the monotony of Sunday brunches of eggs benedict and sweet and savory crepes (ooo actually those sound tasty at the moment...).",1.0,0.6428357362747192

It is a popular place for dim sum and has been around for years. Chang's was actually my first real dim sum experience, sure I've had the various dim sum items before but I never eaten in the \""dim sum\"" environment where an old little Asian lady goes around pushing her cart offering food served from steamer containers until Chang's.\n\nNothing I've had wowed me to point of shouting \""OH THIS IS THIS BEST THING EVER!\"" but majority of what I've had were delicious with some meh items. They have all of my favorites. You have to either like or dislike dim sum to eat at a dim sum place and I'm in the middle. I like eating dim sum items but don't like eating at time dim sum places. I'll eat or try almost everything they have to offer except the weird stuff. It's kind of hard to keep track of what you've eaten until the end because they'll come around fast with multiple carts and containers, they'll show you various items, and you just say that you want it or not. It's easy to get carried away. There will be containers on the table and you won't remember what they are, surprise.\n\nOverall I don't think it's the best \""dim sum\"" experience you can have in Vegas but I'll probably be back just for the food. It's spacious but can fill up, reasonably priced but can really add up if you want to eat a lot, clean but not so clean, it's old and does look like it needs work.

I'm not sure if it's because of my taste buds or perhaps with other dim sum places popping up, such as KJ Kitchen at Rio....things have changed at Chang's.\n\nQuality certainly has gone downhill.

It's still just like any other Chinese place where it's hard to find anyone to help you when you need it. \n\nMy family and I came here for lunch this past Sunday and I must say, it was very disappointing.

But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \""spotted\"" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.",0.0,0.9952078461647034

The sauce it was in was CONGEALED. Like a weird gravy. \n\nMa Tsang -- This sticky rice wrap was probably the best part of the dim sum. It seemed over-steamed though. When I unwrapped it, the rice just slid out, and it was overly moist. Usually when you unwrap one, you gotta scrape it off the leaf. The flavors were there at least. I had a bone in mine though. But other than that I could at least manage to enjoy it.\n\nChicken feet -- Overboiled skin and not very flavorful sauce. worst part is one of them still had the NAILS on.

There was quite a long wait on a Sunday afternoon, unless you were willing to sit in the smoking section (we weren't). When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person.

However, I did not like the service! When my friend and I first got here (around 1130), we had to wait about 10-15 min before we could get some tea or even water to drink! It wasn't even that busy yet, and we were seated right away! Usually, at many dim sum places, it is automatic to get tea or water right away! Also, the carts did not come to our side very often, so we had to make sure to get plenty of things before we started really eating! (Especially the dessert cart! Geez! That one took forever to come by!).\n\nThe place is also pretty small. We can barely get into or out of our seats, since they were so close together (so I just stayed in mine the whole time without moving it heheh!). \n\nThe only thing that I tried here that was not as common as other dim sum places was their soft tofu dessert with sugar/ginger syrup. It tasted like a Filipino dessert called Ta-ho (except Ta-ho is sweeter and not ginger-tasting). That was pretty good. They also had a seaweed salad, (which looked very good but didn't come until we were waiting for our check), and we couldn't try it! Other than those two, just your typical dim sum place with a limited quantity of items!\n\nI probably would not go back here, especially if I ever have to wait!

Be ready to FLAG those cart people! Expect a wait on the weekends starting around 12 (We went on a Sunday). \n\nBtw, the price for most of the dim sum is about $3 a piece, so it could add up if you want to try lots of things...(They also charge for tea!)",0.0,0.9976407289505004

We have dim sum at least once a month and have tried Great Wall, Golden Buddha, China King and C-Fu gourmet.  I believe that Phoenix Palace is the best of the bunch.\n\nHere is why:\n1.  Food quality:  Every dish was prepared perfectly.  Most were slightly above the other restaurants in term of taste.  There were exceptions (we like the shrimp stuffed eggplant best at C-Fu, and the chow mein better at Golden Buddha), but in general, this place was better.\n2.  Cleanliness:  Not that other places are not clean, but this place was spotless\n3.  Price:  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes.  We ordered more than usual here this morning to try some things (10 dishes total) and our bill was $25.78.  We usually average $33-$35 at the other places, and we brought quite a bit home\n4.  Selection:  I have seen that the selection has decreased at the other places as their clientele diminishes.  For instance at Golden Buddha, one of the original dim sum places in the valley, you would wait at least 30 minutes if you did not get there before 11am.  Now it seems that the place is barely full, regardless of when you arrive.  As a result, the selection seems to have gone down.  At Phoenix Palace, we simply could not order everything.  When we left, there were still many things that we had still not tried.  We also had a few things that we had never had before (very surprising since we have dim sum so often)\n5.

Skin was like rubber.  I make these and they use too much tapioca flour.  Also it was over cooked.  and there where shrimp shells.\n\nThe pork dumplings.  (shu Mai)  if it could be tough it was.  No flavor.  The colored roe they put on the top bled out on to the dumpling.\n\nIf I was very upset very disappointed you would think paying 7 dollars an order the quality would be outstanding.\n\nwould not recommend this for dim sum at all.",0.0,0.9995259046554564

Luckily, I remembered the dishes I enjoyed before (in NY and growing up in Hawaii) and I also got a heads-up text from Lily, so I knew exactly what to order.\n\nRoasted Pork: Crispy skin, flavorful duck meat with a tasty sauce to dip.\nCalamari: Batter was okay, but the spices were delicious. Squid could've been fresher.\nFried Shimp: Lightly fried whole shrimp with wonderful flavor. Again, just really great spices and it was cooked perfectly.\nBeef Rice Rolls: I know their shrimp counterparts are much more popular, but these were just as good. The sauce was necessary, but just a tad salty. I like the glutinous texture of the rice noodle/wrap.\nSpinach Ball: Haven't figured out exactly what these were, but they were giant \""shu mai\"" stuffed with spinach (or at least I think it was) and a type of meat. It was pretty good.\nTurnip Cake: One of my favorite dim sum dishes! Shredded radish, rice flour, steamed, and pan-fried. Same glutinous texture with a nice crunch. Yummy.\nBarbecue Pork: Good flavor. I liked the thick slices of pickled radish that is served under it.\nChar Siu Bao: Steamed barbecue pork bun. Yum! Soft and chewy bun filled with flavorful barbecue pork. Well done.\n\nWe enjoyed everything and although it wasn't very busy, the items off the carts were still fresh. They didn't have the turnip cakes when we got there and they were great to make it for us. Service was prompt and nice. We also enjoyed the tea service with our meal rather than our typical water. Great experience and convenient location!\n\nAdvice: Know what you want before you get there (whether you want Dim Sum or regular plates), since carts will swarm you immediately (and I mean, you haven't even settled in your seat or placed your purse down lol). Don't be afraid to ask what's on the cart or for items not on the cart.

A friend in town and I were wandering around the Palms while our guys played blackjack, and figured it was a good idea for a cheap afternoon snack, especially in a casino.  First, we were seated in the 24/7 cafe, and did not see dim sum on the menu.  We got up and found Cathay House, and moved in there.  The hostess never asked us what we wanted, and we had seen the dim sum menu on the flatscreen...silly misunderstanding on my part.\n\nOnce seated, we saw the small dim sum menu with the larger Chinese menu.  There were plenty of cheap items ($2.88 and $3.88) on the menu and we wanted like 2-4 to snack on.  However, when it was time to order, the waiter said after 3 the dim sum menu is limited to 3 or 4 items, all which had pork except for one.  This was not on the menu or any sign.  If it was listed that way on the flatscreen or on the menu, we probably would not have wasted our time.  So we ordered the one, shrimp dumpling listed at $2.88.  I was disappointed, and mentioned I don't eat pork, but he didn't offer an alternative.\n\nWe got the dumplings, 4 total, and they were fine.  We decided to get the bill because there were no other options, and of course we we charged $3.18 for it.  I decided not to argue because I imagine we would have been told that after 3, it goes up 30 cents or something.  But that is sketchy nonetheless.

I have been to Harbor Palace for dinner several times but it was my first time here for dim sum. \n\nI have to say, the dim sum was not good! It was very disappointing. I ordered siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, shrimp rice roll, glutinous rice wrapped with lotus leaf, pork bun, and this vegetarian dish. The soy sauce for the shrimp rice roll was really watered down for some reason so the rice roll tasted really bland. The chicken feet was alright but it was a little too oily for me. The siu mai and shrimp dumpling was alright too. You can't go wrong with ordering that at a dim sum place! The vegetarian dish was a little weird. They used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce and you can tell because the sauce was chunky. It was very unappetizing. \n\nThe decor of this place is kind of runned down and old. It definitely needs some renovation, especially because it was one of the restaurants in the main plaza of Las Vegas Chinatown. They should make an effort to build a better image for themselves and for the town. \n\nThe place was also understaffed. There was one lady taking care of 3 carts! I felt bad for her that she had to take care of all these tables and also manage her carts. \n\nThe tea that we ordered was also not that good quality because after the second refill of hot water, the tea became really bland and lost the taste and aroma of the tea! Usually tea leaves can last through couple of refills. \n\nI am still on the search for a good dim sum place in Vegas!",0.0,0.9997182488441468

You might think that this restaurant doesn't carry as much variety as other dim sum restaurants, but that is because this restaurant only has several carts circulating around the restaurant at any given time, so it looks like there is less choices.  However, they do not have the more traditional dim sum houses choices like preserved duck-egg congee and tofu/ginger.\n\nThe quality of dim sum is good. Thumbs up for taste & freshness. No difference in portion size, and dishes were not greasy. The chicken steamed buns were a bit dry & doughy, but all other choices were excellent.\n\nPrice is comparable to other dim sum restaurant. Our check for 4 was the same as other dim sum places.\n\nNo pushy dim sum cart lady coming by every minute disturbing your meal. The cart comes out maybe 2-3 times total in the whole meal. Only a few of the staff is Asian, which is OK because the non-Asian staff appeared to be knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive. This might be a good dim sum starter restaurant for those who want decent dim sum but don't want the hustle of Chinatown.\n\nThe decor is clean with some fish aquariums, but there is absolutely nothing Asian about it. You wouldn't know you're in an Asian restaurant and thought you were in a really clean Denny's. Perhaps restaurant management can put a couple of inexpensive Asian-like items (lanterns, bamboo, red color, etc) to be consistent with the restaurant's name.\n\nCrazy menu needs to be refined. What is with the hamburger and sandwiches? Not sure why they feel the need to stick American breakfast stuff and other items in the menu, and why customers will go to a dim sum restaurant to get American food.  This is very confusing and gives the impression that management does not know what they are doing.  \n\nTheir dim sum is good, it's also the name of the restaurant, so they should clean up the menu and stick to what they do well...dim sum!",0.0,0.7038679122924805

Every server that came to our table was friendly and accomodating\n\nTHE BAD:\n- The \""dim sum\"" plates have 2-3 pieces on them. One of the dim sum plates we ordered was basically a table spoon of cole slaw (aka noodles). The dim sum portions are NOT worth the $5 you're paying.\n- The BRAISED DAIKON, CRISPY TOFU, BABY BOK CHOI... dish. Imagine the size of one square of tofu cut into four pieces.

Also if you're hungry, you will not be able to share this (contrary to what the menu describes as \""For Sharing, small, and large\"").\n\n\nBasically we paid an arm and leg to eat nothing.

The smoked tofu & soba noodle salad was tangy and delicious - a perfect compliment to the pork belly bites, which were rich and buttery.  \n\nThen on to the salads.  The iceberg was described as \""inspired\"" by the ginger dressing salad you get at Japanese restaurants.  It was actually almost identical to that, which ended up seeming a little uninspired after the two very special dim sum treats.   My salad was the miso braised eggplant, which was delicious and flavorful, albeit a little small for $9.   \n\nFinally, we tried some small plates.  The confit chicken wings were great.  Tender and saucy, with a kick of spice from some red jalapenos.   The crispy pig face roulade, though, was a disappointment.  I'm not sure where the \""roulade\"" was actually - it was presented as an open faced sandwich with meat, etc. and a fried egg on top.  I was given a steak knife to cut it with, but it was insufficient to tackle the task.  In the end, I had very unevenly balanced bites and I worked really hard to keep it all on the plate as I was butchering it.  Way too much work for something that paled in comparison with everything else we ordered.  \n\nBottom line - stick to the dim sum.  Everything on that tray looked amazing!",0.0,0.8758806586265564

And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \""coming right out\"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.\n\nWe spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits.

Sure, I really thought they were the best dim sum experience in Vegas (compared to the other few we have), but they have been going downhill since that very first visit (and review).  \n\nFirst off, there aren't that many dishes offered anymore!  They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.  (They apparently are trying out this new egg souffle dish instead.)  I haven't seen the pickled pig's feet ever again as well.  Blah!\n\nService was pretty horrible too.  I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.  \n\nAnd it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.  You just never know.\n\nHowever, I have since requested that we go back and try the other dim sum places in Vegas again since PPP leaves me less than happy and not satisfied.  (The Big F claims that when he went without me, they had tons of stuff coming out!  Maybe I'm bad luck or something!)",0.0,0.9991264939308168

They serve all the dishes a chinese restaurant would serve but they're honey walnut prawns are especially good.\n\nAlthough theres other places I would go first for Dim Sum, Harbor Palace is a good alternative.

He made it sound exclusive since dim sum was open twice a year, I felt that the dim sum style food could have been better if they focused on that and left the buffet of sea food out. It was tasty but some that came out was cold. They didn't have the chili oil like most Chinese restaurants I go to in San Diego, that was ok though since the items we had were a tad salty. The non dim sum items are  great though, fresh raw oysters, crab legs, lobster, nigiri, I actually asked the guy behind the sushi bar if I could have pieces with out rice, he said they usually don't give it out like that but he made an exception for me, to bad those pieces were so thick. I wanted to ask for a piece of the octopus but felt like I was going to inconvenience him so I walked down the buffet line, there was a yummy octopus and cucumber salad, probably the best thing on the buffet. They had a surplus of fresh fruit, mandarin oranges, cherries, rambutan, I didn't feel like working for my food though. Desert bar was pretty cool, decent, but not great. I really wish they more focused on dim sum though.. Next to sushi, dim sum is my favorite. Maybe I'll go this weekend when I get home to San Diego..",0.0,0.5427948832511902

A dimsum restaurant in Montreal that's worth talking about? Get out of here! But we finally have an alternative for dimsum other than Kam Fung or Ruby Rouge; an alternative with a slight modern twist (read fancier and more expensive.\n\nAs we entered the restaurant, I was in awe! The setting is surprisingly beautiful: modern look, chair covers, fancy plates and huge windows (the fireworks will be partially visible in the summertime I believe). I am sure this restaurant will be a very popular spot for upcoming weddings.\n\nUnlike the other places, there are no old Chinese women who barely speak English pushing carts between tables. Instead, younger waitresses take down your order and bring them to you as they come right off the kitchen.\n\nThe food was in general very good. Some of the dishes had a modern twist to it. For example, they had a rice noodle roll stuffed with Kobe beef. Another dumpling had a touch of truffle oil.\n\nHowever, the service was seriously lacking. I'd even say it was horrendous! Spilled water (on my friend), spilled sauce (on my other friend's jacket), a batch of dumpling still raw, etc. The waitress just showed my friend the way to the bathroom to clean his jacket. The worst is that they took so long to bring some of our food that we gave up and asked for the bill even though there was still 1/4 of our order still to go. I think all of us left still a bit hungry but we didn't care at this point. We complained to management only to receive some meager apologies. \n\nFor any other restaurant, I'd suggest NOT to go based on the horrible service. However, I really want this restaurant to succeed. Yes it's a bit more expensive but I don't really mind: you pay for the fancier setting! The food is good enough that I'll go back for sure. I believe that le Cristal Chinois is a good addition to the Chinatown scene: a breath of fresh air! \n\nPS: Please note that we went there on New Year's Day. Not only was it a very busy day but they had been opened for only 2 weeks. So the service may have improved by then.",1.0,0.951549232006073
