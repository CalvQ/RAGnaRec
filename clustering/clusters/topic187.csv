I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret. \n\nThere were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago. \n\nThe amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly. \n\nI failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH.

The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the \""lean\"" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was \""okay\"" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.\n\nAfter our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's.",0.0,0.9981644749641418

I feel it's my duty, being a transplanted east coast Jew, to weigh in on Jew food here in the valley.\n\nFirst, the positives: the food was pretty good. They didn't put any of those annoying coatings on their fries and when I said \""extra lean\"" I got a corned beef sandwich w/o any fat. They also stocked one of my favorite sodas, a deli staple, called Doc Brown's diet black cherry. Yum!\n\nThat doesn't sound too bad. So why the 2.5 stars, you ask? Okay, the negatives: the negatives all center around price. I paid $10 for a SMALL sandwich and fries. Now, don't get me wrong, I got enough to eat. But that's not the way a Jewish deli works. Half a sandwich and a side should be enough to eat. It is at every other Jewish deli I've ever been to. That way you can share or save the rest for later. Plus, I asked for an extra pickle. How dare I?! Little did I know when I made the request that they were going to charge me $1 FOR A FREAKIN' PICKLE SPEAR!!! THAT'S LIKE AN EIGHTH OF A PICKLE!!! I couldn't believe it! Add to that the cost of my beloved Doc Brown's $2.49 and I'm quickly going broke. But wait, there's more. I dared to order pastry.\n\nNow, there are several reasons I ordered pastry and none of them are particularly startling. First off, I'm never in a Jewish deli so I couldn't let the opportunity pass. Secondly, I'm a real sucker for apricot pastry and they had two different kinds. Third, they had mandelbrot, which is prominently featured in my novel so I wanted to try theirs and see if it's any better than what I get from Simply Bread (it wasn't). Though I only had nibbles of each of the three small pieces, just to try them, I paid $3.30 for the privilege.\n\nWill I go back there again? Probably not. While the food was okay, I feel like I was mugged. Kinda leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One even good Jew food can't get rid of.",0.0,0.9954586029052734

I understand that on this side of the country it is simply impossible to make really good bread because of the water.  Chompies rye bread and bagels are actually the best I've tasted in Arizona.  What I can't forgive is the corned beef and pastrami.  They are both so chewy and fatty and I don't understand why, even if I order it lean it still comes out extremely fatty!  To be honest every time I've tried a sandwich from Chompies I've been disappointed.  \n\nWhen we go here my husband usually orders a cheeseburger, he loves Chompies cheeseburgers, their fries and coleslaw are also very good.  I usually get a chopped liver appetizer.  Their chopped liver is amazingly good; it reminds me of my childhood making chopped liver with my grandma in her kitchen!  My new love at Chompies is the brisket sliders, they are yummy!  Their brisket is really really good and it's a huge amount of food! I always take at least one home.   I'm going to try the western sliders next time we go, I'm sure they'll be as good as the original.\n\nI go to Chompies at least once or twice a month to pick up a ridiculous amount of smoked fish for my husband and me to eat over the weekend.  They have all the classic smoked fishes you'd expect at a Jewish Deli, my personal favorite is sable; yes it is worth $40 a pound :)  Their whitefish salad is also really good, it has large pieces of white fish in it and scallions.  They also have a lot of different flavors of cream cheese including my husband's favorite, olive pimento.  The bakery section takes me back to my childhood.

I stumbled across it one day in the back of a strip shopping center at Green Valley Parkway and Sunset in Henderson, and have returned there many times since.  Weiss in Henderson and the Bagel Cafe near Summerlin are my two favorite Jewish delis in the LV area.  Having lived in Manhattan (NYC) for so long where I had my choice of high quality delis, Weiss probably comes the closest in comparison to any found in NYC.  The food is prepared the way a traditional Jewish \""bubbie\"" would make it (lol).  Try the pancakes...they use a special cake flour from overseas that makes their pancakes flavorful and fluffy.  They're killer, and put ANY IHOP or Denny's to shame.  I introduced several of my friends to Weiss and they ALL go bonkers over the pancakes. Weiss makes a proper chicken soup, too.  If you order one, the tasty baseball-sized matzo ball is like a prize in the the middle of your big bowl to keep carving into.  I also like the chopped chicken liver pate.  Not too many people would order such a delicacy, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas--and I'm picky.  Lastly, the sandwiches are generously portioned and made the right way.  Simple, high-quality ingredients are used--none of that processed \""meat\"" you find at Subway or other sandwich shops.  The bread is freshly baked and cut on the premises.  At Weiss, the full menu is available all day long, so you can have those special pancakes for lunch or dinner if you want.

Who would think you could get authentic Jewish deli food not on the east coast.  Well this little gem tucked into a corner of a strip mall delivers delectable deli fare with care and motherly concern.  My waitress said I would enjoy my pastrami on rye and she was right.  I love it when the servers are confident and proud of their food.  The pastrami had the correct balance of spice and fat piled high.  The caraway seeded rye bread had that firm crust and soft interior that allows the pastrami fat to soak in elevating the taste factor and demanding that you always hold onto the sandwich once grasped.   The quantity and quality of the food justifies the slightly higher price.   Try this place if you want a solid Jewish deli experience here in Las Vegas.,1.0,0.9993487000465392

Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels.

You couldn't tell the difference between the  pastrami and corned beef, and the multiple boxes weren't labeled as to what was what.

(I was expecting there to be barely any and was pleasantly surprised with how much I got.) However, what I was served was probably the most dried-out corned beef I've ever been served. While it was lean and tasted OK, it was just dry-as-a-bone. Major fail. The rye bread was fresh enough, but nothing spectacular.\n\nMoving on to the matzoh ball soup--also a mixed bag that overall didn't work. For the price, it was a very generous serving: a huge matzoh ball in a soup that's full of noodles, chicken, carrots, and celery. The matzoh ball itself was nice and soft. However, the chicken in the soup was so salty it was inedible (and I like salty).

I watched each cut, nearly 200 lbs. worth, be unloaded out by fork, and be given the final pinch test for tenderness. Some were segregated to an insulated container to continue softening, some were ready for temporary sequestration before slicing. The meat then goes to the workspace of a very fat man with a messed up eye, whose sole job is to slice the meat, which he did with a rhythmic panache, his jaw swaying agape in a chewing motion, almost davening with each cut.

They both have a ton of ethnic atmosphere, and for the People, it feels great to connect with another part of the lost tribes.  Otherwise, the food itself is excellently prepared with an almost Biblical recipe, and is quite tasty.  Certainly worth a trip if you are in Montreal and enjoy fat sandwiches. \n\nOtherwise, most North American cities have at least one old Jewish Deli that can satisfy your craving for smoked beef on rye.  Schwartz's up in Montreal is on that short list of great pastrami houses (Maison de Pastrami). \n\nSooner of later, someone will put together a Yelp List of great P'rami joints and this one will be in the top 3.",1.0,0.9981337189674376

Meanwhile, we don't have the around the corner, long lines that Schwartz's has, possibly because the above locations are much larger. Even with the massive hype Schwartz's gets via TV, social media, etc, it's not overblown. The smoked meat (or corned beef as many of us call it) it that good. It belongs amongst the best in North America, almost as good as Katz in NYC and at par with Harold's in Jersey, Caplansky's in Toronto and way better than Dunn's. \n\nComing to Schwartz's isn't normally a quick stop. There always seems to be a crowd here. Patience is a must and if you are big into delis it's worth the wait, even though sometimes it's well over an hour. Think of it as an adventure and enjoy it. You'll be telling your friends and family about this experience at some point. And, unless you have a party of four don't expect your own table. They'll slap you at the same table with two others and there's nothing you can do about it. \n\nKeep in mind, this place doesn't have a dynamic menu. They focus on what they do well, smoked meat. And, if you come expecting that you'll be wowed during each bite. The tender, lean, juicy meat is unforgetabble.",1.0,0.9970284104347228

I was offered cole slaw or potato salad...and since I don't like potato salad, I had to get cole slaw, even though my sandwich already had cole slaw on it.

I had to make a snap decision or I could've read that novel all night. \nSeeing the famous original Jewish sliders (featured on Food Network's Man vs. Food so they MUST be good, right??) I made my decision. And they come with gravy, which should always be a win-win. \nI also ordered the matzo ball appetizer and tried the potato knish. Both were mostly flavorless, greasy, and tasted frozen. The matzo app was served with a ranch dipping sauce (WHY??!) and the potato knish was a small, lonely loaf of deep-fried sadness. The rest of the meal was even more disappointing. The sliders came out very quickly-- much too quickly to be freshly made. They came with a side of potato wedges, which tasted rather stale and definitely was frozen. The sliders were larger than expected, but the buns were heavily greased and required multiple napkins throughout the meal. The brown gravy served on the side as well as on the sliders was nothing to write home about either -- tasted like any other gravy, I guess if you like that powdered gravy mix taste. \nI'm not sure what kind of meat was on the sliders... Beef? I'm guessing so as its supposed to be a Jewish style/New York delicatessen.

Absent that, just about everyone should enjoy what Mozart Cafe has to offer.  \n\nFor a small storefront, the menu is extensive.  The Ciabatta bread used for the paninis is excellent, and the combination of flavors that Mozart Cafe achieves with no meat and little cheese is almost miraculous.

I would also say that it is a tad expensive -- kosher restaurants usually are, but that is because kosher meat is expensive, and the Mozart Cafe doesn't use any.  They also cannot open on Friday night or Saturday, so they have to make up for it by charging more.  Whatever the reason, a sandwich here will cost you about $10.\n\nThey also have an instore bakery with traditional Jewish cookies and breads.  I tried two varieties, both very good.

Additionally, he is giving you less meat (in this case a good thing) for your 11 bucks, does not offer fries as a free side anymore and his sides are very small now. The potato salad was decent and good pickles, but the star should be the meat and that fell flat. Jewish bar concept won't work in that uppity area. Hope he goes back to the real NY (even though he is not from NY) bagel shop concept.",0.0,0.999451458454132

Last time I was here I had a chorizo & cheese omelet, and it came w/home fries (I think I could have substituted them for fruit or cottage cheese, but I was on vacation) and a bialy (can substitute w/bagel, English muffin, or toast). This was a TON of food. The omelet & homes fries were a bit greasy, but hey, they were good. I do LOVE that Chompie's serves bialies! \n\nThe service here can be a bit slow, but nothing TOO much worth complaining about. At the end of the day Chompie's is a solid spot.",1.0,0.74048912525177

I can only assume that most have never eaten outstanding Jewish deli food, and, as often happens with reviews on Yelp, a lack of reference points leads to a misevaluation.\n\nPeople need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.\n\nFolks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like. \n\nGreenberg's is a 2-star deli at best, and, quite honestly, is just a fast food version of a Jewish deli. It kills me to know that people leave Greenberg's believing they've just eaten quality Jewish deli food. Oy vey!",0.0,0.9924503564834596

Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas: \n\nRefill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint... \n\ngive us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount .... \n\nWhen you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness. \n\nDo something about the fries...when the person next to you says , \""they taste okay when you put gravy on them\"" you know they are just meh... \nIf you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult. \n\nCheck on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses. \n\nChompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?",0.0,0.9312020540237428
