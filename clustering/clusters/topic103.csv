I ask about this and tell them I am getting upset by this and the acted as though they really didn't care.  I needed my money so she calls, verifys my employment and comes back tells me there will  be a 10 day hold on my check. Seriously???  They have been cashing my checks since day 1 with no problems.  I put up a fuss and she tells me she will cut it down to a 4 day hold.  What???  So she can just make her own rules???  I told her to forget it and deposit it in my shared account in Nebraska.  She got really rude with me and told me they would put a hold on it also.  I looked her in the eye and told her to do it and I assured her they would never put a hold on any deposit in my account.    She deposited the money and guess what??? The money was immediatly available.  I told her to close my account because I was so pissed off.  She then told me I would be charged $35 to close it!!!

Okay...so I made that very last one up...but this is essentially the way any conversation goes when they've wrongfully taken your money, and good luck getting it back. I finally just gave up. When I went to another branch to close my account, the banker asked why, I told her that in the 6 years I'd been banking with Compass, the customer service had consistently gotten worse.

I was told that whether it was a credit/debit or check, I would not be charged an overdraft fee and my request for payment would be denied flat out. I opened the account so that I could have all my utilities auto drafted from my account and was warned that if there wasn't enough money in my account the bill would not be paid and that would be embarrassing. But that has never been a problem so I said I didn't want overdraft. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago. My husband and I had gone out for drinks and when I went to pay with my card, the bartender told me my card was denied. So I pulled out my handy dandy NV One app and I see that my account had been overdrafted because of an outrageous charge from Cox cable. Odd, but I figure that since I didn't have overdraft it was probably a mistake and it would be sorted out. I normally keep enough money in my account to pay the bills for a couple months, but at the time I was in the middle of a bankruptcy so I only deposited one paycheck a month.\n\nThe outrageous charge from Cox cable was credited to my billing account. Long story short, someone else's modem was charged to my account. So I went to NV One to explain the situation to them and have the overdraft taken off and had the pleasure of dealing with Suzy Drinkwine. She informed me that since the bill was drafted monthly from my account that they would overdraft my account to make the payment. When I told her I had opted to not have overdraft, she just repeated herself. Yes the bill is drafted monthly, but it runs as a check or a credit/debit card would so how does that make it ok to charge me a $30 fee? She just kept repeating herself over very rudely. I would've closed the account right then, but since I was in the middle of the bankruptcy, my hands were tied.\n\nThe worst part of the situation is that a utility company that I allow to auto draft from my account screwed up big time and my bank did nothing to protect me.

A while ago, I came to this branch just to deposit a check. I don't know what it is with the Wells Fargo branches in Las Vegas, but there seems to be a serious lack of envelope-free ATMs here. I guess I was spoiled when living in Southern California. I rarely had to step into the bank because any check deposited through those envelope-free ATMs would post to your account the same day and the funds would be available immediately.\n\nAnyway, I'll be nice and not name the teller and personal banker that helped me that day. They were trying to get me to open another account with them. I had to stand there and listen to them explain how every customer should have 5-6 different accounts under their name because of security reasons, all those scams going on, etc., etc. Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to say and believe me, if I was a millionaire and had nothing better to do, I would love to put all that money in 10 different accounts. But it was a busy day for me, I had tons of stuff to do, and I really didn't have time to hang out at the bank. So I politely declined, thanked them for the information and told them that I would definitely keep that in mind. A few days later I noticed that they opened 2 new accounts under my name without my permission! WTF?! I called the branch and talked to the manager. She was actually very nice, apologized to me, got everything resolved and told me that she would have a talk with those two employees.  \n\nThat's scary knowing that they have shady employees here, so watch out!

This review has been a long time coming, but unfortunately, you won't care what I say until it happens to you. :)  Let's start with ATM's, you wanna use one?  Then you better use a PNC or an extra $2.50+ fee will be added on top of what ever the other ATM charges you.  That's right, lets say your in Tokyo (only 1 bank in the heart of Tokyo will accept your card anyway,  all others will fail ) and they say $5.00 fee (in Yen), well PNC will tag on their own $2.50+ just because they can.  What dicks you say? well let me also say another thing about international travel.  DON'T USE YOUR PNC CARD INTERNATIONALLY.  PNC uses Visa which they decided to set a 3% charge too.  So spend $100 PNC will take $3, ON EVERY PURCHASE.  My previous international travel bank Fidelity has since sold out, but before they only charged a 1% fee.  Before you laugh and giggle about pocket change then picture this.  International at that you can only pull out up to $200 from, sub-track 10% (3%+ ATM Fees) of that and realize that it goes directly into the pockets of your financial institution, of which your money is supposed to keep afloat while they rob you blind any which way they can.\n\nSheetz ATM surcharge free?

They caught it immediately and my new card is in the mail. I'm so glad the red flag went up so fast and my funds are in tact, my only wish is that they had notified me before hand (a call or email), it would have saved me a little embarrassment.

We've always had a joint account at another credit union that my husband joined through the medical profession, so we've always had a comparison and SSSCU has always trailed behind.  Regardless, I kept our joint SSSCU open and continued having a portion of my pay deposited there every month.  \n\nI have finally submitted the paperwork to human resources to end the deposits and will close my account at SSSCU after our next pay period to make sure the deposits have transferred to our other bank.  I should have closed our accounts there ten years ago!!!  \n\nThere were several deciding factors and I'm only listing a few of the most recent, but #4 was the final straw:\n\n1.  Several branches have closed, making it difficult to go in person.  \n2.  One teller was unable to answer basic questions regarding certificate accounts and rates.\n3.  There have been incorrect checking fees charged to our account in error on 3 occasions in the previous year.  The bank kindly reversed the charges each time, suggesting a computer error or oversight, but it still took time out of my day to contact them and get it sorted out.   \n4.  Some tellers are really pleasant, but those who are rude are horrible!  A teller (at a store location) was extremely rude when my husband went in to ask a question about college savings programs.  She told him that all of the information was on the website and wanted to know what questions he had about that information.  He said that he hadn't looked online and thought he'd just stop by to get information.

A very long time customer.\n\nI have also, for the most part been a happy customer - until recently.\n\nMy niece took a Chase money order that I gave her down to cash it at the this branch, the branch I purchased the money order from.  They would not cash it.  Though she had two pieces of ID and I even called and told them that she was my niece  - I was told in no uncertain terms that her state issued drivers license had a number that was not clear and therefore they would not cash it.\n\nShe went two blocks down and cashed the money order.

She was short, to the point and cared not whether I continued to bank with them or not.\n\nThat was two days ago. Today I called to verify that a cashiers check that I had purchased at Chase had indeed been cashed.  When I called the 800 number I was treated as I had become accustom to being treated by Chase.  The home office folks did all they could do but told me that I had to call the branch I actually got the cashiers check from, lucky me, the Peoria branch.\n\nAnd guess what, when I called they listened..then the person who answered the phone said \""You do know it's 4:45 and we close at 5:00... I am with a customer at the moment (they answer the phone while they are with a customer??) so she proceeds to say... I will have to take your name and number and someone will call you back.\n\nDo you know... she only asked for my first name and when I asked her to repeat  my number she said \""no I got it\"" and hung up.\n\nI do not know what is going on with this branch or chase as a whole but it is pretty disappointing as I have been one of those customers that frequently recommends them.

We found out recently that not only was overdraft protection activated on our account, the type of account we have would not even allow us to have over draft protection. We called the 24/7 number to see what was happening originally because it was past the business hours of our local branch and they again told us that our overdraft protection was there. When we confronted the branch manager (Bronson Manivong) where we opened the account he then told us that our account would not qualify for overdraft protection. I called the number back again to put in a complaint with them about how we have been lied to by the customer service number and the branch and they then told me that even if we would qualify for overdraft protection it is at Wells Fargo's discretion if they cover the charge or reject it. I have never been ran around in more circles, or lied to so much by a company in my life.

But this branch in particular has gone out of their way so many times to make things difficult.  \n\nToday I went in to deposit a check.  US Bank's policy is to hold all but $100 of your deposit (unless it's cash) for 3 days.  Knowing this, I always cash my check first, then deposit the cash.  It already makes no sense to me that they will allow me to take the cash, but if I put the check in, they have to hold it.  \""In case the check bounces\"", they tell me.  Well if you already gave me the cash, and the check bounces, aren't you in even worse shape?  I've got the cash, you've got a bad check.   I worked at a bank, and I understand the point of holding a deposit.  If the check comes back bad tomorrow, they will not be out one dime, because the funds are on lockdown in my account and they'll simply remove them.  But CASHING the check leaves them completely defenseless, so why would they agree to cash it if ?  But whatever.  It takes more time and makes them work more, but if this roundabout method works, then fine, I'll do it.\n\nToday though, I was told I was not allowed to cash the check and redeposit the cash.  \""The check could be bad\"".  Then why are you willing to give me the cash?  \""I'm sorry, I cannot cash this check and allow you to redeposit the cash\"".  Ok, can I deposit it and have all funds available immediately?  \""No, it will be on hold for 3 working days\"".  Can you just cash it?  \""Sure\"".  So she cashed it, and gave it all to me.  I can't stop scratching my head over this. \n\nI said, \""ok, I have this cash you just gave me.  I have this deposit slip in my hand.  Are you going to refuse to take this deposit of CASH MONEY?\""  \n\nYes, yes they did refuse.  I did some shopping, and came back again.  \""I'd like to make a deposit\"".  They would not take my cash, to put into my account.\n\nI realize this review is a bit of a personal bitchfest, but just in case you're looking to switch banks, or already use US Bank, don't ever, ever go to this branch.

So I closed it and went in search of a free checking account.\n\nI found one at RBC, and since my husband is a Canadian citizen and we plan on retiring in Canada some day, I was intrigued by the idea of starting a relationship with a bank that was affiliated with a large Canadian bank.  Like most things I do, I opened an account online.  That experience was not as simple as I thought it would be.  It ended up taking a couple of weeks as different documentation (drivers license and passport, business license) that was not listed on the initial form was needed and I would scan them and send them by e-mail and the person in Rocky Mount couldn't open the scan, and it all became fodder for a sitcom.  So, that was the minorly irritating part of the experience that made the rating 3 stars instead of 5.\n\nBut, after getting through that (which could have been avoided if I just opened the account at the branch), I got a call from my local branch relationship manager, Amanda Claudio-Diaz.  She invited me to come in to get my online banking set up.  I normally would be wary of such a call because I generally like to interact with bank's websites.  But she just sounded so NICE and so eager to serve me, that I felt compelled to go meet with her.  And when I met with her, I realized that she really is eager to serve.  Sure, banks like to get a lot of info about your assets so that they can try to sell you things.  But Amanda really seemed like she could help me and serve me better, so I willingly provided her with this information.  She was honest and forthright about areas where it wouldn't make sense for me to drop my current provider in favor of RBC, and was not at all pushy or salesy.  She just wanted to start building a relationship with me so that she could help me. \n\nSo, I'm embarking on my experience with RBC feeling kind of refreshed and eager - free checking and a really nice relationship manager who seems focused on my needs.  If it wasn't for the minorly irritating online account opening process, this bank would have earned 5 stars from me.  And I can't think of the last time I would have felt that way about any other bank.",0.0,0.9528887271881104

I initially selected them because they opened a branch near my home, and 7 days a week is a big draw.   Add to that little things like a free coin counting service and they are very appealing.   I have had two negative experiences with TCF.   The first occasion was when I had just moved into a new place and I went to a third party atm so that my roommate and I could put money together for a money order to pay the rent. That ATM malfunctioned and never gave me my money so I took my receipt and went into the bank to resolve the issue. For whatever reason the receipt had a different time stamping than what was in their system and they refused to correct it and I had to pay a late fee on my rent. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed off. Other than that, the only problem I have had with them was when I moved out of state. I recently moved to Washington and of course I kept my bank account with TCF while I was making the move so that I didn't have any issues while I was driving for 4 days. However, when I got here of course there were no local branches so I had to get a new account. When I attempted to close my TCF account, they refused to do so over the phone and informed for me that I had to send a notarized letter to them. I think this is complete b******* . My best recommendation to you would you be very careful how you deal with them they have great services but they are very local bank and if you run into any issues with them they're just going to make you wait. By the way, I was unable to use my debit card in the entire state of Oregon unless I use a pin code. That means, I was unable to use it at any gas station. Pain in the neck.  I should also mention that their customer service agents in Minnesota can be very difficult to understand and they are rather ignoramus.

We discovered the Az PTA works with Wells Fargo directly so our paperwork would be streamlined and easy to set up an account.\n\nWe were assigned someone to work with.  The Personal Banker's name was Sabrina Petit.  She was awesome.  Very professional and helpful throughout the entire process.  The first time that I went in, I neglected to make an appointment and was told that Bri had just gone on lunch.  The girl who I spoke with said, \""why don't I call her and see if she can come back, she just left a few minutes ago.\""  She called and sure enough Bri said that she could come back!  Really?!?  Great!  She walked me through everything that we needed to do, got the account all set up for the co-signers who needed to complete info, and got our account up and going.  They offered our PTSA no fee checking, which included FREE checks!  Amazing!  If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.  The bank was out of money bags the day that I set up the account.  Bri said that she would set one aside for me when they came in.  Sure enough, she called yesterday to tell me that the bags had arrived and that she set one aside for me.  \n\nBecause of the nature of our account (business) and having mulitple signers, we have had to go into the bank several times to finalize signer paperwork.  Bri is always pleasant, patient, and helpful.  I would recommend that people ask for Bri - she was great.  So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!  \n\nOh and hey, you can't beat the popcorn machine, water bottles, cookies and sometimes lollipops that are in the lobby!

I tend to stay loyal to a business as long as the customer service stays good but I've gotten tired of this giant bank's policies and I'm itching to go with something smaller like a local credit union. \nI started to notice ridiculously high fees for things that should not incur a fee to begin with. For instance, I get charged to put money INTO my savings account and then I get charged even more if I or they have to pull it back into my checking. They call this \""overdraft protection\"", but it's MY money coming from MY savings account not a line of credit.  Don't banks like for a person to put money into their savings account? \nWhile shopping around I have found that the credit unions tend to not do this or if they do charge, they charge a nominal fee for removing money from savings usually only if you do it more than so many times in a month.  NO ONE ELSE charges you to transfer money INTO your savings like Wells Fargo does!\nBottom line is, I have no problem with the customer service at this particular branch or any Wells Fargo branch I've used,  but I think Wellls Fargo charges fees for  things they shouldn't and too much at that.

So I came home attempted to log into my account but couldn't so I called on a Saturday \""closed\"". Called Monday and asked about my problems with logging on and was told that my account was locked because my account was temporarily closed because I didn't make my payment.\n\nOk, first I was never sent a statement. I was not at 30 days since first use of card. I couldn't access to make a payment. I couldn't reach anyone on a weekend to discuss payment options.\n\nNow this brings me to this current time as I am typing this...

Anyways another East Indian tells me that I can't access my account until I provide verification from my bank? I asked for what and he replied to open my account again. I said I don't understand I need to access my account to make payments, watch activity, etc. Again, you need to send verification from your bank that you made a payment. Again, I said \""huh\"", I just made an over the phone payment when that payment clears will my account unlock so I can access my account online? He said not until you mail in your verification from the bank. \n\nSo here is the good part, OK I want to close my account! He says it's already closed! I asked so do you mean to tell me I have no further action to close my account permanently? No, it's closed. I am waiting to speak to a supervisor 33 mins and still holding.  All in all this is one of those cards that will fee you to death and at any point that you use it they will not send statements, lock you out of your account and charge you a $9.95 fee for overt the phone payment. RUN, RUN, RUN as people say.\n\n Close your account and stop the bleeding. Ok, 36 mins in and the call was disconnected. \n\nI am going to talk to a supervisor and ensure the account is closed at my request and follow through in a couple of weeks. The rough part is I can't go online to ensure the account was closed, you can't trust the people you talk with......

Hooray for Credit Unions!\n\nCompared to other Credit Unions I've done business with, CMCU holds up pretty well.

Honestly, most CUs have this nailed - it's an essential part of the experience, obviously - so ya.\n\nThey're growing - there are now 6 locations in Charlotte. \n\nAnyone that lives, works, or goes to school in Charlotte can join - which means anyone in our fair city who wants to opt out of the big bank BS can jump on the CU bandwagon. Although this is a growing trend among CUs, many still serve specific populations (ie, state workers, telecommunications employees, etc) and their families, so it's rad that CLT has a Credit Union that will work with anyone in the area.\n\nBut - c'mon, you knew it was coming - CMCU's not perfect. Dings include:\n\nBroken or empty ATM's at peak hours (broken) and Sundays (empty). Only worth mentioning because of the frequency at which these things occur.\n\nOutdated technology at the ATMs (if you need to check balances, make transfers, and withdrawal money, you'll be sticking your card in and keying your code three times). Website's a tad slow and anti-intuitive. But, they do electronic statements, so that's helpful.\n\nATM withdrawals are limited to 4 per month before they start assigning fees. Yeah, that's pretty lame. Getting cash back from a store purchase won't cost you or count.\n\nConservative lending practices and membership approval goes with the territory at CUs, so expect a pretty thorough financial check-up before becoming part of the Union.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty comfy with CMCU and plan on continuing to be a customer.

They are starting their own credit card next month but I was told that if I want to switch to that one I will have to go through the entire new customer application process.

No way...that's not an option....I want my money now.\n\n3 - I can pay the $5 fee and cash it right away.\n\nWell, I had no choice....I had to pay the $5 Rip-Off Fee......screw this bank.\n\nWill I return?

I've been a member with them when they first started as Pittsburgh Teacher's Credit Union. It was a small, community-like credit union - and whenever you needed to stop in - they knew you by first name. Made you feel like family. \n\nAlong with the name change came other changes as well. Some of which I could overlook - since I had been a member for so long. Changes to their policies, such as the amount of money available after deposit. I could live with that - I've had accounts with the larger banks (PNC, Citizens) - so I was used to it. But what irritates me more than anything now is the way they don't care about the customer. I had one simple question for them - called at 10am on a Monday - the phone rang, rang, and rang some more. The recording said \""all representatives are currently assisting other people\"" (yeah, don't know about this) - it rang maybe two more times - and then went into a general voicemail box. Like, are you serious??? This is a credit union! They have my money - and I need to speak with someone! This didn't happen just once - I've called them on numerous occasions, attempted to get ahold of someone through member services, card services, loans, etc. Nothing! It always goes back to the voicemail. So the other day, I was fed up and left a very generic message for them to call me back. They called me back - 2 hours later. But my question is this - I have numerous accounts with  you all - and you can't answer your phones during business hours? How am I to conduct any business if I can't get ahold of you? I don't live in the Pittsburgh area anymore, so it's not like I can stop in to talk to a representative.\n\nSo on that note - I'm taking steps to close all my accounts with this credit union. Please believe that this is going downhill, quickly. I remember when membership was only open for those affiliated with teaching. But now I believe membership is open to almost anyone.

The tellers knew you by name, interest rates were the lowest (often lower than the advertised rate on their site), and they generally seemed to care about you as a customer.\n\nHow things have changed, despite my ten years of banking, Riverset chose to not refund an overdraft fee and lose us as a customer. Their awful online banking website did not stop an automatic transfer (despite us trying to stop it for three months) causing the overdraft. When we called to ask why the transfer did not cancel, we were told that they saw our attempt to cancel it within the system but still would not refund the fee.\n\nSince this, i have convinced a few friends to close their accounts and switch to a bank that cares.

She immediately electronically refunded the money to my account. I did not pay any attention to my balance thinking that the refund would went back in to my account immediately. This morning 3/19 I received an alert telling me that my fund is below my set limit. I immediately logged into my account ; I found the charge and did not see the credit. I called Boca customer service she told me it is their rule that the refund would not be credit back for 5 days. I complained that they took my fund immediately but yet 15 minutes after noticed the mistake the credit was made; I have to wait for 5 days it does not make sense. \""Well this is the rule. \""; she replied.

I've had to spend over two hours and numerous phone calls to figure out why I am being charged erroneous amounts on my credit card from DS Water, aka Sparkletts Water.  Upon updating my credit card in late June with their accounting department, they not only were charging my current account each month, but also my past closed credit card account.  They were tacking on insufficient funds fees and stating I owed them money when I was current the entire time.  Finally, after getting to a manager, she apologizes that they made a mistake and it will be fixed.  By this point, I was furious and simply asked that they cancel my account and pick up the cooler.....note, I have been a customer for over 7 years!!!  They blamed it on a system merging problem when they purchased O Premium Water but that doesn't make any timing sense.  While she did her best to save the account, I had just had it.  I had to explain the story three times and the first two times I was told I owed more money, but when I finally got to a supervisor, the story changed, apologies were made and reassurance that my account was current and that all the fees that were charged in error would be reversed.  Still, I can't continue to patronize a company that blames the consumer first and then researches the problem to find it was their fault.  So, that was last week, they picked up the cooler the next day, took all the empty and unused bottles, and that should have been the end of the story.  RIGHT?!?!  Wrong.  Today, again, another charge on my account, are you kidding me?!!?  Another 25 minutes on hold to be told yet again, it will be immediately resolved.  I RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THESE FOLKS OR IF YOU DO EMBARK ON THEIR SERVICES, DO NOT SET UP AUTO PAYMENT WITH THEM.  I don't want to cancel my credit card because one business entity can't get it right, but if it happens again, that's what I will have to do.  Booooo!",0.0,0.999180257320404

I went in because I was having a problem with a  vendor charging my checking account and over drafting it.  Prior to this the only other time I have been charged a any fee was when they switched my account and the bank kept on billing me for a monthly fee in error which they reversed.\n\nA girl sat down with me and went over my account.  She was courteous but kept on trying to get me to sign up for things.  I told her I was good but she continued for several minutes until finally she asked what she could do for me.  Funny thing is when I sat down I told her exactly why I was there.  I repeated why I was there and she looked through my account again, the previous ten minutes she looked at my account I guess was just to try to sell me something.  I explained to her about the bank errors fees being waived.  After a long pause she said she had to talk with her manager about reversing the fee and she got up and left.  \n\nAnother 7-10 minutes later she comes back and says she couldn't waive the fee.  When I asked why? She said because they had already waived monthly fees.  AGAIN I explained to her that those were waived  because of a bank error.  I asked if I could speak to her manager but she said he was busy and couldn't talk with me.  \n\nAt the end of the day the fee didn't bug me as much as the TREATMENT.  They had me there for 20 freakin minutes and this guy couldn't come out of his little back door to talk to me for 2 seconds?  Also,  if you weren't going to waive it why not tell the person in the first few minutes, why drag it out for so long?\n\nIn the end I called the 800# and they waived it right away. If the people at this branch had bothered to read the notes on my account like the agent at the call center did they could have resolved it then and there.
