Because it's an awesome museum, that's why!\n\nBut in all seriousness, they throw the best parties, mostly because they have thee coolest space to do it in!  When you go to a party at the museum you're allowed to \""play\"" just like a kid would during regular business hours.  \n\nHave I gone down the twisted slide connected to the treehouse in a cocktail dress?  Yes I have!  Have I walked across the mini Pittsburgh bridge in the mini-Pittsburgh playroom?  Yes I have!  \n\nLike any good museum, they constantly have changing exhibits, so things I saw are probably not there anymore.  But the interactive exhibits are all about participation.

Reserve 2-3 hours to enjoy the museum. Plan ahead which exhibits you must attend and go there first. Suggestions:\n* Toddlers and young kids: KidsPlace room, Puppet Show Theater (shows at 11, 1:30, 2:30 and 3:45 PM), and Virtual Reality Room\n\n* School age kids: Digging for fossils (extra $2), Little Einstein science, and The Shop Machine exhibits. Here is a video with one of the live science experiments (blowing off a balloon):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/v/EYZlLbf80JI\n\n* Everybody goes nuts for the live Rats Basketball Game...however it's more of a hit and miss when exactly they have it open.\n\nThere are several PARKING options:\n* Use the museum garage parking ($7 day flat rate fee) and walk straight into the museum.\n\n* Park in the garage across the street from the museum ($5 day flat rate fee Fri and Sat)\n\n* Use the metered parking spots along the streets. Good luck finding one!\n\nFood is not that great, cafeteria style. Hamburgers, fried and grilled chicken sandwiches and small size pizzas. Also soups, yogurt, pudding and salad boxes. Combo options for about $6 include fries and soda drinks. I'll go with the pizza and the yogurt.",0.0,0.9979032278060912

Our kids are on the younger side (5 and 3) and can't read yet so some of the science things they didn't get or understand. The staff is very helpful and willing to help you with the experiments. We loved the little kid area where we could put our baby down so she could explore too! Cafeteria and parking is over priced but the cost of admission is totally worth it. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours wandering around. Great museum! We will be visiting again!,1.0,0.9996410608291626

For those of you who don't speak science, that's the human body and how it works. Love the Brain/Neuro exhibit, explaining how the brain works. One of the exhibits shows how the brain gets addicted to something. One of them was a test to see if you're predisposed (I'm a potential gambling addict). Keep me away from casinos!\n\n2) The Immersion Theatre, where you get rained at, shook, blown and stuck inside a toaster oven, all to simulate how nature bombards the Earth with its raw strength of the elements. You will get wet! Dont' say I didn't warn you! Plays every 15 mins so make sure you time your trip to this awesome exhibit!\n\n3) The exhibits on the topmost floor discussing energy conservation and how alternative forms of energy, and how it trumps the traditional petroleum sources of energy. Very very cool.\n\n4) A video within a \""cockpit\"" of a plane, explaining takeoff, flight and landing of a commercial airplane, with a real captain as a host! Very very cool!\n\nKid or no, this is an interesting place to go to. Nice place to learn stuff and have fun at the same time. I'm not a kid anymore, but I found this place entertaining. It was a lot better than those other places I've been to in my travels. Go go go!\n\nOnly complaint: Some of the exhibits are broken. Due to the interactive nature of a lot of the exhibits, plus the presence of kids, this is bound to happen. You'd think the museum people would fix them.

I grew up in San Diego and the girls spent the first 5 years in the SF bay Area. These cities know how to do a children's museum. In fact they have competing museums of awesome child centric wonder.  Of course they are also places you want to raise children, face it Vegas is not. \n\nThe one issue I have about children's museums is parents who go.  They allow their children to act like brainless monkeys who are merely pushing every button they can without regard to what is actually happening.  Sorry morons but you dont get Hamlet by chaining your monkeys to a typewriter. \n\nThis annoys me vastly because often the girls are pushed aside while they are attempting the scientific function of a display by some subnormal child who is looking to just spin the wheel.   If your child is going to act like an animal do us all a favor and leash them and bring them to the park. The rest of us would like to learn about the physics involved. \n\nThe Lied displays are also inaccurate esp the food pyramid one. I am sorry but who says you can intake as many FRIED eggs and glasses of Chocolate Milk as you want. While also claiming that trail mix is bad for you.  Was this exhibit paid for by the Dairy Board?\n\nBut with a vacuum of intelligent choices for children it is the best we have.  We should aim to do better.

I have been to a number of much bigger and better museums, but living in the adult playground of Las Vegas- I will take what I can get...\n\nI have been here 3 times now. After seeing my 3 year old daughter's excitement during the first visit, I knew we had to get a membership.  And with every visit, she is just as excited. We usually stay for a couple hours, exploring the exhibit of the month, role-playing in the bank, grocery store,  airport, and auto shop.  (She would spend hours in the grocery store pretending to shop and ringing up the items on the cash register if I let her.)  She also enjoys playing with the bubbles, and exploring the different musical sounds on the 2nd floor. She also loves to sing and the \""recording studio\"" is one of her favorites.  There are also arts and crafts appropriate for different age levels.  \n\nIt is a great way to escape the heat in the summer -and let the little ones learn and explore year round. \n\nQuick Tips:\n* Food and drinks aren't allowed in the actual museum, but there is an area of tables, chairs, and a vending machine by the entrance where you can take a snack break if needed.  (I never leave the house without snacks!)\n* It gets crowded on weekends and it can get a bit stressful with all of the older rowdy kids running around, but if you go on a weekday- it is a much calmer experience. \n* Note that there are a number of homeless people hanging around the parking lot by the library next door.",1.0,0.9954919219017028

It was a special sup rise to find the water table, explosive ball lunge, and other various blocks and magnet activities to occupy even the most active child. I have to admit we spent a large percent of our visit on this floor. \n\nThe third floor has an aquarium. This is where I thought the Center lacked, from an adult perspective. However, my son was thrilled he could pet a soft shelled crab, and use techno hands to \""grab\"" treasure in a sunken ship exhibit. \n\nSecond floor had the miniature railroad, also a crowd pleaser. \n\nThe main floor housed one of the main attractions for my preschooler, a trampoline where he was harnessed and jumped and flipped while attached to bungee cords. \n\nCarnegie Science Center has many more hands on exhibits and attractions than I've listed above, as these were my preschoolers favorites. \n\nThe Center is a welcome change from the many Children's museums we have visited. There is something for everyone here. \n\nTips- \n\nPlan at least 2 hours, more if you visit the Planetarium or Imax. \n\nDuring the school year there will be field trip visits, meaning large groups of many children. \n\nVisit www.astc.org if you are a member of any science museum or science center. There is a passport program and your visit may be free or discounted. This includes the parking and gift shops in many cases.",1.0,0.9945204854011536
