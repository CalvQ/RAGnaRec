I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!\n\nHowever, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better.",0.0,0.999525547027588

But it was no big deal, most of their stock is in Arizona so they can make changes quickly, I thought that was really cool.

I brought my son in for not one but two fittings.  I had to bring him in twice because he is growing like a weed and we needed to make sure the tux would fit. The first time seemed to be great. The sales guy was professional and suggested we have the tux delivered to the store closest to where the wedding was held for convenience sake. The second visit for measurements was quite different. The sales guy and girl seemed irritated with us and when the original jacket did not fit, they said they didn't have another one for him to try on but they would go ahead and order a size up anyway. They also didn't have the next size up in shoes. This is when I asked to change my request to have the tux picked up at the Matthews store for fear the tux was going to have measurement issues and they told me no. When we went to the MW in Edgewater NJ to pick up his tux we were told they didn't have it and it was sent to the Matthews NC store. We had to go back the following day after they FedExed the suit only to find out the jacket was two sizes to small and the pants were too long. We had to go back a third time (on the day of the wedding) and finally got a proper fitting suit. We were very inconvenienced and irritated with the whole process.

She was nice enough at first, but proceded to tell my wife to be that she thinks our colors are weird. Ok...forgivable....maybe she's senile or something. But then I hear from all my groomsmen that go in there that she refers to my wedding as \""the one with the weird colors\"". WTF woman?!

Do you WANT me to write a bad Yelp review??\n\nAnyhoo, after all that, some months go by, I calm down a little and it's time to pick up the tuxes.

So, they, of course, did try them on and lo and behold, they don't fit! So, she huffs and puffs and resizes them. Very rude.\n\nThe final straw: I'm elated. I finally meet the owner and he's a very cool guy and takes great care of me when I pick the tux up. Not the same story when I drop it off: I won't go into too much back story here because the review is already longer than I'd like to make it, but basically he ridicules and scolds me for something that wasn't my fault. I had an alternate groomsman that got sized but I told the owner's mother to not get a tux ready for him unless I tell them to. Well, they did get it ready and he told me, \""you should have given me a heads up! It costs us money ya know!\"" Wow...first of all, no it doesn't. You have everything there, remember? Secondly, it sounds like  miscommunication between you and your employees.\n\nHowever, even if there was some inkling of blame that rests upon me, THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! Retail: 101.
