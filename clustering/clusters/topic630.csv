In Chicago, good little dives like this are everywhere, but out in Phoenix, the few that try to delivery the same flavors of the windy city usually fall short. \n\nI can only speak for the Italian beef for now, but it was great! I walked up to the counter, and without hesitation, said, \""Beef, dry, with extra giardiniera and au jus on the side.\"" Needless to say, the guy behind the counter and I had a moment; he understood me and didn't need to follow up with any questions. When the food came out (it took a little longer than expected, but the cook kindly apologized fot the wait) my taste buds got excited. It was loaded with giardiniera! I've found that a lot of places are stingy with that delicious condiment, but not here. I asked for extra, and by golly, I got extra. One unique thing about the giardiniera was that it seemed fresh, like really fresh, and there were jalapenos in it! Yes! This little touch took that beef over the top. I put that sammich down and didn't leave a trace.\n\nLuke's has won me over for when I'm craving some delicious guilt-full Chicago staples. It's not as good as a plane ticket back home to dine, but it's not bad at all.\n\nPRO TIP: I understand the complaint with soggy sandwiches, so if you don't want it like that (dipped), ask for it dry, and ask for any peppers on the side.

I thought, \""Hmmm...a cheese steak with fries, coleslaw and an egg...what could go wrong?\""\n\nEVERYTHING. \n\nThe sandwiches are served on the softest bread that immediately soaks everything up and squishes paper-thin. I guess that's necessary because it's the only way you attempt to fit the giant disappointment in your mouth. The egg was flattened and dried out. The worst part of it was the meat. I became a little skeptical when i saw the cook carry out a box of frozen meat patties which made me reminiscent of time working at McDonald's in high school. The \""cheese steak\"" consists of a beef patty that wouldn't even make a satisfactory burger. It was completely flavorless.\n\nThe best parts of the sandwich were the coleslaw and fresh cut fries, which I would have preferred to have on their own.

I've been more times than I care to admit, so I feel more than qualified to bash this place.\n\nI'ma break it down for you piece by piece.\n\n1. The Bread: Folks love the bread! It's thickly-sliced and freshly baked! It makes the sandwich unmanageably large, though; you spend more time mashing the sandwich into a fittable size than you do actually eating it. Additionally, the bread is so thick it overpowers the meat and sticks to the roof of your mouth in a most unpleasant manner. \n\n2. The Meat: Really bad quality. The \""steak\"" is worse than Steak-ums. It's actually worse than the rubber mats that line the floor behind the bar. Saying it has flavor is a compliment. And the \""Big Fish\""? Gag. Van de Kamps. If that. \n\n3. The Cole Slaw: Tastes like cabbage that's been soaked in vinegar. It has crunch, but that's about all it has.\n\n4. The French Fries. Meh. Bland. \n\nAnd all this is glopped together, sliced, and served, rather unceremoniously, on wax paper. \n\nMany see this as Down n' Dirty or Good Ol' Boy style. No Frills.
