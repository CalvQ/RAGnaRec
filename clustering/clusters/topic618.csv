I drove over to an empty parking lot, lol, annnnnd I left. This little game went on a few more times (-1) til one Friday there was 1 car and 2 trucks, so, I went in. Hey and it's Karaoke night, not that I sing, I'm more in it for the chuckle at the silver hairs doing ol' blue eyes. It's a long place with tables and a bar. O and the standard outdoor smoking patio, 2 pool tables, jukebox, video games, table service, a bartender and a kitchen. I overheard the owner(Rich?) bragging his wings were better than Streets of New York, but I'd never had either to know. The Derby plays early on my Friday crawl that usually ends at the Timeout or Monkeypants. They have a decent selection of beer, even tho I usually get Fat Tire or Blue Moon, which are both on tap. The people there are nice enough, but I find that I usually just watch UFC on one of the many TVs as I drain my small pitcher and then push off to the next watering hole.\nMy only real beef is one time I  ordered a small pitcher of Blue Moon and it was totally skunked. I let the bartender know and asked if I could have something else. She said NO, and that no one else had complained. I had just come from 2 other bars drinking Blue Moon, It tasted like cider here and thats not how it tastes at all. The owner came over and questioned me. My only response was \""Hey, some customer service will cost you 2 bux right now, pretty cheap compared to what I can spend\"". I mean, they weren't going to give me fresh beer?

While the atmosphere at the bar wasn't unfriendly, it wasn't friendly either. Nothing like, \""be with you in moment\"" or \""what can I get you\"", but rather a somewhat removed bartender going through the perfunctory motions of his job and getting to you when he was good and ready, although without malice or attitude. Beyond that, the place seemed generally cheerless with a scattered assortment of that discomforting and singularly Vegasian type of the damned you run into occasionally off the Strip, not quite consigned to the clear, uncontested merit of hell, but somehow more vague and less defined--purgatorial or limbo-esqu--half plowed, engaged in chain smoking and vapid, pointless, loud conversation, or even worse, simply voiding any meaningful existence, head down, playing countertop video poker machines. The beer was certainly decent and what food came out of the kitchen looked adequate (at best).

The last thing we need in our quest to get rid of our beer guts is a place that serves great beer and good food 24 hours a day. I've noticed some comment that the beer here is watery, but I've noticed that about all the Las Vegas micro brews I've had. I guess when you're in the desert, you just aren't in the mood for a heavy, particle filled beer. \n\nThe bartender was really friendly and was patient with my friends who could not decide what they wanted. I went with the mango cream ale since I had heard a few people say it was really good. My friends both gave up trying to decide and went with samplers. I didn't know the samplers also included their seasonal brew (the mango cream ale) or else I would have gotten one as well. I enjoyed the ale a lot. The mango cream flavors were subtle. My friends both really like the Royal Red. One little quirk about the bar (or maybe it was just our bartender), but they could not take the tips while we were still there. He just left them on the bar even after we told him the money was for him.\n\nThere are no gaming machines at the bar, a rarity for a casino bar. If you'd like to get comp beers for playing, there is a bar in the casino that has all their beers on tap. You can also order their beers from any cocktail waitresses. That works out great since I do enjoy gaming, but I do still like to go into the brewpub once in awhile and pay for my beer (it is less than $4 for the large) so I can take in the atmosphere. The old school wooden bar is a nice place to hang out with friends. There is also a sushi and oyster bar during certain hours.",1.0,0.9585111737251282
