The room was a bit small but again clean. They also had breakfast \""in bed\"": they would leave a basket with some muffins, yogurt and fruits for you by the door.

One day they ran out of danishes, and on two of the mornings, it was impossible to get my coffee refilled.  The food is fine, but nothing special.  They really don't spice their dishes at all, very bland.  The service varies greatly.  On Sunday, we waited about a half hour for our food to arrive, and while my wife's was hot, mine was cold.  Given that the waiter asked us about our order, I think they forgot about us and wondered what that extra crepe was doing down there.\n\nWe also had noise issues one night.  Friday and Saturday was nice a quiet in our room, but Sunday we had someone in high heels pacing above us, and it sounded like we were on the terrace bar... and a party was going on.  Not a good nights sleep, but I don't know if that was just some rude guests, or if there is an issue as to how the rooms are laid out (we were in the new section).\n\nI must point out that the mattress was amazing... but I don't think they will let me sneak it out in our luggage... very comfortable.\n\nIt is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location.

At the heart of this location is Rue Saint-Paul, the oldest street in Montreal, first paved in 1672!  There were quite a variety of restaurants (and many places to shop if that's your thing) at the plaza, and even a few bars with live music along the waterfront, but Jardin Nelson caught our attention because they were offering live jazz in the center of their garden-centric dining area.  \n\nWe were outdoors, but the giant umbrellas (and I mean huge) overhead, flowing gardens and colorful lighting gave it a wonderfully intimate feel.  The jazz band was outstanding (just the right volume too) and the service quite solid.  I enjoyed a charcuterie pizza, which was divided into four sections, each with a different Italian meat.
