It was evening so we had the option of the one inside or outside. We chose outside, it was just a lovely night. So we make our way down and it turns out the cost is $30 for sharing a gondola or $60 for a private trip. Well luckily it was just myself and my friend so we chose the $30 ride. Our gondolier was female, which I thought was different but didn't mind. Then they took our picture before we ventured off into the night. Well our venture lasted all but 5 min we were sung a lovely Italian ballad and the voice was angelic but 5 min really for $30?? She was fun though and made it entertaining. Then we disembarked and of course there was our picture staring me in my face. The angle was BAD and I really didn't feel like spending another $25 especially on a bad pic. Then the girl got attitude with me like why don't you want it, what's wrong with it and I told her ME!! It's a BAD picture!!! Then she says why don't you give your email address in case you change your mind. I was like look I DON'T want the picture... Good Day!!

It's $16 shared boat and I think $60 private, why pay more for a private... it's practically the same. Our gondolianer was amazing. He sang two Italian songs and one English song. He was an awesome singer! The lights outside, the water, and the architecture outside of the Venetian created the perfect setting. I felt the ride was a lot longer than the indoor one and we went through either three tunnels or a tunnel three times, haha. I really loved it and I'm glad we went on the outdoor one.

I'd still probably stick with the indoor ride to avoid traffic noise ruining the ambiance.)\n\nOur gondolier, Salvatore, had a better singing voice than many of the Vegas acts that we saw during the week, and the architectural charm of the resort canal is truly charming.\n\nIf you're in Las Vegas with your sweetie and looking for a place far removed from the QR-code sweatshirt-wearing pornographic card flickers that flood The Strip, this is the place to go. Duck into the Venetian, have a romantic and elegant evening, and forget that just outside is one of the sleaziest streets in America.",1.0,0.996832311153412

The entrance / ticket booth for the outside ride is kinda tucked away in the back left corner, we had to ask a Venetian security guard to direct us to it. I asked at the ticket booth if we could use the passes that day and if there was a need to make a reservation and she said we could get on a gondola right now if we wanted but we would have to share with another couple. Ok no problemo.\n\nIt was one of the chillier days in Vegas at about 2 pm the first week of December. So they offered us a blanket to drape over us and they also asked us to pose for a photo, which we never even saw. No biggie, I don't think we would have paid for it anyway. The other couple we were seated across from asked us to take their picture with their camera and they returned the favor for us.\n\nOur gondolier was very nice and friendly and yes she was talkative, asking us where we from and so on. I know that turns some people off, but we enjoyed her conversation. When the bell tower rang she explained how it was a replica of a bell tower in Venice. She sang \""Al Di La\"" to us in a beautiful voice and then gave us a brief English translation of the lyrics. \n\nIf there was anything at all that upset me, it was the loud blaring disco music being played at the ice skating rink outside the Venetian they had set up for their \""Winter in Venice\"" festival. It was so loud that it made her song almost impossible to hear. She even apologized for it when she was done singing. Not her fault. \n\nNot only could she sing, she could steer the hell out of that gondola too. I forget how long the ride actually was, but it was fun, and romantic. Will do again, maybe next time inside or outside in warmer weather.",1.0,0.981200635433197
