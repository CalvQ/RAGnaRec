Located a short hop from the strip with a dinosaur on the roof (perhaps escaping the zombie hordes itself), it THE one stop shot for all your Zombie Apocalypse needs.\n\nNeed a sword to decapitate zombies? It's there and in different styles. King Authur type swords, swords for ninjas, to even scimitars! Want to get close and personal? Strap on some Wolverine type claws and never drop your weapon, Bub.\n\nSwords and Claws not your thing? Or did your plucky group of survivors discover  these zombies weak against electicity or in the beginning stages of turning? Use a tazer instead. Useful if a loved one just turned and you just can't shoot him or her... yet.\n\nBut let's be realistic. The tools are fine but without the properly training, you'll be joing the ranks of the undead. Thankfully there's a wide assortment of training dummies and targets you can purchase to practice killing (again) the undead.\n\nWhile weapons are fine, you still have to survive day to day. No problem! Buy some emergency rations and eat like a king all while getting enough nutrition you'll need for zombie cardio. If Z - Day isn't here yet, take some of the food with you camping. It'll help with the food budget and if the zombies do attack, well you'll have plenty of food in the woods while the city folk starve since Pizza Hut isn't delivering.\n\nWhile the zombie apocalypse won't come until the secret labs perfect their reanimation formula, use the store to help prepare you for any disaster. If you're protected against zombies, then bad weather, stuck out in the desert, no power, or anything similar will be a snap. \n\nAs strange as it sounds, preparing for zombies is preparing for life.\n\nSo check out the Zombie Apocalypse not only for the tools you'll need but a celebration of zombie culture. Pick up a poster, the Zombie Survival guide, or even meet Max Brooks when he does another signing. \n\nIt would be a grave mistake not to!",0.0,0.9952878952026368

There's an area on the right side of the shop where you can shoot zombies at the mini-shooting gallery, and this other interactive thing where you can burn a zombie or so.\n\nAside from that, the shop also has the typical fair of zombie 'souvenirs' such as T-shirts, mugs, books, etc. for those who want to get their cheesy zombie fix. There's even books on how to make Twinkies. Speaking of which, one of the walls at the back has an actual Twinkie on display.

Its okay....hes only 5, i guess its only fun when he and dad play \""zombies\"" at home, not when they are on t.v. and walking around.\n\nAnyway....she said if i check in on Facebook and \""like\"" their page you can get a free rubber bracelet, so i did. I also got a magnet for my fridge. I tried to get my wife to let me buy our son a shirt but she said no :(  i really wanted to get him one and told her next time we go to Vegas, i definately am.....especially since they were $15 and when we got home, i checked online and they are more money and u gotta pay shipping  DAMN IT!!!\n\nSo we left, and not without having her take a pic of me with the sexy zombie statue outside.

I can't really think of another place that caters to zombie fanatics 100%. And since everyone seems to love zombies these days, this kind of joint near Pittsburgh is as much of a shoo-in as another tattoo parlor or bar.\n\nI've been here two or three times. The store itself is rather small, but it's always well-stocked. Plenty of t-shirts, movies, graphic novels, novelties and the like. The owner is really nice and seems well versed in his store's subject matter when I've heard him talking to other customers. I'm not a superfreak about zombies, though I do like them, so you could rattle off all sorts of tidbits about them and it would probably be 95% new info to me.\n\nMy main complaint with this store is that all the stuff is way overpriced. I get that it's a boutique and that it's filling a niche, but ten bucks for a bag of plastic zombies that are of the same quality as a bag of plastic soldiers that you can get for a fraction of the cost seems like overkill. Just because they're zombies doesn't mean there necessarily needs to be a premium added to the price.\n\nLikewise, the shirts run rather high. The one I liked was 27 bucks. I bought it because I had some extra dough on me, but otherwise I would have given it a pass. It shrank up rather quickly, too, even though I followed the washing directions. So it goes.\n\nThe other little toys, books, and especially the movies, are all stuff you can find online for cheaper as well. Probably the posters, too, but posters often run high. I know it's sad to say that so many more bargains can be found through online shopping these days when owners of stores like this mean well and are trying to bring something cool and unique to the community, but when you have other expenses, 27 dollar shirts suddenly seem less attractive and a hunt for similar items online begins.\n\nStill, it's a very cool store, though I also think it could be a bit bigger, though I don't know what else they would possibly stuff in a larger area.
