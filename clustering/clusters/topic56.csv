This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days.  Their excuse?  The headlamp that came in didn't have a bulb with it.  Seriously?  Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.

The damage was minor, and the repairs took less than 48 hours to complete. My policy provides a rental car, and Enterprise was there when I checked in with my vehicle and the rental process was streamlined and easy.

After I saw the good reviews, I figured it'd be worth a shot, and was surprised at how awful the people were.\n\nRuffing originally suggested I take my car to a dealer, since it's an uncommon model and they didn't know what the problem was.  I asked if I could just pay for a vehicle diagnostic, since they're more likely to be honest than a dealership. They said it would take around a day-and-a-half to get to it.\n\nAlmost three days later, I hadn't heard back from them.  Since I need my car on a daily basis, it was frustrating that they were well past their quoted time with no updates as to what was going on.  The repairs are what should take time - not a diagnostic.\n\nMy biggest issue was the attitude I received when I called.  When I called to see why there was a delay, the mechanic became agitated.  His tone became condescending when he told me it's my fault for leaving the car with him -- that I just HAD to have him look at it and I was SO against going elsewhere.  He said he had cars sitting there for weeks that he hasn't even touched yet (?) so he can't bother with mine. Ultimately I had to get my car towed to a dealership anyway, since I couldn't afford to have my car sit at their shop for \""weeks\"".\n\nI wished they were more up front with how back logged they were, rather than trying to give me a schedule they couldn't abide by, and then take their stress out on me when I followed up with them.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this mechanic to anyone.  You're better off going somewhere that has realistic wait-times and up front communication.

She said they can call their insurance company to add collision insurance and cancel it after they return the car or get the damage waiver.  Because he thought it was the LAW he got the damage waiver.  I looked on their website which it states that damage waiver is completely OPTIONAL, so I called Christal and she told me it was a gray area and in Nevada it was STATE LAW.  She then said they could have gotten the car without the damage waiver but the manager would require a deposit for the full amount of the vehicle! I asked if all the Enterprises were like that and she said yes.  I called another Enterprise and they said damage waiver is OPTIONAL and there is NO DEPOSIT needed even if you only have liability insurance.  I called back and spoke with the manage Daniel who told me that Christal was just saying liability insurance is Nevada State Law, if that was the case then why would he need to call his insurance company??? Daniel then told me a fake story of a customer that wrecked a car and didn't have insurance so he had to pay $5000 out of pocket! Really?!? Enterprise, the largest car rental company in America doesn't have secondary insurance on their fleet of vehicles? That is the risk of rental car business, so I am sure their cars are insured! Daniel then tells me we can come back and get our money back since my uncle has a major credit card and that usually has insurance for rental cars.  Sure enough we call Mastercard and it IS covered.

They respected the fact that I wanted to test drive other vehicles before making a decision. None of them tried to detain me or resort to these tactics.. None of them kept badgering me with the same question asked in multiple ways: \""So what is the next step\""  How likely are you to buy a car today? Tell me what you want to do next? What can we do to get you to buy today? If we offer you a great deal, would you buy this car now? What is your plan after you leave the dealership?  Are you trading in or paying cash?

That's why I waited quite some time before posting a review.  I'm going to give very little opinion here and just let the facts speak for themselves...\n\nPurchase:  Our dealings with the sales people were pretty typical.  However the finance guy repeatedly lied to me about the extended service options and other coverage options (not a matter of opinion, he outright told me things contrary to what they said in writing and I had to point it out).  I ended up requesting a different person later in order to get the service plans that I wanted.  And that person was simply awesome, helpful, honest, and attentive.\n\nOn the first service trip in, they were supposed to do a paint sealant re-application (Zaktek), computer upgrade, alignment and check a few things.  First off, it took them a day longer than promised.  When I picked it up, I found that they hadn't done the Zaktek at all.  And the alignment didn't help the pulling problem, but now the steering wheel was crooked!  It was straight when I drove it into the shop.\n\nI just did another visit to get the Zaktek application done.  They did it this time, and it was done by the time promised.  But they left a bunch of extra product in various places that dripped down the side of the Jeep. leaving big white chunky streaks of the product in five places around the vehicle.  They couldn't wipe this off?  The service writer tried to sneak in a $15 \""necessary oil additive\"" on the authorization form on top of their expensive $45 regular oil change.  I had to argue to have that removed, and to have them just use exactly what the book recommends.  I also reminded him that the web site showed a $5 off special.\n\nOf course, when I picked it up, the $5 off wasn't on the bill.\n\nI'll bring it in for the things I absolutely have to do at the dealer, but otherwise the Jeep goes elsewhere for all services.\n\nUPDATE:  A few days after the service, I decided to double-check all the fluids since I was doing a 700 mile trip and towing a trailer.  I found that the coolant was very low, and they hadn't checked the power steering at all.  I could tell because the PS fluid bottle and cap were covered with oil and dirt which hadn't been disturbed.  So even with the very expensive oil change, they didn't bother to check and top up the other fluids, which every does with an oil change.\n\nUPDATE:  I called the person who replied to the review and left a voicemail.

The second thing is he wouldn't take debit card EVEN THOUGH it was a 'visa' card, and after a debate he finally got his manager who said ok we'll take it and hey presto the charges went through fine.\n\nWe got 2 ford fusions, one of which was perfect, the other was not. The second car had a max speed set, a max volume on the radio at about 50%, air con not working and a rumbling noise. This car was returned later that day and swapped which wasn't a big deal but it was a hassle as this office is out of the way, the cars should be checked and maintained to a higher standard, at least with working air con for our drive in August! \n\nI returned the car on time, to the office in san diego and the guy said that I would receive my deposit within a week. Three weeks past, still no deposit so I decided to contact them.. No response.. Contacted them again by email.. No response.. These people have not refunded my deposit and will not even answer my questions or deal with the issue?

He has completely changed my perspective on dealerships. \n\nWhen I finally decide to buy a new car I will only buy one from this dealership because of him and the service he has provided. He went well over above and beyond what I could have expected from anyone. This is a huge relief to me and to my family because they live so far away from me.

Pretty much for convenience and thinking that a dealership would be dependable.\n\nI had a a/c compressor changed due to just warm air blowing which cost an arm and a leg but in the middle of summer you just have to do what you have to do to get it done. After about 5 months or so the air started working erratically and brought it in again. The front counter was rude and not willing to help without charging me an $160 diagnostic charge. I thought this was ridiculous and they did not relent. \n\nI am now looking for a new service center for my repairs. Upon writing this review I am over at Japanese Car Service because of their Yelp reviews and their diagnostic charge was only $43. Way below Acura's ask.

Upon arrival there were no SUV's available.  Eventually they said they had an SUV (Volvo XC70).  Turns out that the Volvo XC70 is a station wagon. (Per Volvo's website this is a \""wagon\"", the XC90 is Volvo's SUV/Crossover).  When I tried to call to arrange for a replacement there was no way to reach the branch.  Their call center said that I could contact customer service in the AM.  They also said there were no supervisors on duty.  Hotwire could not be reached as well.  We reached the Branch finally and the person on the phone said and XC70 is listed on their website as a standard size SUV and it is.  However, a rental car company calling a wagon as a SUV does not make it so.  Car rental companies often call something large than it is (eg. an epa rated midsize is often called a full size vehicle) but declaring a car a different class in a blind buy is truly beyond the pale.  Stars off for Sixt for including a different class of vehicle in their list of equivalents.  Stars off for inability to reach any sort of customer service in a reasonable time frame. Otherwise, Sixt is normally decent in PHX. They (as all others) do have an issue with vehicle availability.  When you get your vehicle the cars are very clean and in great condition.  \n\nConsider NEVER using Hotwire and book direct with the Rental Car agency so you know what you are getting (even though Hotwire is often 1/2 the price of direct booking.)",0.0,0.9922094345092772

I was headed out if town and needed to know in order to handle the rental situation. I was informed it would most likely be done the next day and they would call me. No call.

I tried to put my keys in the ignition and they were the wrong keys. I took then keys back to the service manager and he said okay I will be right back. After 25 minutes he came and told me he will find them and bring the car to me. THEY LOST MY KEYS. I got back my rental car and went back to work.\n\nNo call from them so I called at 545 to see what was going on. When asking for the services manager by name I was told he was gone for the day.\n\nThe next day he called and found the keys were sent out of state with another customer and I could get my car by the following day. This finally happened and the service manger brought me my car to my office for me which was very nice but because I was at work I didn't get chance to inspect the work until I got home late from work that day.\n\nThe drivers side door review mirror was installed wrong and didn't work properly. My back tail light didn't work \nThere was broken glass all through out my vehicle.\nMy license plate was only screwed in with one screw and was hanging sideways.\nWhen I called the service manager he said he would order me new rear view mirror and call me when he had done so. It is five days later and no call.\n\nThey are polite and the body work looks great. But I am disappointed by the lack of accountability and professionalism.
