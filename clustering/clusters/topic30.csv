I'm a huge fan of vindaloo, which is often the spiciest item on an Indian menu (at least in the United States), but at Taste of India, it's about as spicy as a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli.  I've tried asking for a spicy level of 11 on a scale of one to ten.  I've tried asking for \""traditional Indian\"" heat.  No dice.  Chef Boyardee Vindaloo, every time.\n\nAnother problem is the take-out ordering process.  My wife and I have ordered take-out a couple times recently, and each time, we placed two orders for naan and only received one.  Since we live in Point Breeze, going back to the restaurant for $3 worth of naan isn't worth the effort, but really, we should have just received the naan in the first place.\n\nGiven these issues, why do we keep going back to Taste of India?

I hadn't tried any Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I went ahead and ordered several take out dishes to try. It might be important to note I'd had a huge curry craving for months. Maharani, while it definitely hit the spot, was lacking in a few areas.\n\nI called in the order and then went to pick it up. It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous.\n\nI tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case!). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. \n\nLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt... a lot.",1.0,0.879725456237793

I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce?

It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really.

Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat.

Flavors of India, however, seems to satisfy my palate. I enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time. I have also tried the curry chicken, which is also very tasty. The chicken is very fresh and tender, both the light and dark meat. The naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste, but it does its job. I really enjoy their basmati rice. It's not the most elaborate or flavorful I've ever had, but for some reason, I'm drawn to it, and even crave it. There's no saffron or cloves; it's a bit on the simple side, and just a tad bit sticky. The samosas are decent, although I have had better. If you are in the mood for some Indian food, and this place is close by, I suggest you head on over. Prices are reasonable. Two can eat for 30 bucks, including multiple appetizers. The food is prepared quickly. It's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it's interesting Indian decor with a twist of Mexican thrown in. At least that's my impression.

And by standard, I mean this is what you will find at almost every Indian restaurant in America. I am no Genuine Indian food expert, but your average USA Indian restaurant will have the same menu as every other one, no matter what city or state you're in. \n\nThat being said, if that's what you're in the mood for, then FOI will fit the bill. It's in a very sad-looking strip mall, and the management of the restaurant must be very anxious about all of the empty storefronts around them.

We ordered the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, naan, and a cauliflower and potato dish. All were very tasty and served with basmati rice. \n\nI have two criticisms of the food:\n1)the onions in the tandoori dishes were raw. Perhaps if we had eaten there, they would have been served in a cast-iron skillet, which would have improved matters. I'll withhold final judgment until we try it again. The meats were all very good, though.\n\n2)OILY. Oh my goodness, there must have been equal parts oil and vegetables in the cauliflower dish. I wonder if Indian restaurants are under the impression that Americans really do want their food swimming in oil and that's why they make it that way, or if true Indian food, in India, is also as oily as what you'll find at restaurants here? I don't have the answer. \n\n**I will put in a plug here for Bombay Spice, at Tatum and Shea, which is Indian food made healthfully, without nearly as much oil or cream as most restaurants. I wish I could count on that everywhere. **\n\nSo, it was a solid 3-star experience, given that it met my expectations of very oily, very tasty average Indian food.

I mentioned this in passing to one of my coworkers, and he emphatically suggested India Gate, saying it was the best Indian food he has had in Valley, even after conducting a lengthy but informal taste test of the Valley's other Indian offerings. He then warned me that it would look like a hole-in-the-wall, with a secluded location within a Chandler shopping center. \n\n\nSo, when I had a particularly powerful hankering for Indian food one night, I decided to make the trip from north Tempe to west Chandler to check out this place once and for all.  And I wasn't disappointed. This is, indeed, a gem of a restaurant.  I decided on the bhindi masala, which is okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices. I am a big fan of okra, which, sadly, doesn't seem to make it onto many restaurant menus. My dish was incredibly flavorful and one of the most memorable of the year. I have since returned to try India Gate's malai kofta (vegetable dumplings in an incredible cheese sauce,  vegetable korma,  veggie fried rice, bengan bharta and samosas. Everything has proved to be delicious.\n\nHowever, the restaurant is not without its drawbacks. The service I've received has been awkward at best, if not a touch rude. Also, many on the serving staff speak with thick Indian accents that I found hard to understand. Once, I even received the garlic naan instead of the plain naan because I couldn't understand my waiter when he was repeating my order back to me. For some, I realize that would be a pretty cool mistake, but garlic gives me heartburn surely invented by El Diablo himself. I would go here even more often if it weren't for the communication barrier.\n\nLike my coworker, I highly recommend this place as one of the Valley's tastiest., even when considering the less than desirable service I've received there.

Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.\n\nWe started off our meal with two kinds of naan - one stuffed with lamb and one stuffed with chicken.  The lamb naan was very mediocre - the meat inside was completely dry and not very flavorful.  The chicken naan didn't seem to have any chicken in it, so I'm not sure what happened there.\n\nWe ordered our entrees and were asked if we wanted rice with them.  We said yes, but when our check came out we discovered that they charged us $2 per person for rice.  Seriously, two bucks each for a little thing of rice with our entrees.  $2 could've bought each of us a 5-pound bag of rice at the grocery store.  Also, it would have been nice if they had mentioned to us that we would be charged for the rice.  But I can't stop wondering why they charged at all for rice - every Indian place I've ever been to just brings rice out with the entree.  So this pissed me off, and I would've given Royal Taj 3 stars if they hadn't charged us for rice.\n\nThe entrees themselves were alright, I'd say very average as far as Indian food goes.  They were flavorful and the spice level was about where I expected it to be, but I've definitely had better Indian food before (not anywhere in the Phoenix area though).\n\nWhen we were done with our entrees, we ordered some Indian coffee.  About 10-15 minutes passed with no sign of our coffee.  Then, they brought us our check which had the Indian coffee on it.  We waited for our server to walk by so we could mention we never got the coffee, and after another 5-10 minutes, our server finally came by and brought us the coffee.  This was kind of upsetting.\n\nAlso, not that this has any effect on my rating of Royal Taj, but we had a lot of difficulty communicating with our server and the rest of the restaurant staff.  It didn't seem like anyone spoke English very well - when we asked for something, we received a confused look and then the person walked away.  This made our experience more difficult.\n\nOverall, I'd say Royal Taj is overpriced and the food is just very average (at best).

Yes, I recognize that Indian restaurants in Phoenix generally suck.  So with that in mind, Royal Taj is the second best Indian restaurant in the valley (Guru Palace is #1). In another city with quality Indian restaurants, this restaurant would get 3.5 to 4 starts but for Phoenix, it's the best.  It's a true Indian Punjabi restaurant that makes great Malai Kofta, Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Boti Kebob and Tandoori chicken.  They serve their tandoori dishes on sizzling clay plates which even nice restaurants like Dehli Palace (Tempe: University and Rural) doesn't do.\n\nThat being said, the restaurant isn't without it's flaws. It's located in an abandoned strip mall that can feel unsafe at times with strange people walking around.  In addition, the restaurant had a bad odor the other night.  The service needs improvement.  There is essentially one server for the entire restaurant (the wife of the cook). She is very sweet but doesn't speak English well but she understands English perfectly.  The lamb is a little dry.  I would stick to their curries. \n\nWith all of this being said, it is the second best Indian restaurant in the valley.

So tasty :\\\n\nThe biggest drawback to the place is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's very friendly and well intentioned. But it totally lacks in that fluid, excellent service that can elevate a restaurant experience. The owners handle the service [as well as seemingly everything else] and this can lead to occasional long waits to get your check, or have your card run. There's also a language gap, which would make it difficult for somebody who doesn't know Indian cuisine to get informed answers to questions about the menu.\n\nIt's also, as other have mentioned, a bit of a bummer to me that they have a FULL bar, and yet I cannot imagine that if I ordered a drink other than a rum and coke they'd possibly get it right. I know most people don't go to Indian food to get sauced but it's always nice to have the option, particularly if they're going to have the full bar.\n\nDespite all these negatives, I still rate the place tops, second only to Star of India [where the food is at least as good, if not slightly better, and everybody speaks English fluently]\n\nI recently moved very close to this place, which has been a real trial of temptation. So far I've limited myself to no more than twice a month but I'm not sure how long I can keep up that level of restraint :]",1.0,0.9625125527381896

We have tried Indian food all over town and in a few other cities and they all fall short when compared to Royal Taj. Royal Taj has the best basmati rice. Their garlic naan is always fresh and looked forward to. Every dish is amazing. Their Marsala and their korma are what we order the most. The sauces and gravies are rich and flavorful. The paneer tiki is a wonderful dish, as is the saag paneer as they both have amazing paneer cheese with a wonderful flavor and perfect texture. They have a full bar and great Indian beers as well as other import beers. This is real Indian food made by a nice Indian family. They even adjust the spiciness of each dish to your order.  We always stick with the medium spice.  If you go to the lunch buffet everything will be of a mild spice, but you can always order an entree for lunch instead of the buffet if you want it spicier.  My wife is a vegetarian and I'm a big meat eater and we both have allot to choose from here.  Long story short, if you like Indian food, Royal Taj is for you.

They only had about four or five main dish choices--a fraction of what the newer places are offering. \n\nThe food was not as good as I remember either. For example, I've had some supremely awesome tandoori chicken lately, and Maharaja Palace was average at best compared to those; same with their chicken tikka masala--good, but not memorable. \n\nService was decent as always.

Both entrees served with basmati rice.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was NOT what we were expecting.  Prepared completely different from any other Indian restaurant we've ever tried.  I was expecting yummy curry sauce, but this hardly had any.  Although it wasn't badly prepared, it just wasn't up to our liking.  The shrimp vindaloo was nothing spectacular either.  This had more curry sauce than the chicken tikka masala, but nothing impressive.  I like curry sauce to be thick, this was more watery.  Lastly, the garlic naan and basmati rice were just average.  I didn't care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at Mt. Everest.\n\nSigghh.. what a disappointing meal.

We had asked for both to be medium spicy but the chef must have put the spice in twice, it was so hot that it was barely edible. The garlic and regular nan, on the other hand, was excellent. The rice that came with it lacked all of the cardamon pods etc in it that I've always had with indian carry out.... it was just plain, really dry, unseasoned rice.\n\nAfter tossing out most of it both of us felt very ill and bloated after the meal, i really thought I was going to vomit.

But, only one bread for $12? Samosa was small and its potato filling was plain? Why do you have to serve rice/samosa with chhole bhature? You serve only chhole, 2 pieces of bhatura and Indian pickle salad with green chutney. This is a norm all across India and all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, Philly and NYC follow the same.

The puffy bread with my dish was like a light, unsweetened funnel cake - fried, indulgent deliciousness - and it sopped up the chana so very well.  The chana were perfect.  Husband's aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty, and the garlic naan just blew me away.  Yum to absolutely everything.  We also ordered a couple samosas, which were also perfect... just the right amount of spice, and flaky beyond belief.\n\nThe service was excellent, for what it's worth. \n\nAlthough we've got Maharani around the corner (which I like very much), as well as Copper (which underwhelms me, despite all its hoopla), I imagine we'll be making the well-worth-it drive out to Woodlands when we're in the mood for particularly fabulous Indian food.

Once we had the Samosas, the rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, but waiting until 8:40 for our food was agonizing.

I've never been unpleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.\n\nI have made it a point to try a new dish on a regular basis. I have yet to find a curry (with or without meat) that failed to please me. The aroma of the food is what draws me in.

(The restaurant wasn't too busy that evening so my rating may be skewed because of that)  I didn't give them a full 5 stars because they were ALWAYS there at the table or near by. I would suggest to them to be able to \""read\"" the table better and adjust their services accordingly. But I definitely give them credit for being courteous and anticipating our needs, like asking if we'd like more rice. \n\nFood was delicious, spices were just right without being too spicy. The chutney's served in the beginning of our meal were tasty as well. We ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh, Lamb Masala, and Chicken Vindaloo. The meats were very tender and the curries were tasting light. We also ordered chapati and the plain naan which were amazing! This was the best naan I've ever had, texture was light and airy, so soft it melted in your mouth! We had Mango Lassi's to drink and complimented the spicy notes in our food. The Lassi was not too sweet and perfectly tangy. Pleasantly, at the end of our meal they brought out clean hot towels for us to refresh our hands with.\n\nWe had leftovers and to my surprise the next day, the server had put a scoop of rice in the container for us to enjoy with our leftover curry! \n\nWe will definitely be back!",1.0,0.9996015429496764

We ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course. The mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs (both seekh and tikkas of chicken, lamb and beef) laid on a THICK bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges. It arrived sizzling hot, and several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from!  I dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation, but it was a rude shock. The chicken was dry to the mouth. The seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices (mainly red pepper), and the quantity--so abysmal! The bed of onions probably weighed more in quantity than the meat. The tikkas were standard fare...oily and spicy gravy, with cubed pieces of chicken.

I guess it's a sign when an Indian restaurant starts out with an a la carte menu, then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing, it means hard times.  They are strapped and desperate for business.  Too bad I won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless I'm dragged.

At about $13, India Palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over Mint (which is more Nepalese, if I'm not mistaken), Mt. Everest or India Oven, but not even Ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety.  Every day there is a pilaf, lentils, Tandoori Chicken, a Saag dish, a Korma, a Tikka, a Masala, a Salad, both Mango Custard and Kheer, Naan and Sauces (Raita, Tamarind, Mint and a few others.).  For a vegetarian, this is one of the best buffets for you.  The break down always has at least 4-5 vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils - most others are not nearly as diverse.  For the carnivore, the selection is by no means meager - at least 1-2 chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish.  Alone, the spread is great, but, having eaten here dozens of times, I have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that I can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food.  This can't be said, in my opinion, of others.  \n\nSecondly, I find, despite the opinions of others, the dinner to be reasonably priced for the quality.  If you consider that Indian restaurants are usually priced well-above other non-European, Ethnic cuisines, it is easy to think of them as pricey, but the complexity of Indian curries and the time-to-cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak.  Also, if you consider the consistent quality of the food, India Palace is worth the extra buck you MIGHT pay over Bollywood or Mint.  Additionally, I find them to be cheaper than Tamba or Origin.\n\nWhat can I say, I'm a huge fan!",1.0,0.9971179962158204

I remember it fondly.  It may have been almost two years ago but the taste of curry lingers long in my soul.  It was a rainy night in October of 2010 and I had a Groupon half priced offer.  So I grabbed a friend and went.  He had tried Indian previously and knew to order the garlic naan.  Delicious.  He ordered Tikka Masala.  I ordered Chicken Sagwala.  Both were quite good.  I ordered mine with medium spice.  It provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy.  Though I did need some Tums shortly after.  The meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something I can best describe as Indian chips and salsa.  Crispy little pieces of flat bread with three different sauces.  One was very strong with the red chili flavor.  One was heavy on the mint.  The third I recall as being sweeter and almost fruity.  All very good.  I was surprised at how much food I received.  I was very full afterwards.  I had to walk around the Boulevard Mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop (see my review for Hofbrauhaus).  After eating at India Palace, I knew I was hooked.  The flavors are intense but balanced so well.  I drive by some times when in the University neighborhood and I am always tempted to stop in. I am usually short on time and cash though.  In any case, the food was great when I went.  The service was okay.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable.

There's a lot of seating inside and the staff is really nice. A good starting menu item is the masala dosai - a large, thin rice crepe stuffed with potatoes.

I had the kedhai bendhi, which is spicy okra with rice. The flavor of the actual okra was good, but it's obvious that the okra was a few days old and dried out (especially compared to the fresh slices of onion and bell pepper cooked along side the okra).

Recently I was in the mood for great Indian cuisine but did not have any desire to sit in a restaurant.  So, having heard mostly positive things about Copper, I made the decision to place an order for pick-up.\n\nFood - I ordered the Khoya Malai Maans which consisted of chunks of lamb in a red curry sauce w/ whole toasted spices. This was accompanied with a pan of basmati rice.  I also ordered the Plain Naan (buttered) and the Saffron, Almond, Paneer Kulcha.  This along w/ a chicken curry dish for my g/f came out to be about $50, which I thought to be extremely expensive.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by the India Garden in Pittsburgh, PA (near the University of Pitt http://www.indiagarden.net/ ) that offers 50% dine-in dinners every night after 11 PM or maybe this was just freakin' expensive!!  Anyway, being that this was so pricey I expected to be blown away.  I was not.  While the g/f's chicken dish was tasty and well made, my dish consisted of diced lamb that was on the tough side.  The spices of the dish were great but tough lamb is something a good Indian restaurant should never have on your plate.  The naan was \""okay\"" and the Kulcha was tasteless.  I was left pretty disappointed.\n\nService - Order was taken promptly over the phone and there were no errors w/ what I had ordered.\n\nOverall - With this experience, I now cannot wait until Thanksgiving week to head over to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh, sit down, and order some very tasty Indian food.  I hope I do not get arrested while there because I now realize the place in Pittsburgh has a steal of a meal.\n\nPS - I will provide a review of Indian Garden while there a month from now.",0.0,0.9950136542320251

The single slice of complimentary naan is not enough for most people so we ordered a serving of garlic naan, and boy was it good! Paired with this was a variety of chutneys that were very tasty. I especially liked the mint chutney. For my entree I had some sort of lamb curry which I did not each much of because I thought the lamb was fairly tough and the curry was really just too strong to eat by itself. My date kindly shared his chicken tikki masala with me which was much easier on my palate and easier to chew. The second time I was here for lunch with fellow yelper Adam R. and this time I just went for the chicken tikki masala to be safe, while my dining partner decided to be ambitious and got some sort of peppery lamb curry. It looked very hot so I didn't touch it for fear of having to run to the bathroom on a quest for water. One thing I miss about lunch here is instead of naan and chutney they give just give you soup or salad. The salad looked decent enough, but being the curious cat that I am I opted for soup. Well this soup I think could've been used for pizza sauce and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. I just spread some on my naan and ate it like that.\n\nOur waiter was perfectly decent and kept water glasses refilled the majority of the time for both visits, and duriing lunch it is pretty empty and we got to sit in the nice sun room instead of crammed into a corner at dinner.

The \""Murgh Chicken Tikka Masala\"" is delicious, but it's definitely enough for two, especially if you are getting anything else. I had the soup of the day, which was a delicious creamy roasted red pepper puree. (Not spicy at all - like roasted red bell peppers.)

I am not in a disco club and don't want to start throwing glow-sticks around the room. The music was way too loud and like house electronica and indian. Weird, not my cup of tea for wanting a relaxing meal. Also if you want some better curb appeal put some flowers in those flower pots as you walk in the building, the dead flowers that were probably there from last year can be replaced. And do something about those pillars that look like they had old wallpaper wrapped around them from many years ago.\n\nClosing out. The tip was already included with your price. So be ready to pay the 15-30 percent of your total bill when you checkout. I don't remember seeing that on the menu (it may have been there, but didn't recall it.\n\nOverall, 3 out of 5.   Wish had more of a selection instead of a 1 page menu, and the music selection.

Which was pretty good.\nFor an appetizer we did the Amritsari Garlic Chicken. It was a nice presentation but very lite on the seasoning and a very small portion. lucky if it were 3 oz. For an App this small and bland it just isn't worth it to order at all.\nFor dinner My wife ordered her fav dish (Chicken Chittinadu) and she requested spicy, real spicy and I ordered mine the Murgh Tikka Masala. Once again the presentation was fancy but the meal was very light on spices. My dish was really more like a thick tomato soup with chicken than a spicy Tikka Masala like I am used to and Hers was barely negligible on the spicy level.\nLastly and the biggest thing I didn't like was adding in 30% gratuity automatically on a $37 bill the tip was auto billed in at $11. This was for a party of TWO people.\nOverall it is a nice Indian Restaurant if you have never had Indian Food before and want someplace nice to take a date.\nSave some cash and a go to Passage To India (University Area).

It was a good portion of each component, with the slightly greasy bhatura flatbread, piquant crisp vegetables, white rice, and richly flavored mattar paneer. The only negative about the mattar paneer was that the peas were overcooked, and thus grey and a bit mushy. They don't hold back on the heat, and for those that like more mild food, you've been warned!\n\nService was pleasant from the front and the back. Prices are very reasonable. The special was $5.99 and I was full after only eating half my meal. I also grabbed a container of gulab jamun ($4.99) from the refrigerated dessert section which contained a lot of the sweet dumplings and was pretty good. \n\nDefinitely a good option for tasty yet cheap Indian food!",1.0,0.9949575066566468

I took a dinner break and met a friend of mine at Tandoori Village.  I was thrilled, since I haven't had Indian food since moving to Arizona.  I still can't smell quite right, but even so, I could tell that this place smelled good.\n\nNow, the other reviewers are right with one thing.  The place isn't much to look at.  But it's not a theme restaurant or some fancy-pants hipster fusion restaurant, so I'm not gonna knock it for that.  They were playing Bollywood movies on the tv, and that was enough for me.\n\nIf you like nan, it's good enough here to make it worth the trip.  We had some potato, some onion, and some garlic nan.  I've never had garlic nan before.  It was one of the most garlic-y things I'd ever eaten.  Aside from the fact I'm gonna kill any vampires within a mile, it was fantastic.\n\nThe main dishes were all also good.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Curry dishes were delicious and had enough kick that it helped clear my head.  And the paneer was a wonderfully mild contrast between the two spicy dishes.  All the food was presented well (as well as Indian fod can, to be fair) and everything was clean.\n\nFor what we paid, we got a lot of food.  Even so, the late-evening food coma that's keeping me from studying may cause some grief later.  Ah well, at least it was for a good meal.",1.0,0.999525547027588

But ... \n\nThe menu has been changed recently, forgoing names of dishes for lengthy descriptions that make finding what you want a challenge.

Came here as part of a group of seven, which is perfect for this type of restaurant, because we were able to order a bunch of dishes and try a little of each.\n \nWe started with the onion bhajis and Bombay bhelpurri. The latter is puffed rice mixed with onions and tomatoes in a tamarind sauce. I'd never tried this dish before and it was very tasty. The puffed rice gave it an interesting texture different from most dishes you typically find in an Indian restaurant.\n\nFor our mains, we shared the the lamb vindaloo, chana masala (chickpea curry), Rajastani paneer and southern grilled fish. The fish was a bit disappointing (lacklustre and slightly overcooked) but the other three dishes were excellent. I'm not a huge lamb fan so my favourites were the chana masala (very spicy and flavourful) and most of all the Rajastani paneer. This was a paneer (Indian cheese) dish in a carrot-based sauce that also contained bell peppers and cashew paste. Again, I had never tried this particular type of paneer before, but I absolutely loved it and will definitely keep an eye out for it in Indian restaurants in my 'hood. It was rich, creamy and delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere was I suppose what you would expect in an Indian restaurant (Indian-style decor but with a lot of modern touches), with the exception that instead of Indian music, they were playing random pop music. A little out of place with the atmosphere I thought, at least until later in the evening when it becomes more of a \""bar\"" atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the service was very good and we had a great experience here.

This is like... the Panda Express of Indian food with a really nice atmosphere (this should have been my first warning).  The total bill for two people came out to about $50.

I'm a bread lover, and naan is easily one of the best types of bread in the world... usually...  This one was... good.  Not great, certainly not amazing like it should be... just good.\n\nGarlic naan - I have to give them kudos on their garlic naan.  It had a better flavor than many of the others I've had.  Garlic naan usually doesn't stack up against regular naan, but this one was actually better than their plain naan.  That's not the best compliment, but it's the only one they're going to get today!\n\nChicken Tikka Masala - Hmm... Like naan, it is one of the dishes that I judge an Indian restaurant on...  Usually, rich, creamy, and surprisingly complex... this one was decent.  But a bit bland, with none of the richness and depth that I'm used to.  It was more like Chicken Campbell's-tomato-soup Masala.\n\nChicken Mantra - It tasted.... thin...  Like a watered down version of what it was meant to be.  The flavor was actually decent, but once again lacked richness and depth.  \n\nThe rice was a disappointment, and a previous Yelper's comment about it being a \""mouse sized portion\"" wasn't too far off the mark.

So I am a little picky. \n\nWe started of with a Samosa - the pasty was light and flaky, very good, however the filling left much to be desired. I have never had a samosa that had shredded (think hash browns) potatoes inside of it. The traditional is a mashed potato and the hash browns were not very pleasant. However the tamarind and hari chutney were very good. \n\nFor entrees we had the Aloo Gobi Masala and the Chilly Chicken. The Masala dish was not inedible but was not a traditional masala or even one of the many variations that I have tasted. First of all it was very yellow because way too much turmeric was put into it. Secondly there was no underlying masala flavor or cumin that could be detected. It was just a bunch of turmeric, yogurt and garlic. It was edible but not what I would have called a Masala dish. \n\nThe Chilly Chicken was good but again not what I expected. This dish was more an Indonesian or Chinese style cooking and appeared to be flavored with Sambal Oelek. Like I said the dish was good, but not very Indian in nature. \n\nThe garlic naan needed help, the base naan itself was good, but tossing raw garlic that had been sitting in lemon juice or some other sort of acid was not good. Plus it appeared to have a small sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on it - strange. If one wishes to top it with something why not the more traditional chopped cilantro. \n\nThe mango Lassi was served with ice (usually only done when it's very hot) and the Masala chai was good. \n\nAfter the failure at Udipi and now this rather under-par experience I am beginning to wonder if the burgh has any good Indian places to eat.",0.0,0.9979323148727416

My date got the Chilly Chicken and his mouth was on fire, but he said it was very good. I got the Veg Kofta, which were kind of like little falafels in a nice sauce.

For most Indian restaurants, the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori chicken made with ready-made pastes.  With pre-made pastes, it is impossible to get a fantastic Indian meal, it must be made with fresh ingredients, from scratch (even down to making your own cheese).  It got to the point that I could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so I started making it on my own at home.  Just like Mexican food, the best stuff is made at home, not in the restaurants.  \n  \nHowever, the Tandoori Times bistro came along in Scottsdale and I had finally found my culinary nirvana.  Then as if prayers were being answered, Tandoori Times 2 came to Glendale.  Their tandoori chicken is exactly as I remembered it at Modhi Mahal's in Delhi, as is the dal, nan, mattar paneer.  \n  \nI've read a lot of mixed reviews of TT2 here on Yelp ranging from \""beyond bad\"" to exquisite.  I don't understand this, maybe because most Americans don't know what to expect with Indian food because they either think it's native American food or they've never had it in their life before (most Americans already know Mexican food, whether they like it or not).  One thing about food from India, is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years.  Mexican food as we know it (tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc.) is relatively new.  Why is this important to know?  Well, even the rice is different, basmati rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste:  they CARE about what grain of rice they use, it has to be basmati (Uncle Joe's Brown rice just isn't the same, sorry).  This is the feeling I get from TT2, they know what authentic Indian food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial, slap-a-burger-on-the-grill-and-fry-it type of food.  It takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesn't come from canned pastes.  \n  \nThis really shows up in the end result at Tandoori Times 2 and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of India.

The spices have been toned down a bit from food in India but still have kick. One top of that they made me a mini Masala Dosa fresh to order. The filling was delicious but the dosa (lentil flour crepe) was pale and soft not cooked until it was golden and crispy as I like. The flavors were good here. Not outstanding but very good.

We also ordered one of the chaat appetizers. It was unlike anything that I've had before, which is always a great treat because I've had a lot of Indian food. I have only just recently discovered chaat dishes and I've never seen them in a sit down restaurant. Neat!\n\nWe were really happy that the curries came with plentiful rice AND naan bread (you usually have to order bread separately). The atmosphere of the restaurant is really pleasant and a little up-scale. The bathrooms are ehhh, but not awful. The owner came over afterwards to see how we liked the meal, which is always a nice touch. The server was a little new at the job and wasn't able to answer our questions fully. However, she looked like she had just started and needed more time to learn the ropes.\n\nOverall, a really wonderful surprise! One of the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix.",1.0,0.9992285966873168

When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way.  The pappads were awful, stale.  When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, \""Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid.\""  She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer.  Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen.  For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit \""off.\""  Good grief.  Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward.   As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more.  Alas,  everything seemed like reheated leftovers.  Not horrible but certainly not what I expect when I pay someone else to cook for me.\nIt's not every Indian restaurant that serves dishes like dosa, utappam and idlis, so I'm sad to see what could be a good restaurant going down the road to mediocrity.

I'm not sure who was doing the voting or the tallying, but I have to think it was a big mistake... or it was fixed. \n\nI tried a couple of bites of almost everything on the lunch buffet, 4 or 5 different veggie options (I tried every veggie option they had) and 2 different chicken dishes (Tika Masala and Curry). All dishes except 1 (one of the veggie options, I don't remember which) was bland and needed salt. Mind you, I've NEVER once before used salt at an Indian restaurant. Here, everything needed it. \n\nThe only saving grace for this place was the garlic naan and the desserts - the minced carrots with sugar and cheese was tasty and different. \n\nThe service was less than mediocre - had to ask for my drink twice and the bill twice. \n\nSafe to say that I will NOT be returning.",0.0,0.9924284815788268

Found our table but as usual with any given buffet, arse didn't hit the chair before I was schlopping food onto my plate. Dhal, channa, chicken curry, aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala (out when I was at the buffet, but they filled it up pretty quick after), meat and pea samosas, potato pakoras, and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from. Flung a few ribbons of raita Jackson Pollock-like (or Ron Jeremy-like, depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine. Out came some garlic naan (better than regular naan!) which was thin and fresh. Making good on the promise of the initial smell, the food was VERY flavorful. Best buffet I've been to. The chicken curry was actually SPICY, not dumbed down. Why the hell does this place have to be ~40 miles from my house? One thing's for sure, I'll be back. Maybe not for a while, but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian food aficionado that tries it. Word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that's you, I suggest getting your feet wet at Bombay Spice (Tatum and Shea) first before trying this joint.

This is very traditional from the Mysore area in India, where my mother's side of the family hails from.  The dosai was very similar to what I would eat in India, though a bit more elaborate\n\n2) My wife, who is Vietnamese by background, ordered the Spinach Dosai.  She said it was good, as she is used to South Indian food.  I never really did see spinach dosai in India before though.  \n\nRegardless, if a person is adventurous, and you are not expecting the standard North Indian Mughlai fare, this place is worth going to.  I would go back. The atmosphere is more like a fast food, or cafeteria, but the food is good.\n\nI do not want to compare it to elsewhere, as even I would say other places I have lived in the USA, including Chicago, have South Indian restaurants that can perhaps compete with this place and win.

First- and I love this, because I'm lazy- you can make your reservation on Yelp.  Literally three clicks and I had a reservation for four at seven.

And the rice pudding- deeelish!  The only thing that I wouldn't rave about was the Masala chai tea, and that's just because I like my chai blend with a little more punch, and this had quite a bit of milk in it.  \n\nThe ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening, a place to take your folks when they're visiting and you want to prove you're All Grown Up, or an upscale but not crazy-expensive girls' night out.",1.0,0.997307538986206

Interesting but not bad. I ordered a vegetarian rice dish as I'm not a meat eater, with peas, tomatoes, onions, and Indian cheese. It was fairly basic and bland and although you get a healthy portion it seems pricey for what it is at $11. I sampled a bit of everyone's dishes and (again my tastebuds) it wasn't really my thing.

The sambar, idli and gunpowder were on par with spots like Sarvana Bhavan (in America).  The tandoori platter was generously portioned and perfectly seasoned.

For Gandhi, it was our first visit there in December 2005, after a long journey to Montreal. It was late, we were tired and hungry, and worse, indecisive about dinner. But we were rewarded for our choice of Gandhi by wonderful Indian food and, I swear, the best naan I've ever had.\n\nExperiences like that are the bane of diners - we go back trying to repeat them... in my case, trying to have that transcendent naan. I'm not sure it's happened, but in several visits since, we've been nothing but pleased by the delicious Indian food, and the capable, if aloof, service.\n\nYou can accuse restaurants in Old Montreal of offering only bottom-dollar tourist crap, and that charge sticks to a number of establishments. This isn't one of them. I saw one review from a few years ago that described the cuisine as \""British-Indian.\"" It's appropriate for a menu that offers the range of dishes one expects from an Indian restaurant in North America - vindaloos, curries, biranyi, tandoori, bhajis, naan. I don't know true Indian food well enough to quibble about authenticity, but I can say that the flavors, to my palate, are calibrated and nicely balanced - and this seems to be part of the heart and soul of this precise cuisine.\n\nOver a few visits, we came to believe that a request for spicy food would never result in a level of spiciness that we enjoy. But our last two visits in December 2007 convinced us that the kitchen can deliver the spice when called upon.\n\nDesserts here taste pedestrian to me, but after eating as much as I do at Indian restaurants, it could be that I'm all tapped out, so if you've had good desserts here, say so and give some recommendations.\n\nGandhi expanded its space in 2007, approximately doubling the size of the restaurant. One feels less crowded in the dining room now; I've eaten there only once when the restaurant wasn't full or nearly so.\n\nGandhi is worth a visit.",1.0,0.9970830082893372

When it comes to service, I don't come down hard on \""mom and pop\"" establishments that are reasonably priced. Yes it would be nice to make sure we have knives and forks before the food arrives but as long as I can get your attention within a couple of minutes, we're good.\n\nThe quest continues and it seems most Montrealers aren't too discerning when it comes to Indian food but for those with a more discriminating and experienced Indian palate Malhi sweets certainly doesn't rank at the top of the list.\n\nLastly, if you're going to charge me GST and PST when I am paying cash, don't try to get away with not putting it through the register.

The flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness. The portions were great and for the price of $4.99 I think an excellent value (Lunch price is $4.99; regularly $6.99). \n\nThere are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out: They offer deliver and TEXT IN service... so you can actually text them your order for pickup! I think that is such a cool idea. You are texting directly to the husbands phone, and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you.

Dosa do, blates.\n\nHaven't a clue what I'm on about? Then go to Mezbaan and order a dosa or two.\n\nOk so you might not put your faith and dining option based entirely on my review before knowing what you're in for. I went with a mixed group of people; some who had travelled South India and hadn't had a dosa since then, others who hadn't a clue what they were. I've recently learnt that there's a big difference between south and north Indian cooking. Most \""Indian restaurants\"" you get here serve North Indian style - large curries and rice (food baby, food coma, nom but ooft).\n\nSouthern Indian cooking is, first off, a lot spicier and secondly they use a lot more bread and pancake-like ingredients rather than rice. Such as dosas: lentil and rice pancakes, stuffed with all sorts of delicious fillings. (see uploaded photo)\n\nFor want of another way to describe it, think crepes.They're kinda like that, but not. And the ones we got were considered SMALL. Apparently they can come twice as big.\n\nSo, they're tasty. Really tasty and much lighter than the traditional curry. And at Mezbaan anyway, they're cheap! \u00a33 for a dosa? With a side of mango chutney (home-made and delicious) and some veg curry? And twice as filling as a sandwich that would cost probably a few quid more? Yes please.\n\nI had the mushroom one that was nom. Everyone else had a masala dosa, made with potato and there wasn't a crumb left. And someone had the lamb dosa which was personally my favourite, with some really fresh, fragrant sweet basil. Totally getting that next time.\n\nI also got to taste both the mango lassi and the almon and saffron lassi. The almond and saffron lassi came decorated with little strands of saffron that turned it yellow on top. It was certainly an acquired taste, as it wasnt too sweet, but did the perfect job at neutralising the spice. \n\nThe main menu looked interesting too. Smaller tapas dishes with things like honey chicken (never seen before on an Indian menu). I think dosas might be one of my new favourite things, and rather than the odd dosa-thrown-in-for-good-measure that other Indian restaurnats might too, Mezbaan specialise in them. \n\nSo, in summary, dosa do.",0.0,0.9789668321609496

They could make a killing!  We've waited so long!  So disappointed!\n\nI stopped by earlier in the day to review the menu since I was in the area, and happily found they had pani poori and chaat and other non-standard fare - pretty much the only nice, sit-down restaurant in all of Las Vegas that serves Pani Poori AFAIK.. but I digress.  \n\nWell I convinced my SO to go down there and give them a shot.  We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! \n\nAhh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  \n\nTough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.\n\nThe full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nI wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.  She wont even take this stuff to work.  She'd rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal.  *sigh*.  Such high hopes!\n\nSorry Taza.  Please, learn how to cook the chicken?

The naan wasn't too salty and I could really taste the garlic which I enjoyed as well.\nOverall, I wasn't crazy about the place and also not raving about it either.

Its a joke to call this place 'Indian Spices' because of thier bland, flavourless food which doesnt do any justice to making good Indian food with good spices and flavor.. (By spices I dont necessrally mean spicy and hot, I just mean flavours). It should instead be called 'Indian Spiceless' From our experience, I can tell these guys dont know whats Indian food and how to cook it.. \n\nWe ordered navaratan kurma and veg jalfrizi.. Though technically these are entirely different dishes with kurma being somewhat on the sweeter side and jalfrizi being on the tangy and spicy side..  What we got was nowhere near what we expected. Both the curries looked uninspiring and not that different at all.  Both clearly had the more or less the same well cut frozen veggies you get in super markets and more or less tasted the same..  Jalfrizi which typically has more sauce (gravy) was very dry (never seen it in any other Indian restaurant like that) and had virtually no flavour.. it seemed like some spices were tossed in here and there..  And to add to the insult, they prepared these wonderful exotic delicacies taking more than one hour to prepare when hardly there were any customers around!! \n\nNot only do the staff seem to not know how to cook Indian food, they also dont seem to know much about whats Indian food!   My wife had ordered 'Onion Kulcha' without seeing the menu.. (For beginners Kulcha is slightly different type of Indian bread like Nan..) Actually that item was not in the menu.. thats fine.. but instead of telling us that, the staff took the order and brought us 'Onion Nan'.. when my wife complained that this is NOT kulcha but nan, then the staff tells us 'Onion kulcha is Onion Nan right??!!'..  LOL!   Actually this was not a big thing, but clearly shows that the staff (eventhough they looked like Indians) didnt know much abt Indian cuisine.. I then explained to the staff whats the difference between nan and kulcha.. then to make things more comic, we could hear them arguing inside the kitchen abt this issue.:P  \n\nAlso the mango lassie was sour..  We came here seeing four star reviews, thier buffet might be good as most reviewers have opined here or most of thier guests are newbies who havent experienced real Indian food.. When we left the place, we were joking about the name 'Indian Spices' for all the flavorless food with no 'real spices' and exlaimed we could have done this food ourselves very easilyat home..",0.0,0.9997335076332092

I was even more encouraged when I walked in and found an almost exclusively Indian (appearing) clientele.  To begin, the service was a little off.  There was maybe 10 people in the restaurant yet we waited a full five minutes or so for a greeting.  When he did come by, he asked if we were ready to order and I looked at him and said, \""You know, we might need to look at the menus first.\""  Perhaps he's used to \""regulars.\""  Anyway, we began with the Onion Bhaji, essentially an Indian version of onion rings, and Raita, a cucumber, potato, mint and yogurt sauce.  The Onion Bhaji looked good in all its fried glory, but was so heavily battered my wife and I both felt ill after trying a few pieces.  You could not taste the onion at all.  Major disaster.  The waiter began to redeem himself by noticing that we had hardly touched it and offered to take it off the menu.  The Raita was fresh and flavorful but didn't exactly fit with anything we ordered and a recommendation of what to eat it with would have been helpful.  We also ordered the Naan and simply put it was killer---hot, light, wonderful.  First score at Tandoori TImes.  My wife ordered the Chicken Makhani and one sampling of the sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich, buttery flavor.  Nothing to say here again but killer.  I ordered the Lamb Korma, and though I found the dish to be decent, it was just very plain when compared to other Indian dishes I have had that just burst with varied bold flavors.  I also asked that it come spicy (6 out of 10) but instead it came with NO spice at all, while my wife's dish came pretty hot and was supposed to be mild.  I wouldn't order again but it may be right up someone else's alley.  FInally, we ordered a plate of rice to accompany our meals.  The rice looked and tasted like it had been sitting around since yesterday (and maybe it was!).  My wife grew up on rice and loves it more than she loves me, so when she frowns at the sight and scowls at the taste of the rice, it is bad rice.  I could justify giving Tandoori Times less than three stars but something tells me another visit may render us happier customers.

If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor, try the Tandoor Fish wrap!

Living in Laveen, there are not a ton of indian places to visit, unless you want to take a little trip! The BF and I were looking for something different, something we don't normally have. After a little bit of yelping, we found this place. Neither one of us have had indian food, and yelpers seemed to like here, so we thought we'd give it a shot! Although Urban Spoon gives completely opposite reviews, we decide, eh why not?? I'm super glad we braved it out, because everything was real good. The BF asked what my favorite dish was, and I didn't have an immediate response to this question, one bit. \n\nFood was great, I really liked the flavors. Everything we ordered seemed to be tomato based as everything had a redish color. I don't know if this is typical indian food or not, but it could be. Anytime the BF and I try something out, we normally order 3-4 things to try out and of course end up taking a bunch home, but I think it's only fair to us, and to the restaurant in order for us all to get a feel for each other. I wish I had a pen and pad so I can say what we had, but I'll try to describe as much as possible. \n\nWe had a lamb dish that was served in a tomato sauce with potatoes, and I ended up calling this my favorite. Come to think of it this is actually the only one I didn't know. I know it was in the Lamb section of the menu towards the bottom. Then we went with the Chicken Something Masala (they have a regular masala, and we went with the one with 3 words, haha), it was very good too, little bit oily, and the chicken to me was very dry, almost flakey. Then we went with the Beef Curry just in case we didn't like the other too, this dish was real good too. We ordered this with a side of rice, which was fantastic! I loved the rice, its basamati rice, was very fluffy and light. I loved that the rice didn't take over my whole meal and fill me up before I could enjoy each dish (sauce, is more what i'd call it, considering you really need the rice) \n\nAll in all, we'll definitely go back here, I guess until we actually try another indian spot on our way home from work or something. The place is small, they had cute plates, a little bar, that seems as if it will grow if the people come! I can see upgrading the stars with time, and experience!...oh yeah, those 3 things, plus the rice came to just under $35, so definitely sweet on the pocket!",1.0,0.9942725896835328

Both times I've eaten here, I placed a takeout order for dinner (no experience with the buffet).   Like so many of the quality restaurants in the Valley, Sutra is tucked away in a strip mall, behind a McDonalds and doesn't jump out at you.  The food has been incredible both times (this time I took Rahul's advice and tried the Chicken Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer...awesome).  My first visit was several months back and my fiance and I ordered two different chicken curry dishes (can't remember which, but they were both delicious).  I will say that the naan wasn't the best I've ever had, but that's honestly the only thing that wasn't above average.  I'll update my review if I ever decide to try the buffet or dine-in, but I have yet to be disappointed.  Before I close though, I must offer one last comment.  I've never experienced such a personable and polite staff, particularly with to-go orders.  On my first visit, I was helped by an elder woman and the second time by a younger gent, who I think was her son.  They both independently asked me if I had been in before and both sent me away with a sweet rice pudding for dessert, free of charge.  I'll definitely be back...I just hope the West Valley citizens frequent this restaurant enough to keep them in business because like I mentioned, it's an easy place to miss, and if you like Indian food, you don't want to lose Sutra!",1.0,0.99662446975708

The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it. Service was a bit slow, plates weren't cleared as fast as I would've liked them to be, and my water glass was parched a few times but I'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went.

It is an All You Can Eat Indian buffet with all sorts of Indian dishes for just $10.99.  Believe me when this very reasonable price of $10.99 is worth way more than the price you pay. Each time I've been here for lunch it's been packed with people spilling out while waiting for tables to free up.  There's even not a lot of parking.  Most of the time these are good signs of how delicious a place is and this was the case here. Is it authentic Indian? I wouldn't know but a few of my vo-workers from India like them too, though I haven't seen others from India dine here at the same time as me.\n\nI never asked what a dish was or what's inside so all I can say is that I enjoyed them all, the green stuff, the orange stuff, the yellow and brown stuff, the stuffed bread stuff, and the fried battered stuff, all very delicious. They were labeled but I don't remember what each was because I usually sample them all. There was a red chicken, not to be mistaken for char sui, and another meat dish. Ask for the Garlic Naan, the freshest right out of the oven?? the better.  They do have non-buffet options.\n\nIt use to be a Burger King so imagine that kind of space on the inside and they have a TV playing films from India. Customer service is usually fast and friendly so the only reason that I think there's a long wait is because they are very good and those there first are enjoying the goods.",0.0,0.708052396774292

I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE FOR DINNER***\n\nWow, I was a little surprised.   I had heard so many good things.  Perhaps this was just an \""off\"" day for their lunch buffet.\n\nLet me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.\n\nThat said... \n\nI have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didn't know exactly what to expect.\n\nThe service was barely there and the lunch buffet (about an hour and a half into service) was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being \""refilled\"" instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nThe tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked. \n\nThe items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations I've had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.   \n\nThere are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... *sigh* ...go.",1.0,0.823032021522522

I am pretty stuffed and satisfied everytime after dining here.  The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music.  \n\nThe usual dishes we order are: \n - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker (don't know the name of it - sorry)\n - main dishes : tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry (rogan josh)\n - sides: garlic naan and rice\n\nThe appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce.  All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level \""3\"" and they are delish.  Maybe \""5\"" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.  \n\nThis place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.  The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait.  Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix!!  I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food.",1.0,0.997615933418274

I sat down and shortly after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order. The papadum and sauces just weren't good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned. I shouldn't have overlooked this but I did because I was craving Indian food. I ordered two mango lassi's, garlic naan, malai kofta, chicken makhani their speciality, and basmati rice. The mango lassi's were brought out instantly. This one was not made well, was overly sweet, tasted artificial, and was not thick enough. I was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back. I asked the Asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no. Then our Indian waiter comes over laughs and says Mango Lassi's our supposed to be sweet and I said I know I have had my a Mango Lassi before but but this overly sweet, he begrudgingly took it back. \n\nOur entrees come and the portions are huge. Both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded me of curry at a food court. The chicken in the chicken makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly. The veggie balls in the malai kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside. The garlic naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean. \n\nThe Indian food here is mediocre and I question how well things are cleaned.",0.0,0.9983830451965332

I came here after a quick glance at the reviews here - so I was optimistic. \n\nWe arrived late - only two other tables occupied, so I realize I was pushing my luck on 'fresh cooked' ... we stuck to basics.  The papadums arrived and they were good - 4 stars for this .... not freshly cooked, but crispy and not oily.  We ordered the chicken tandoori, a paratha bread, and some appetizers. The appetizers were dry and powdery but let's just ignore those. The paratha bread looked freshly prepared, and had a decent texture, but tasted like it has been cooked in oil that had been used and abused way too much (I'm all for tasty oil ... this was just weird). The taste was awful.  But the Tandoori chicken was the worst.  The chicken arrived with 'stuff' piled on top of it - tomatoes, onions, some kind of 'sauce' I guess - so the chicken was all goopy and wet, not the texture you expect for something supposedly taken straight out of a super-hot oven.  My guess is, they didn't want to fire up the tandoori oven, so just microwaved a bunch of chicken pieces and dumped some stuff on top.  \n\nI drove all the way from Scottsdale at 9pm on a Friday night for this ... :(\n\nI was born / raised in England, and now reside primarily in the Bay Area (home to many Indians!) so I feel like I know what a good Indian meal should taste like!",0.0,0.9958541393280028

The restaurant is located in the Commercial Center right next to Lotus of Siam.  We were reassured to find the place packed full of hungry eaters, mostly of Indian descent (We later found out that most of the diners were from a tour group).  We were a bit worried about how we were going to score a table.  Luckily, there was one empty table to be found near the end of the buffet line.\n\nThe food looked and smelled incredible.  I was starving, but I had to wait in line.  There was so much to choose from for this $8.99 lunch buffet.  I just followed suit and placed whatever everybody else ahead of me was grabbing:  I couldn't stop dipping my hot buttery naan into the green chutney.  It was tangy with a minty finish.  I also enjoyed heaps of my favorite Saag Paneer (creamy spinach with chunks of cheese).  Usually, at buffets, I find the Saag Paneer to be dried out, but here it was very wet.  For meat, I really liked the goat curry.  The meat was pungent and very tender.  The sauce was tasty and spicy and compliment well with the rice.   The dish that I did not enjoy was the chicken curry.  Those pieces of chicken breast was so dry, even though they were submerged in all that curry sauce.\n\nThis is great place to go for an Indian lunch buffet.  We will definitely be back.

Everything is done properly, the rotis, idlys, the chana masala, the chicken curries, the raita, etc. There's usually 2 meat curries and 4 veg curries to choose from. Fresh salad (cucumbers to plonk into the raita) and fresh fruit for dessert.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, know that this isn't gourmet Indian or out-of-the-box Indian. It's just plain average mama's Indian. Which to me, is perfect for a quick lunch. It's also tons better then overpriced Indian, or sad discolored Indian food.

When we informed our waiter, he assured us he would be able to accommodate this. He went to the kitchen and came back to tell us that several dishes could be prepared dairy free and that he would take care of it. In the meantime, we trusted this and sat drinking our beers. 30 minutes later, another mysterious waiter tells us that actually only two dishes can be made without butter because almost everything at this restaurant is pre-made and sitting in the kitchen already (probably under heat lamps.) Had we known when we first sat down that they wouldn't be able to serve us a meal we would enjoy, we would have just left and understood --but by the time we were informed of their culinary incompetence, we were so starving and most other restaurants had closed- so we decided to see what they would prepare for us. What a mistake! We would have been better off leaving hungry.\n\nNeedless to say, the service was horrendous- the waitstaff we encountered were a bunch of incompetent fools without a sense of professional hierarchy or really a manager at the restaurant to oversee at all. One random waiter emerged after the other- none of them consistently understanding our requests or giving us what we ordered. When the food did finally arrive, it all tasted the same- a slough of mush covered up with shallow turmeric/tomato/garam masala flavoring (probably from a packet.) When we expressed our disappointment and frustration, the waitstaff was at first mildly apologetic then we saw them laughing at us behind the bar. When our bill arrived there were several errors that had to be accounted for- when I asked to speak to a manager, two different waiters pointed to other random waiters which clearly weren't supervisors so we never had the chance to address our experience at this establishment.\n\n\nWe will NEVER return, our stomachs ache and our wallets hurt. Mother India is a JOKE and is truly the kind of place that gringos that know nothing about Indian food eat at. It is also not a place you can eat at and trust- I assure you, even if you don't care about dairy in your food, what they are making in the kitchen isn't fresh- you would be much better off at your corner Indian deli.

Whenever I see a menu claiming to be Nepalese I always feel a bit cheated to see familiar things like Biryani and Tikka Massala on there, but apparently the difference between the two is that traditional Indian dishes are much creamier and coconut-based, whereas Nepalese is based around tomatoes and lentils.\n\nThat's one of the things that's so good about The Ghurka - you go for a curry but don't leave feeling like that girl in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory who swells up into a giant blueberry and has to be rolled out of the room. \n\nWe went for lunch, where you have the choice of the \u00e1 la carte or their \u00a35.95 Set Menu.

When the waiter set the plate in front of me with 2 huge ones on it, I thought I was never even going to get close to finishing them both myself. I did.\n\nI can't review this place without mentioning this one thing though: on the lunch menu, although you have a choice of loads of different meats/fish/prawns, and you can choose the spice level, it's still just described as \""chicken curry\"" or \""lamb curry\"" etc. It doesn't exactly give off the most exciting impression of the food, although when it came we did all agree it was delicious.\n\nAlso, this is an ideal place to go for a chilled out, relaxed meal.

The chicken didn't taste super-fresh, either, so it might have been cooked and rewarmed.\n\nAs for the service, it mainly consisted of about 10 people milling around the small dining room, refilling water, asking how the meal was, and being confused about what went where. \n\nI'm still looking for a great Indian place in the valley, but I've had much better food at Royal Taj in Tempe and Star of India in Ahwatukee.",0.0,0.9985291957855223

My biryani was fantastic--fragrant, flavorful, whatever you may be looking for in a biryani was in it.  The curry was pretty bland.  Others have commented on how spicy food at Mintt is, so I'm wondering if you actually have to say you want it spicy to get it spicy--otherwise you get the \""adjusted for the Pittsburgh palate\"" level of spice.\n\nStill, an excellent meal.

I was given the crappiest of the place to sit although the restaurant was all empty, well I moved to a different place, no big deal. To start with the appetizers, Tandoori chicken was soo bad, it was awfully greasy, bland and tasteless. The pakoda was disgusting. Okay, no big deal, may be the chef had a bad day.

He comes to my table to clear the food, and takes my plate in his hand clears all the scrap from the plate right beside the table into his cleaning basket with his knee on my opposite chair. I was like, wtf!?? I felt disgusted. You dont have to be a huge hotelier to understand such fundemental aspects of a waiting job. At one point I was working as a waiter and I never would do that. Now the ambience: they basically play crappy, cheesy indian dance and sing routines from the 70's and 80's and that too in full volme.

The waiter asked how spicy (mild, medium, spicy) and I said medium. When the food game, it looked nice, but there was very little flavor and no spiciness I could detect. It wasn't horrible, but I've enjoyed Indian food in mall food courts more than the food at Taj Palace.\n\nThe service started off great (four waiters taking care of the two of us), but we were oddly left for 20 minutes after we'd finished out food with not a waiter in sight.\n\nAlso the booths were rickety! They don't seem to be attached to the walls, so I could feel every time the person behind me moved. It's difficult to describe this annoyance without sounding ridiculously petty, but I spent most of the meal leaning forward at an unnatural angle.\n\nI really wanted this place to be good (not least as I'd talked my girlfriend out of her favorite Thai place that's in the same strip mall). A curry and beer on a Friday night ... the stuff (Englishmen's) dreams are made of! Maybe the lunch buffet is great, and that why this place has great reviews.

The Paneer Pakoras were fresh and fluffy, but lacked flavor or spice.  The sauce for the Tikka Masala was okay, but no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks of chicken.  The spice level was pretty good, but if you like spicy Indian food, you better order something higher than a 5 because a 5 is the equivalent of mild (in my opinion).  The Curry was tender, but just okay.  Nothing much to report on that.\n\nMy biggest problem with this place is the price.  The Naan and Rice are an additional $8.50, not to mention the fact that each entree item is about $15 a piece.  Yes, you get a lot of food, but that's standard at any Indian restaurant.

The fam and I decided to give this place a try, even though it is very far from home, but with a recommendation like DDD, what could go wrong?  Well, first off, it's a bit chaotic when you walk in.  No real system to be seated and the tables are weirdly situated.  Once we were seated we were rushed to order... thankfully we mostly knew what we wanted.\n\nI tryed the marsala fries, which were BY FAR the best thing we ate.  Those, I must say are amazing.  I also had a bite of the samosas, which were ok... not really that favorful, and the chicken tikka masala.  Honestly, it was ok, but I've had better... even from Trader Joes.  We also had the goat... this too was ok... better than the masala, but so fatty it was hard to eat.\n\nSo, long story short... if you live near here then perhaps hit it up.  Otherwise, check out some Indian food closer to home... that is my recommendation.  You're welcome.",0.0,0.9968597888946532

I've had Indian/Pakistani food all over the country and this did not stand up to the hype on Food Network.  I've been there 3 times and have had the Chicken Tikka (featured), the Tikka Masala, and the Aloo Saag.  The Chicken Tikka was great, but the other two were the exact same dishes you'd find at any average Indian restaurant.  The food has also been luke-warm every single time, like it had been sitting for about 10 minutes before being brought out.  Food-wise this comes nowhere near the really good Indian places I've been...it's not bad, but not great either.\n\nNow onto the service, which is where most of this review score comes from.  The customer service is TERRIBLE.  Everyone working there acts like they have no idea what's going on, like this is their first time in a restaurant and they don't know how it works.  My party of two had to wait for 15 minutes before being seated and there were only 2 other families in there.  They gave us literally 10 seconds to look at the menu before very briskly asking for our order, and then looking offended when we said we needed more time.  The food took WAY too long (and like I said felt like it had just been sitting), and the check took even longer.  We didn't have a consistent waiter, different people kept coming over to us and I really got the impression that they don't have any type of consistent system for waiting on their guests.  In general, everyone working there acts like they don't care that you came in and are deciding to spend your money there.  It makes me not want to come back.  CURRY CORNER: if you are reading this, go hire a consultant to come in and show you how to run a restaurant.  You really really need some help with this.\n\nThe restaurant itself is shabby and the tables and booths are arranged really awkwardly.  It's not particularly clean or festive looking and the fish tank is really really dirty.  I could see into the kitchen and that didn't look very clean either.  There is no music playing and it makes it way too quiet and awkward in there.  \n\nSadly, I don't agree with Guy Fieri on this one.

I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables taken. That should have been my warning to leave, but no... I said I will give it a try based on Triple D. \n\nI pay for my order and head back to my hotel. No issue with service, I only walked in and picked up my order.

The Masala sauce is very loose, almost like they used skim milk vs heavy cream. So I opened the container of rice to add to it and I took a bite... no seasoning. Just bland white rice. No flavor of cumin, clove or cardamom, not even salt. I taste Tikka Masala sauce and it wasn't good, almost seemed like they left some important spices out.\n\nI then proceeded to open the soup container of Matar Paneer. This was loose as well. I am really getting frustrated now. I take a spoon and search for the peas and a chunk of the Paneer (homemade cheese). Instead of Paneer, it tasted and had the mouth feel of tofu. Very disappointed. I closed up the containers of Chicken Tiki Masala, Matar Paneer, and rice and threw them straight into the trash. \n\nThe only thing that was good was the cheese naan.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, in fact in my opinion, it is a disgrace to Indian Food. \n\nI have ate at one other Indian restaurant; Indian Place (Indian Delhi Palace - http://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-delhi-palace-phoenix?hrid=vLH0tzET4aC02gSgEAWkMw) in the Phoenix area, and I should have just went back there.",0.0,0.9997351765632628

They were in a different location for many years just down the street where they offered some of the best Indian food in Montr\u00e9al.

There is no other establishment in our fair city that can boast the authenticity and flair for genuine South Indian cuisine as they can, period. I'm assuming you've tasted the deep soul-searching and reaffirming soft yet crisp taste of a masala dosa -- and if you haven't ! get thee to the nunnery and make it snappy. Believe you, me ... if I could buy masala dosas on a street corner in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve; sold in a plastic ziplock baggie, then cook it up on a spoon with a zippo underneath and shoot that sweet Shabu-shabu right up into my veins, I would, oh yes I would. But I think that'd be a tad bit unsafe so in between my methadone fixes I go to Thanjai where I eat to my heart's content. The chilli garlic masala is my dosa of choice but please please do peruse their extensive dosa menu. You'll be in dosa heaven.

Yesterday they had chicken tikka masala, goat curry and tandoor chicken for the meat choices, and dal, a spicy potato dish, cauliflower and mutter paneer for veggie options.

Some of the items looked a little old (like it had been sitting in the warming tray a while), but the items I tasted were warm and tasted fine. It's worth noting that the tandoori chicken and chili chicken were pretty tasty. I was a little disappointed that they did not have chicken curry, which is what I usually order. The waiter was friendly and came by to pick up my plates each time I got up to go back to the buffet and also refilled my water when it ran low. He also brought me a basket of naan during my meal that was warm and tasted fresh.\n\nThe restaurant itself was decorated nicely, although it felt a bit warm and stuffy while I was eating. Perhaps they  need to turn on the a/c? Just a thought. Also service is slow because they only have 1 waiter during lunch, who also doubles at the host/greeter. But this really wasn't a problem until it came time for me to pay because there were only 4 tables seated while I was there. I was never brought a check, and just handed the waiter a $20 bill and asked to pay for my meal.

The parking lot does get filled because a combination of India Masala, the various business around, and the small parking lot. I'm impressed with the interior, it is very nice and a huge improvement from what was there, only a few years ago.  That being said it is very nice inside but how does the rest stack up?\n\nWell I came here with my usual large group of co-workers and they were more than accomendating.  We all did the lunch buffet which was only $9.99, the same price as Mt. Everest.  In comparison buffet wise, I do perfer Mt. Everest a lot more because they had more selection, flavor, and better quality in the non-salad and non-dessert items but India Masala is an ok substitute. So they don't have a large selection on their buffet. Their rice dish wasn't mixed well, large patches of non-mixed rice was found throughout. The curry dishes were very running, if they weren't meant to be running. But their desserts, the free mango lassi after check-in and yogurt/tapioca/pudding looking things with fruits were all very delicious. Their meat dishes and regular/garlic naans were about the same. Customer service was excellent, when a few of us decided to use our free lassi check-in offers and they gave more than enough it became awesome.\n\nThere are better Indian restaurants in the area. The food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of. Maybe I'll come back for dinner or not do the buffet.

Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. \n\nThe spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. \n\nThe Naan is great, I admit.

I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!\n\nSaag - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. \n\nKheer -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. \n\nWe ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. \n\nRestaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).\n\nOverall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! \n\nP.S.

Fair enough.\nOnce we were seated, the waiter came right away and brought the menu. Four of us chose one different dish so we could try four different meals. We had quite a variety of meals: naan garlic, fish vandaloo, chicken curry, shrimp curry, lamb biryani as the main courses. Samosa and lentil soup for appetizers. For the drinks, we had mango lassie and chai. Was a good experience! The price is reasonable too! We'll be back!",1.0,0.999425768852234

The food was fresh and tasty, and the concept of tapas-style Indian food was a novel concept for me. The place was buzzing and it felt like I'd been temporarily transported from the bitter cold of Edinburgh to a Bollywood film set in Mumbai. So I was quite excited to return for a second visit. Alas, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nOn my second trip, we made the mistake of not booking beforehand and so had to wait for a while (15 mins) before a table was free. We were asked to take a seat in a little room off the main restaurant, where there was another couple waiting. Unfortunately, more people were invited into the room and it became a bit claustrophobic, however we were offered water and menus whilst we waited. \n\nWe were shown to our table, one of the canteen-style long benches. And then it was as if we were forgotten about. No-one came to take our order, and it was only after I signalled to one of the waiters that we were given attention. I got the impression that there were a few senior staff who were stressed at having to manage the less experienced staff. There seemed to be a lot of staff running around, which does on one hand add to the street-food experience the restaurant is trying to offer, but came across as being a bit disorganised. \n\nTuk Tuk operates on the basis of first-cooked, first-served, so our dishes trickled out over the course of ten minutes. Unfortunately, they forgot about the mango lassi I ordered and I only received this nearer the end of the meal. We also had to remind staff about our Indian 'snack pot' that never arrived. \n\nThe food itself, though, is great. The butter chicken I ordered trumped any prior tikka massala I've tried and the Chicken 69 (basically chicken nuggets in a sweet sauce) was pretty tasty. My selection of vegetable pakoras were pretty good too. The mango lassi was worth the wait. My only complaint food-wise was that the rice portions are a bit conservative (or maybe that's just compared to the load of rice normally served in takeaways). \n\nOverall, we were \u00a320 each for around 9 dishes, 2 rice and a naan (and those Indian snacks).

The gentleman who seated us made sure we had fresh rice for our left overs and brought over some foil for our bread.  Our tea glasses never went empty.

It opened in March and I went about 6 times in 4 weeks, as my first review of it attests. I got chatting to the waiter, and learned that the chef was from South India and had been a South Indian chef for a number of years.\n\nThe food that was presented over the last 6 months at The Cholas was beautiful. Chana Masala chocked full of chickpeas. Chicken curries so delicately and intricately spiced. Paratha bread that was melt in the mouth delicious. Dosas that were crispy, and filled with flavouful potato or lamb.\n\nBut in the last 3 months, the food quality has reduced quite a lot, and in such ways that I can point out what has changed. The chana masala has about 1/2 has many chickpeas as it used to, and is far more a 'sauce' with some floating chickpeas in it. Before it used to be made up of almost purely stewed, soft chickpeas. The dosa once came (home delivery) with a lamb filling that had NO flavour or spice. They must have forgotten to add any spices, but it was tasteless. The chicken curries taste like standard \""UK Indian\"" creamy, spicy curries but with no distinct flavour. The paratha is thicker, heavier, less buttery and fresh, and just not as great. The aubergine curry also has less aubergine in it. \n\nThis used to be a restaurant that offered what many Indian restaurants in Edinburgh couldn't. Excellent Indian food, authentically cooked and spiced, with beautiful ingredients, good portion sizes with very unique dishes. The waiting time in the restaurant was lengthy, and the interior of the restaurant is also very 'lacking' and plain, but it was worth it for the delicious food.\n\nNow, the restaurant is still lacking in decor, the waiting time is still very long, and the food quality has reduced so much that I don't want to spend 30 minutes waiting for it and really don't know if I'll go back. I've ordered (both sit in and takeaway) 5 times from them since I noticed the change in quality, each time hoping the last was a fluke. But no, it seems to be permanent.\n\nThis is almost like a break up. I'm sorry Cholas. You still serve totally 'a-ok' South Indian food. But it certainly isn't any different or special to anything else served in Edinburgh, and you used to have something that no one could imitate. Such a shame.",0.0,0.9960086345672609

Sitara has the best reviews on Yelp and I even ordered a lot of food to try and get a variety of different things.\n\nI had the mixed grill which is Malai, Tikka, Garlic and Tandoori Chicken, and also comes with a lamb seekh kabob. I also got the Paneer Pakoras and the yellow Dol and rice which came with the meal.\n\nAlmost all of the chicken were in boneless chunks, with the exception of 2 wings, which I believe were the Tandoori. They were all pretty dry and almost similar to each other. Maybe this is because they are grilled rather than fried? Maybe I'm just used to heavily breaded chicken? I'm not sure. I did like the flavor of the Tikka(?) though, it was a little sweet and spicy. The lamb kabab was a little more flavorful and better in consistency but still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. \n\nNow, the rice that came with my entr\u00e9e was surprisingly good for being just basmati rice. I was also given what felt like at least a pound of it, so no shortage there. The yellow Dol is not something I ever had before, but that I did like. It had a really interesting herbal flavor to it and can most closely be described as a soup.\n\nI also got an appetizer of Paneer Pakoras which I'd say are similar to a mozzarella stick but not as greasy and heavy. These were good but by the time I had gotten around to eating them were inevitably cold. They were unusually tasty and came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a VERY spicy green sauce and I'm not sure about the other one, possibly a sweet berry sauce. Either way these sauces were delicious and I ended up dipping my chicken in them.\n\nOverall the portion to price ratio was pretty good, although I wasn't very happy about how expensive my meal was considering I didn't much care for the chicken which was most of my dinner.\n\nDelivery speed was really quick probably about 30 minutes but I actually think the delivery was the reason I didn't enjoy my food. Often times with delivery things sit around and get overcooked in the process. I think if I am ever to try Sitara, or any Indian food again, I will definitely go into the actual restaurant. From the pictures I've looked at, most Indian food looks very moist and saucy which is what I was hoping mine would be, but it was kind of dry.",0.0,0.9575616717338562

My mango lassi was made in a blender at the bar so I could hear it being made from where I was sitting. The mango lassi was icy and tasted watered down. This was the first non creamy mango lassi I have had. \n\nThe samosa filling was well seasoned, not too greasy, but breading was a tad thick. It took 45 minutes for my vegetable thali to come. I am used to Indian restaurants being abnormally fast. \n\nThe presentation of the thali was classy and each dish tasted freshly made. My favorites were the malai kofta and the Kashmir sabji, the rest I could have done without. The malai kofta was well executed and the creaminess of the curry and aromatic spices worked harmoniously. First time I have had the Kashmir sabji and the assorted vegetables seasoned with herbs and spices pairs well with the richness of the malai kofta.  \n\nAll the food I had was thoughtfully prepared and freshly made. Hari seems to genuinely care about his customers. After finding out i didn't like my mango lassi he made me another one without the ice. I hope they work on getting the food out in a more timely manner because I do not know anyone that wants to wait almost an hour for Indian food.",1.0,0.9936176538467408

The decor was very old world, almost colonial with chandeliers and dark wood, and no flocked wallpaper in sight.

The sauce with the paneer was judged the favorite, creamy and not overpowering flavor. The jalfrezi had a nice flavor, but possibly had a little too much curry paste for my taste.  There were plenty of peppers and onions to give it a nice crunchy texture. My major complaint was that every piece of chicken contained gristle which was a bit awkward as my dining companion, the delectable Kristina, does not look kindly upon people who take gristle from their mouths and place it on the side of the plate.  Apparently one is supposed to surreptitiously spit it out into a handkerchief when no one is looking. Anyway, I had no handkerchief, so....\n\nThe lamb was not as spicy hot as Kristina likes it, but she was brought up in Thailand so her heat senses were somewhat numbed when she was a child.  She thought there was too much potato vs. lamb, but still enjoyed it.   We did ask for some accompanying chutney, but they apparently don't have that available.  We had some good home made lime pickle instead.\n\nWe had some carrot halwa for desert, but it seemed rather old and dried up, and had clearly been warmed up in the microwave.\n\nOverall we had a reasonably good although not outstanding meal, but did feel it was a little expensive, about $12.50 per dish, with rice another $2.50, so would have certainly preferred better quality chicken.

We ordered the medium spice level to be on the safe side on our first visit. The garlic naan was delicious and I really enjoyed the rice.

Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course. \nThe Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it. \nThe food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink. \nFinally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant! \n\nThe food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was \""closing\"". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done. \n10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the \""courtesy\"" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust! \n\nThe food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!",0.0,0.9923248291015624

I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans.

I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.\nChicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish.

It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. \nLamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. \n\nOverall - the service was not good.

It was my second time a Tandoori Times, although this location was a new one. Its actually kind of tough to find... tucked away in a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants.\n\nWe sat down and were greeted by a very nice waiter. We both ordered an Indian beer and asked for suggestions. He pointed a few out and we got to ordering.\n\nAppetizer was a Lamb Kabob (but they take out the stick before it is served). Just ground lamb with some saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers. It was accompanied by a few sauces. It was ok but certainly nothing earth shattering.\n\nThen we ordered two entrees he recommended. One was a shrimp dish with a reddish curry. The other was chicken vindaloo. Pretty much chicken with potatoes in a yellowish curry.\n\nHe also suggested we get some nan (a flat bread) and some rice, advising the dishes were family style.\n\nHope I don't sound to crabby, but the portions were crap. I was expecting it to be like a Chinese restaurant where you get a good portion to share. NOPE. The shrimp dish had a whopping 6 shrimp. For $14 bucks I expected much more than that, especially after teh family style/sharing comment. If I go to a Chinese place and get spicy shrimp they bring out a proper portion. \n\nSame with the chicken. Maybe 6 or 8 chunks of chicken with a little potatoes. Same story as above. Anywhere else and I'd get a mountain of chicken. Enough to share, right?!\n\nThe little bit of lamb was $13, plus they also charged for the nan and rice. $3 bucks each.\nAnyway, the food was definitely good, but when accompanied by a $67 bill (plus $13 tip), this was probably the smallest $80 meal I've had. Both my client and I could have eaten much more if allowed.\n\nSo I guess to sum it up. Good food but not at its price point. Those things have to line up to get a glowing review from this Yelper.\n\nHighly recommend it though if price isn't a big concern. Can't wait to have to explain to my boss why I'm expensing an $80 lunch for just me and one client at an Indian joint.",0.0,0.9974638223648072
