So blissful!\n\nMy facial had no extractions or un-natural chemicals applied to it. It was all about nourishing the skin. It's reassuring to know that you're going to walk into a facial and come out with soft supple skin - rather than a face full of red marks and peeling. I would definitely come to La Pomponee again - for a relaxing day full of epic massage and good vibes.\n\nIf you're looking for more vigorous facial and want more pronounced results - you may want to look elsewhere. For simple natural glowing skin though - La Pomponee is the way to go.\n\nTrust.",1.0,0.998879849910736

Although you may call a specific location, that location might not be the one that answers the phone, so from the get-go, we had a bit of scheduling confusion.  I had perused the services menu online prior to calling, and had selected the Fresh Face Facial.  As I scheduled my appointment, the receptionist mentioned that it was typically for teenagers, but given that I felt this was best for my needs, she booked it for me anyway, no questions asked.\n\nWhen I showed up, I was pleasantly greeted and quickly ushered back to the waiting room, where I was asked if I wanted anything to drink (from reading other Yelp reviews, apparently they have wine?).  The chairs were comfy, the lighting moodful, and there were a few magazines to read while passing the time.  Once I was called back to my room, it got awkward.  Apparently the service I'd booked was ONLY available for teenagers, although neither the website nor the receptionist indicated this restriction when I booked my appointment.  The aesthetician and I played an awkward cat and mouse game as she tried to upsell me to another facial.  Given that price was one of the factors I'd used in not only selecting my facial choice, but also one of the reasons I'd chosen Modern over another spa, I was a bit peeved.  My face is the same size as a teenager, and I'm breaking out like it's the mid-90s all over again, so I don't see why there should be a $15 upcharge (which she told me was the standard price difference between the Fresh Face Facial for teenagers and the comparable offering for adults).  Finally, she said that since I hadn't been told this during the reservation, they would honor the appointment as scheduled.  Nice outcome, but making your clients uncomfortable from the get-go is not the best customer service experience.\n\nWe began the facial, and I told her I had been having some skin problems over the last few months.  Instead of generally asking me what products I use, she immediately said \""do you use Aveda products?\""  Here, we go - informercial central; time to sell some product.  Luckily that was the only sales push I got, but again - an impact to the customer experience.\n\nOnce we got over those hurdles, it was actually a very pleasant experience.  My aesthetician was easy to talk to, and what she did felt great on my face.  Ultimately, I was pleased with the service (product-related) I received but felt there were some challenges with how the service (customer-focused) was delivered.  Not sure if or when I will return.",0.0,0.979162871837616

We were able to have lunch and do a little shopping together prior to our facials, so that worked out really well.\n\nWe both enjoyed our \""EA Essential Facials.\""  My esthetician was Christine and my mom's was Alina.  They both seemed knowledgeable and professional and had a fair amount of experience.  As with most facials, they also recommended some products for us, and we did end up making a few purchases as well.\n\nIt's worth noting that I made our appointments last week and we did not get confirmation phone calls.  We also were not told exactly where they were located and hence wandered up via a back entrance, which was very shady.  If you're reading this, note that you'll want to enter via the Royal Coffee - next door to The Capital Grill, and then head upstairs via the stairs or elevator from there.  I shared this feedback with one of the staff members working at the front desk, but she didn't seem to be interested.\n\nSo, while the facials themselves were fine, the overall experience was dampened a bit due to the fact that the ladies working up front were not the friendliest or interested in my feedback.  It's also just as pricey as the local resort spas but the facility does not compare.  If you're looking for a full spa experience, I'd head elsewhere, but if you are just about a service or two and the Biltmore is convenient for you, this may be your spot... pamper it up!",0.0,0.991170048713684

I read the description of the facial the groupon was promoting, which was the ultimate deep pore facial, and purchased it. Since my husband and I both still have iffy skin we thought this would be perfect for us. Making appointments was a little bit of a hassle, just because of how many groupons were sold and the dates we were able to schedule. We ultimately made appointments for late September on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe day of our appointment we showed up about fifteen minutes early so we could both fill out some paperwork regarding our skin. While the fact that this Spa is in a strip mall like location doesn't bother me as much as some reviews I have read on other sites, the waiting area sort of does. There were not enough places to sit and there was a large group of women waiting for other services when we showed up. My husband ended up standing till we were called into the back. There is a little sitting area for those getting facials in the back, which is nice since its secluded from the rest of the Spa. \n\nSuzanne though, is the friendliest facialist I have ever met, hands down. She was open, warm and welcoming. She asked if I had any issues with my skin I needed addressed and asked all the right questions. It didn't feel weird that I didn't talk to her that much during my facial like it has with others. I am one of those people who like to zone out during a facial and talk makes it less enjoyable. My husband is the opposite. He likes to talk and him and Suzanne talked throughout his entire facial. Each of us had a different experience based on our skin types. I had a pumpkin mask and my husband had another kind. Both of us were really happy with our experience. The only issue I did end up having was I ended up really red for the next couple of days. I might have more sensitive skin than I realized and it ended up being almost like a sun burn, with peeling and everything. \n\nAs we were leaving, Suzanne even gave us a discount to come back before the end of the year. I don't know that we will be able to get back before then, but I will definitely come back to have Suzanne do another of my facials. She was great. The rest of the staff is friendly as well.

That was until \nlivingsocial offered me a great price on a facial. \n\nLikes: \nThe place is huge and very nice on the inside. The receptionist was top notch and very pleasant. The Spa area was clean, quiet and serene, just what I personally love and seek out during my spa visits. My Aesthetician was WONDERFUL, she gave me spot on helpful advice regarding my skin and even recommended producs and facials that would work best for me. The best part of that is that she explained in depth why each product would work for me. It wasnt a blind pushy sale, which I always appreciate. \n\nDislikes: \nAs per spa etiquette I arrived early to check and be prepared for my facial and yet, my aesthetician started late. Which, late is always a bad thing but when she still finished my appointment at the expected time I felt slightly short changed. Also she talked the ENTIRE time during my facial. Thats personally a little pet peeve of mine because im there to relax, not necessarily chat but to each its own I guess. \nThe price I paid for the facial was spot on for a cleansing/basic facial and was actually a little surprised that they charge more. There was not special products or techniques used, I was a little shocked only because a basic facial should cost less than a specialized facial but here that isn't the case. \nFor these reasons I deducted a couple of points. Im not sure if I will return to this place, Im pretty satisfied with the spa I go to know and the prices are a little better.",1.0,0.9832315444946288

Every where you go online you see her amazing reviews.. and it is for GOOD reason! She is exceptional and worth the wait in getting an appointment (you have to book a few weeks ahead). \n\nOnce you become a member of her \""club\"" you get discounts on her products and her services. I try and go once per month. I never knew what dermaplaning was and it's a really great thing. You should definitely try it.\n\nI had acne when I was younger and have some scars from it and in general have never felt the best about my skin. After seeing Jennifer about 8 times last year I have found my skin to look SO much better.\n\nJennifer will ask you questions about your make-up and face care and she's super realistic. When I explained I've been wearing mac for years many would probably think she would tell me to stop wearing that because it is heavier. However since we've found it doesn't irritate my skin it's A OK with her. It's those type of personalized conversations she has with you on each visit that help the process to go faster. She also sells skin care products that work so well. The facial cleanser (milk one) is amazing and I try and use my \""Jennifer in a bottle\"" acid almost every night. \n\nI am 27 and serious about preventing aging and I think going to Jennifer is a great way to keep that goal on track. She's also very sweet and wonderful to talk to. I leave Jennifer with better skin and a better peace of mind with whatever is going on in my life. She doesn't charge for that service but she probably should. :)\n\nI usually get the mix of a facial, extraction, dermaplane then microderm and top it all off with a cherry.. no actually you get a chemical peel at the end. About 5 days later you'll have lost the top layer of skin and you will look absolutely fabulous darling. You look great the next day too but after you peel is when you really see it. It's a hard hitting combo that works. \n\nShe's also a great person to talk to about filler and botox although she doesn't do that herself. Her recommendation for botox is awesome although I haven't gotten it yet if I do I would only go to her. Her name is April.\n\nTotally awesome experience and the only person I'll ever go to for my skin. She gives you results and is very affordable.",1.0,0.998767614364624

This facility is 5 star for sure. Loved the women's spa lounge staff and front desk staff to death. The 2 stars comes from the worst facial I've ever had. I'll keep her name private, but it did start with a J.  I was greeted and brought into the treatment room. She asked what products I used but that was it, no real consultation (like I was told when I booked the appointment I would have).  She then chatted about this and that, told me \""sorry if you hear me fidgeting a lot, I have a bad back and it's spasming today.\"" Uh-oh, that's not the best start. Long story short: there was so much downtime with nothing going on but me sitting there. The steamer was on, but no steam actually touched my face. The hand and foot massage that was talked about in the service description was a lotion application and light very very short rub at best. She noticed I had eyelash extensions, any estheticians knows to not manipulate eyelids let alone ones with extensions. I lost half of them on my right eye by the end. She applied some lip balm/hydrator to my lips where a huge chunk made it into my mouth, not pleasant......my co-worker  received the exact same service with another provider and absolutely LOVED it. So I know it wasn't a bogus service but just a disappointing provider. Look, this is a nice resort where people drop a lot of money, spa services are not cheap here. I'm actually fine with paying high prices for amazing service because I believe in service value.  I was so unhappy after my service I asked my coworker to leave with me instead of staying and enjoying the amenities bc I was so upset.  Redeeming factor: at check out impolitely asked if a manager was available and the professional gentleman behind the desk informed me that they weren't buy asked if her could help me. I explained my situation (very calmly and politely as I'm not a usual complainer.) and he was immediately apologetic and comped my service. He was amazing I wish I remembered his name ( I think Allen but I'm not sure) He is the epitome of customer service.  The resort itself is lovely.  I will write a separate review for BLT restaurant bc that was a most memorable experience.  Go to the spa it's great, I just hope they recognize their providers should give their all.

I called lots of places on a Sunday morning, and this was the only place that could fit me in at the last minute.\n\nMy daughter was having some breakouts, and I thought a facial would serve her well.  I immediately became a member because I thought the $59 membership would \""force\"" me to get out and do something for myself.  (Although I have not been a stay at home mom for 9 years, I am still accustomed to not spending much money on myself.)\n\nMy daughter's face cleared up quickly.  I followed up with some express facials, but eventually I signed her up for monthly facials as well because her skin only stayed clear with consistent facials.  I currently have both daughters (14 and 16) getting monthly facials.  \n\nThe place is clean and very welcoming.  I never had regular facials before coming to Fuchsia.  I had one facial at Dolce salon.  It was nice, but I thought the people were snotty.\n\nI later had a second facial and massage at JC Penny salon.  It was also nice.  However, when I went back for my second appointment, I waited for 20 minutes before leaving.\n\nSo mostly the facials I have had have been at Fuchsia.  From what I remember of the other places, Fuchsia's prices were much better and the quality was better as well.  \n\nNever once did I feel pressured to get memberships for my daughters.  Most of the ladies there do not pressure you to buy products either.  Some of the products are expensive, but Eminence products last a really long time and are worth it.  \n\nWe started to get pedicures at Fuchsia to last year after my daughter got an infection in her toe after getting a pedicure at a \""hole in the wall\"" place.  The cost for pedicures is a little more at Fuchsia, but the infection on my daughter's foot taught me to not be so cheap in that area.\n\nFuchsia is a great place, and I am so happy with the service we've gotten.  They're flexible and are great when we have to make a change in appointments due to my daughter's busy school schedules.   \n\nMy girls still have some breakouts at times, but regular facials and extractions have really helped their skin and confidence with their appearance.\n\n**After being a member for quite some time, we finally cancelled last summer when we had problems scheduling.  Once the receptionist scheduled us on the day of a big event and when we showed up the day before for facials, manicures, and pedicures, she told me that we were scheduled for the following day.  That happened twice.  Then they could not coordinate three of us together without one of us waiting, so it became a hassle with scheduling.",1.0,0.8931335806846619

Wanted a towel, no towels anywhere, asked and no one restocked!  Not even next to the showers!  Booked a massage and facial....massage was sub standard ( had better at massage envy!! ). The facial is what spurred me to write this review. Before I got on the table for the facial, I requested that the aesthetician needed to avoid my just placed fake eyelashes. Certain facial products melt the glue. Had to ask twice to cover my eyes with pads but she didn't. Kept saying \"" after this next step\"". I also added a collagen mask to my treatment. I've had the mask before knowing I had to wait 10 minutes for it to work. She applied the mask and the left the room. No massaging my shoulders or hands and arms. She left for approximately 20 minutes. She removed the mask and the slopped on the finishing products as fast as she could. Needless to say after the appointment was done, I had a ton of product on my fake eyelashes. (Those of you who don't know, it takes about 1 1/2 hours to glue individual lashes to each of my lashes. )  It looked like I had the worst mascara brush and my lashes were all clumped together. I paid for facial products that now I had to wash OFF!!  Which I did wash off hoping my lashes would NOT fall off!  I complained about my service but all they wanted was the money.  Three days later 90% of my lashes were gone.  It would have been less expensive to pay regular price at the Four Seasons Spa then to go to this horrible place.  BEWARE!!

She massaged my face and shoulders for maybe 5-7 min with the aveda stuff that is supposed to open the pores. I really didnt think much about it since i just finished my massage with Cece but if i was just getting a facial, i expect at least a 10 min massage while the mask is setting instead of being left alone. At the spa I used to work for you would get an arm, foot, shoulder and scalp massage for the same price and the esthetician never left your side for the 50 min she was with you.. (Food for thought Management)  Another observation I made, I could hardly feel the steam at all. I even had to look up every so often to see if it was on.. Not sure if this is because the room was so cold or what.. \n\nAll in all, the stars are for Cece and her massage:) if I could give her 5 stars, I totally would..",0.0,0.7232390642166138

The esthetician was friendly and informative, though she didn't really explain any of what/why she was putting on my skin during the facial. Maybe that's not standard practice, but I like to know what is going on. Afterward, she did give me a face chart that listed some of the products that I may want to purchase (...at those prices, fat chance). She did a few extractions and concentrate on some of the more problem areas, which I appreciated.\n\nThe spa itself is a bit outdated. It seemed clean enough, but the whirlpool was small and the tiles around it were cracked and worn, the steam room was a boring, white, ugly room, and the bathroom looked like high school. The staff was super friendly and I appreciated the hot coffee/tea/juices available. \n\nAll in all, while the facial was a nice pampering, I was very glad I did not pay full price.

This is huge for me since I don't have a water softener at the moment. Saunatox is just as what you would imagine but the lights used give a euphoric feeling that I'm sure you will be given the technical version once you get there or you can read about it on their website.

Honestly I was getting really desperate for anything to make a difference and I am so glad I found Milunka. She took her time to understand what was going on with my skin and also took her time during the facial to extract a lot of gunk, it definitely wasn't a comfortable process but considering she is pretty easy on your skin and she really knows how to go after the stuff deep in the pore that causes all the problems. she was also very considerate in managing the amount of discomfort I was in and regularly asked if I needed a break. I even splurged for a new skincare regimen because she was really admit that it would work. I was worried it would be too drying because on the surface my skin is normal to dry and harsh products usually just make me itchy and the inflammation worse but so far her products are working great. My skins not clear yet but its a good start and hopefully in time Milunka will help me achieve a beautiful clear complexion.",1.0,0.990174412727356

If this says anything, I would continue going to Jennifer even if she charged twice what she charges, and with that said her services are VERY reasonably priced considering the results you get. \nI've also been waxed by her and it's not the in-and-out type of experience that you get at a typical place. Oh, and sorry for rambling about her amazing-ness, but she also has topnotch products for sale, all-natural, fragrance free, legitimate products that make a huge difference in day to day use. If you want a genuine esthetician that knows her stuff, you need to go see her, your skin will thank you and you will not be disappointed.",1.0,0.9963467717170716

Not only is she highly professional and very knowledgeable about what she's doing, she's also the sweetest, kindest, and most caring skin expert I've ever been to. She treats you as though you're her best friend, and unlike other facial spas I've been to, the service does not at all feel rushed. During the 90 minutes I spent in her super cozy and relaxing spa room, I felt that I already got to know Summer, and I had a really good time with lots of interesting conversation topics. \nShe also prioritized my wellness over her potential to make money, and gave me advice for where to buy cheap, but high quality, skin care products. Despite her not at all trying to push her own products on me, I really wanted to try them, and I purchased one of her kits. After my first treatment with Summer, I could see clear improvements in my skin, and the products that I bought from her have helped maintain these results. My skin now got a nice glow, and the acne cleared up. The line that had started to appear in my forehead is also no longer visible, a magic that previous facial treatments weren't able to perform. I can't wait to go back! It's just as nice as going out for a cup of coffee with a good friend, and you get to improve your skin drastically in the process of doing so. Summer also offers very reasonable prices, less than half of what you would pay for the same treatment elsewhere in the city (and less than a third of what I would have to pay in New York), but the quality is even better than what I've experienced at competitors. I can wholeheartedly recommend Summer for the next time you go get your facial treatment, and you won't regret checking out her business!",1.0,0.9991196990013124

You can totally tell the differences before and after the treatments. Needless to say, She is very professional and definitely knows what she is doing.  \n\nNot only that she always makes me feel like I'm her daughter lol like She takes the time and care to make me feel beautiful inside and out and always makes me feel as if It's all about ME :) She listens you, and understand what will work for your skin type and condition.\nOver all I'm very satisfied with my results, and am thankful for her caring and skillful service.
