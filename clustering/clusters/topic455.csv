I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said, last night's performance -aside from the scrumptious food- was not acceptable.\n\nI went with a group of ~15 people to Mama Ricotta's for a Christmas function. I was one of the people that voted to have the event at the restaurant because I've had such great experiences in the past. I know a larger party requires patience on both ends and that mistakes are inevitable, but we had quite a few... our drink orders were mixed up repeatedly. One person ordered a salad with romaine lettuce and it came out with iceburg. The servers kept placing the wrong meals with the wrong individuals, which I know is hard not to do with a big group -but it added to our frustration. We did all get our food, but none of the dishes came out at the same time, so several people's food was cold by the time the final entree came out. \n\nThe real fun started with the checks. Given the issues we had getting the right entree/drink to the right person, we knew the bills were going to be a nightmare -and they were. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our bills straightened out. By the time I actually received my bill (which was about 10 minutes after everyone else had paid and was leaving the restaurant) it was incorrect. I notified the server that my glass of Pinot Grigio was not on the ticket, he asked if that was a red wine. I know you only have to be 18 to serve alcohol, but it's important for servers to know which wines are white and which are red for customer service purposes. The server tried again with the ticket, which I had to go to the hostess stand to get, and it still did not have a glass of wine on it. Because I needed to leave I spoke to the manager, who was very nice and told me just to pay for my entree... but he kind of made me feel like I was making a stink to get my wine comped -which was not the case.\n\nWill I try Mama Ricotta's again? Yes, but never again will I go back with a large group & I'll make sure not to order wine next time.",0.0,0.9995152950286864

Duck is out of  this world.\n\nMade a note to come back in 2009; which we did over labor day weekend.

Turns out that that week they had 3 menus on display: The std, the $7$7$7-$45 lounge menu and one week only \""Special\"" that was offered in many Vegas restaurants.  I asked if we can sit in the lounge and was walked over to some low profile couches and coffee tables. I said I wanted to sit in the lounge area that had normal tables; was told by the hostess that its called the Garden Lounge (ok, whatever) and the 777 menu is not offered there.  I told her I do not care, as I am here for dinner and asked if the $45 menu is available and she said YES.  We proceeded to sit down and wait 10 minutes for someone to walk up.  The LONE waitress was taking care of a large table and no one else was working there.  A guy in a suit came by and poured water. After another 5-7min and when the waitress went from the large table to a register to punch in orders,etc bypassing even a courtesy stop at our table: I went to the front to find out what the heck is going on.  The same guy started walking back with me; which at that point the waitress was at the table.  As I walked up, my wife said that they are not offering the $45 menu, as the \""weekly\"" special menu was in effect.  Now at this point, I am pissed since I could have had that answered when we first sat down.  We would have also sat in the main dining room if the $45 menu was suspended in the lounge . Front desk gave a wrong answer and the waitress was not attentive.  So I walked out!  Now again, if the duck was not available on the $45 menu; I would have ordered of the regular menu; but I want to receive prompt service and accurate info; which was not the case here!\nWill stop by again when we are back in Vegas, but will skip the whole lounge BS and just eat in the main restaurant.\nP.S.: Spoke to the Mgr, who turned out to be the young kid in the suit.

I just wanted French toast :'(\n\nThere's only one reason to be in this human sized doll house...The frozen hot chocolate. It's absolutely delicious and fun to share.\n\nHowever, if it's good food you want, or a glimmer of a menial smile, you're better off going somewhere else. \n\nIt was tough watching my Reuben sizzle in the window for literally 11 minutes. I wanted to grab it, because the OH had a flight to catch, but I didn't want to be 'that guy'. We became the 'waiters', instead of the patrons.\n\nSkip Serendipity 3 if you can.

Would have given this restaurant 4 stars if not for the terrible service from our waiter Roberto. \nHe seemed to be completely preoccupied with the couple at the table next to us. After our entrees were cleared and we declined dessert, we waited over 15 minutes for our check before we waved down a passing busboy and asked him to send Roberto to our table. Rather than coming himself, he sent the busboy with the check even though Roberto visited the table right next to us about 5 times after our plates were cleared. We were not rude to him in any way, shape or form so I can't imagine why he chose to behave that way. He came by to say sorry as we were signing the check. Too bad because the food and atmosphere were nice and it would have been a pleasant experience if he had made the slightest effort.",0.0,0.9982582926750184

Sunday night, and decided that I could not live with out boneless buffalo wings. Since Cogburns ( formerly Payton's Place) is in the hood; why not stop by. Walked through the door and all of three people there. None of them employee's. Waited with my family about 7 minutes until a patron feels bad and try's to give me a menu and seat me. Respectfully, I decline and started to the door. As I opened the door to leave, two employees, one male the other female, come from the kitchen looking at me surprised as if not expecting to work that night. As they pleaded for my family and I to return, all I could think about is how \""not\"" busy in the kitchen they were while preparing no ones food. Just saying'! Since opening night the service in this place sucked. Can't say anything about the food because I was never able to get any!",0.0,0.9995595812797546

As a friend said to me, the thing about Mongolian Grill places is you cannot blame the cook! - granted it does help if you have an ideas of what ingredients go well together, but BiDi's - like other places - does give you recipe cards, and there are people around to give you help.\n\nEverything in there is fresh and there is an very big selection of ingredients, so it may take you a few tries but once you have an idea of what you like it is fun.\n\nThey make you wait while they cook and I have seen things back up as a result - To compare with another Mongolian Chain - Genghis Grill - GG gives you a card and delivers to your table, which I think is a little better. Also you are dependent on your waiter(ess) for your Starch - and that can mean waiting if you run out, or just want something different.\n\nIf you like the Monogolian Grill concept, this is definitely a good execution and I recommend it.\n\nFood - 4 stars - Service by the Greeters knocks it down to 3 - but I will go back, everyone is at least friendly\n\nTip :-  If you have not been before, go at lunchtime - its a little cheaper and the only difference is they do not have steak available as a protein.

Our server only had one table (ours) and completely disappointed us. We ordered a couple of beers and took about 10-15 minutes to get them to our table. Then we ordered the snack size wings for me and the buffalo grilled cheese for my husband. When we got our food (which took longer than should have for only being about 5 tables in the entire restaurant) I noticed that I only had 4 wings in my basket when the menu specifically says \""at least 5\"" for the snack size. So I asked the server politely about it, because I understand it's not always the servers fault. He responded saying \""on really? Well the number changes every week.\""... Then why does your menu say \""at least 5\""? He then told me he would get me another one. As for my husbands food, it was cold right off the bat, and only had a few small pieces of chicken. Time went by and we finished eating what we had. Our server brought our bill and I never did receive that last wing. Pretty disappointing service for being his only table. I can only image what he's like with a full section. I wouldn't have minded if he had just told me that they were out of wings for the night (if that were the case) by laziness doesn't fly in my book. \n\nPs. I gave this place 2 stars because it was the nicest bww I've been in so far. But that's not all you need to make a good restaurant. Hire some hard workers, Buffalo!",0.0,0.9986681938171388
