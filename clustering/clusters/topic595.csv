The horrid 90's revamp of a 50's diner with pig kitsch look of the place makes it impossible for me to take it seriously or to feel ok about eating there but we have had take out a few times.   The sides are really, meh, you are better off going across the street to \""Sprouts\"" grocery and buying their potato salad and slaw and whatever else you like there to have with your smoked meat.  Their meat is really basic.  If you buy Guy Fierei's bottled sauce at the grocery store and you buy all of your sides at the grocery store and then get some smoked meat from Thee Pitts you can have a relatively unremarkable but not terrible meal.  I prefer the smoked stuff from Bobby Q and from Rudy's, sadly Rudy's is all the way in Chandler but when I want smoked meat either I smoke it myself or I drive to Chandler anymore.",0.0,0.9707596898078918

You can tell which one is Schwartz's by spotting the line of excited tourists lined up down the block for a chance to get a seat! The meat (I get mine full-fat, not lean) is juicy and smoky and greasy and tastes amazing with a massive pickle and yellow mustard. Everything you could want from a smoked meat. But personally, I will not wait 30 mins for it-- I usually go to the Schwartz's STORE which is right next door to the restaurant and order mine as take-away.\nMy honest opinion: Schwartz's smoked meat is really delicious, but not that much more delicious than the smoked meat at le Main across the street!
