I really do. I like supporting local companies when I can, and you don't get much more local than five miles from home. They've also got an overwhelming variety of (theoretically) mouthwatering flavors. They donate tons of bread to local charities. The factory store has crazy insane prices on bread.\n\nBut the bread? You know, the only thing they make and sell?\n\nIt sucks.\n\nIt used to be great. But now they're selling these teeny tiny baby loaves for real loaf prices, and literally nine times out of the last ten (I am a patient, forgiving man) they're gummy, underdone, undermixed, or some combination of the three. I don't feel like playing bread roulette at the outlet prices, much less at the $4 they go for at a grocer.",0.0,0.9811109900474548

If their delivery that day didn't include the bread advertised on the sandwich board, you'll have to settle for something else.  In my experience, the worst day to go is Monday, when their perishable ingredients have been sitting over the weekend and the help is too busy running around to stop and make anything fresh.\n\nI'm guessing friends of the employees/owners are responsible for many of the glowing 5-star reviews.

Since moving into Melrose, this store is walking distance from my home. How I lived without shopping here I'll never figure out. This store quickly became my go-to, all was right and good. Five stars all the way.\n\nBut then, something changed. It wasn't the news of corporate doom, no, but I bet that's why. Something changed in the store -- and it's why this is not a five-star review. That something is fresh bread. Seriously, F&E are you kidding anyone with this \""new\"" formula of bread you're peddling? \n\nF&E's fresh baked bread was among the best bread I had ever eaten, and certainly tops for grocery store bakery fare. The price was amazing, and the crusty, just right kind of chewy carb heaven was sublime. The bread was a starring attraction that led me to other purchases. I'd go in for bread, and come out with with half the store.\n\nNow ... sigh. This \""new\"" bread is a disaster. I was hopeful when it rolled out in store that it was a test, a mistake, a joke ... but alas it's still there. The new bread is too doughy, lacks crust, the flavor is off. Lowering product quality, while raising the price, is an insult. I'm really surprised no one else has complained about this -- which makes me wonder if this change is not universal. If that is so, I'm going to be very angry. \n\nIf anything, I'm guessing this quality change was made as a cost savings. This is a great example of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Tracking my spending in this store, there's a sharp decline since the bread has changed. I certainly can't be the only customer in this camp. \n\nUm, slow clap for crappy business decisions, like shaving costs at the expense of profits?
