Haven't been for the past 5 years or so, decided to re-visit some old school charm! No sooner were we seated that we were asked what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to order. I had to explain we were in no hurry to order dinner, wanted a drink first. While waiting for our one drink and bottle of wine, two more servers appeared to ask for our order.  Finally we gave in, not even 1/2 way through our drinks. Caesar salad still served tableside, server overdid the oil so all you tasted was oil. Ordered the filet, medium rare, was served to me raw+, sent it back and within seconds (no time whatsoever) to cook was served to me again and yep, raw, couldn't even cut it with a knife. Seriously? The best steakhouse in Las Vegas...not anymore. Decided not to chance a 3rd time. The baked potato was a baked potato. The b\u00e9arnaise that was served with the first filet, sat there and got cold while someone in the kitchen attempted to cook the filet to medium rare.  The veal parmesan was adequate. Nothing special so much sauce you couldn't see the veal. They did remove the filet from our check and offered dessert but by that time we were so aggravated we paid our bill and left. Nothing like it used to be with the exception of the restaurant itself. Lastly, they need to get some servers who speak English. Don't bother, go to CUT inside the Palazzo.",0.0,0.990635335445404

I had raved to my folks after the last time, they went and had a dismal experience. I had to go back and see if there was any redemption to be had.\n\nWe bought a pitcher of frozen margaritas. Not a good idea, being frozen and all. We  tried to pour it and it inundated (it will almost all pour out in one mass!) the tiny glasses we were given, making for a sloppy mess. The mess was made and our sorry waiter (he wasn't sorry for it, he was just a sorry waiter) just throws a couple of towels on the table, doesn't even bother to help, and wanders off. (It was not even busy! More on him later!)  The margaritas were very, very weak. Not much flavor at all. It was so frozen that you easily got brain-freeze. What made matters worse was that we were given straws that are the equivalent of coffee stirrers to drink out of.\n\nThe appetizer was potato-skins. The skins themselves were overcooked and greasy at the same time. Innards were decent. \n\nWednesday nights are \""Brewmaster Steak Nights\"", where it's $10.99 for a 9 oz. Steaks were fair, not very flavorful, and A-1 was a definite must. Baked potato was not warm enough to melt the butter or cheese. Fries were so-so. Caesar salads were too \""stalky\"" and there wasn't much flavor from the dressing. Potato soup was once again very good.\n\nOur waiter was a bit absent-minded. He only had 2 tables to wait on and seemed to wander around a lot, not really doing anything. He forgot our waters which was fine because of the amount of water we were ingesting from the quickly-melting pitcher of frozen margaritas that would continually thin out what little flavor it had to begin with. It took awhile to have our order to be taken, Heck, even those nifty little sweet biscuits took a little while to come to our table and we got them as soon as we sat down the last time. Apps, salads, and food were brought out in a timely manner but little things like the A-1 sauce or extra napkins wasn't quick enough. \n\nI'm on the fence about going back. The previous trip with just eating sandwiches and the Pina Colada Milk-Shake was great, but I don't think I would come back for a steak.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter",0.0,0.999225378036499

I can usually tell within 2 minutes if I'm going to have to endure crappy service. But, I usually wind up giving it the benefit of the doubt and I stay. A good indicator of this is when the restaurant is half empty but you still don't get any service for 5-10 minutes, and when you do, the waiter tells you he didn't know you were his table. I really should get in the habit of walking out once my indicators go off. Maybe that will be my New Years Resolution. \nWe went on Sunday night, around 8:30pm. We were seeing \""O\"" at Bellagio at 10:30 and figured it would be a good choice. Food alone, the place is probably 4 stars. The garlic mixture with the bread is quite tasty, my boyfriend enjoyed his caprese salad. The prosciutto wrapped prawns were deliciously salty. My sweetpea ravioli was something totally different and really good. The one miss was my boyfriend's pork roast. Some parts were amazingly delicious, and other parts were dry and inedible. Go figure. \nThe service really brought the place down. Maybe our server had a long and hard day, who knows. We had to ask for bread, he forgot my order, disappeared for ten minutes at a time, forgot my dessert, and had to be flagged down for the check. Somewhat forgivable in a busy place, but again, that wasn't the case. \nOur bill was about $130 for the two of us. 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, no alcohol.

They arrived smothered in vinaigrette dressing.\n\nWell before we had a chance to finish the salads, the entrees hit the table.  If the salads had been worth finishing, that would have meant cold entrees.  We both ordered carne asada tacos.  I've had better tacos at Del Taco (fast food for those unfamiliar with the chain).  The tacos were served with rice and beans, neither of which tasted all that great.  \n\nThe service:  \n\nThe service was clumsy in my opinion.

Poor signage in the casino [Venetian] made finding it difficult [casino directory/maps extremely outdated.] \n\nWe sat outside overlooking the pool area - nice. But problems soon began.  Our server seemed to disappear after salad was served, even though other tables near us received their food and finished before we received our entrees.  It was likely  nearly a 60 min delay between salad and entrees.  \n\nThen the food was not very hot when served.  Maybe the food had been sitting our for the 60 min delay.  I ordered a classic French dish - steak frites - with a flat iron steak.  Granted flat iron isn't the best cut of beef, but when cooked right, can be quite flavorful . It arrived unevenly cooked [well done to medium] even though I had ordered medium rare.  The beef flavor was overpowered by the shallots covering it, which I eventually scraped off.  I was warm, not hot.  I felt especially ripped off that I was charged $36 for a flat tron steak.  A princely sum for a pauper's cut of beef!  My wife's mussels were not very warm either.  The fries were over salted. After waiting so long, I was afraid of another hour wait if I sent it back.  It would have been nice if I had the option, but our waitress [redhead] was ignoring us.\n\nI left a restaurant angry for one of the few times in my life.  Not only was the food disappointing, but the service was poor [except for the stewards who kept our water glasses full.]  It took forever to finally get the check.  \n\nHaving had tasting menus before, I know when a meal should take two hours.  A salad and entree should not have taken 2 hrs.  I tipped the waitress less than my usual 20-25% - I only felt bad that the other servers [bread, water] would suffer for the waitress's poor attention.\n\nI will not return, nor will I recommend anyone eat at Bouchon.

Afterwards she is in conversation w/ the older female hostess (owner? mgr?), and I am watching the woman speaking & gesturing wildly with her hands.  Crap, I'm concerned the waitress in trouble...

My friend recommended the chichen doner, equating it to chicken shawrma, but I still found my self torn between that and the lamb kabob wrap.   \nOrdering the chicken doner with a side salad, my friend decided on the falafel plate.    While it took a bit to get the food out, under any other circumstance time would not have been an issue, but since we had to be somewhere and we were hungry it felt a lot longer than I am sure it was in reality.  \nMy chicken doner was served fresh and  piping hot off the grill  with a side of tzatziki and a spicy tomato based \""salsa\"" and the salad was fresh romaine lettuce, tomatos and cucumbers, drizzled with a rich spicy dressing.    The Chicken doner was seasoned superbly and garnished with pickles and tomatoes.  I enjoyed this much more than the chicken shwarma at Al-Hana.  \nMy friend's falafel plate looked amazing with a salad, 4 or was it 6 good sized pieces of falafel, hummus and some warm pita. \nThe turkish pilsner accompanied the meal well.  \nAfter we were done, the waitress offered hot tea on the house, and had we not had somewhere to be we would have stuck around for some hot tea.  \nThe service here was excellent and the waitress was very friendly. \n\nSo why 3 stars and not 4 or 5.

When we got our food (the wait was fine) they read off the receipt, which I appreciated, while pointing at the boxes of food, then we left with our meal.\n\nWe got home (we don't live far) and started scarfing our food so we could leave in time.

Some people would be annoyed at this, but I haven't eaten meat for many years.  My body can't handle it.  So I was PISSED.  HOW the hell did they manage to put a meat burger in place of a black bean vegetarian burger?!\n\nI immediately got back in my car with the remainder of my meal and drove right back to this place.  I went up to the girl WHO TOOK MY ORDER INITIALLY and told her that she messed up and gave me a meat burger not a vegetarian burger.  She looked at my receipt and said, \""oh, I must have put it in as a black and blue burger instead of a black bean burger.\""  Did she apologize?  NO. She just looks at me and says, \""do you want to talk to a manager?\"" I said of course I did, shocked that she didn't even care enough to apologize.  \n\nThe manager came out and, after I explained to her what happened, she was very shaken and went to the kitchen to tell them about the screw up.  But she never talked to the girl who messed up my order.  The kitchen didn't know because she typed in the wrong order!  \n\nThe manager came back to me with TWO $5 off gift cards.  Not ONCE did anyone offer to refund me for my meal, or even just the burger that I obviously wasn't finishing.  I had to fight for the refund for a few minutes before they agreed to it.

This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been in, no excuses for it being Las Vegas. \n\n1. The waitress was a snob and used hard sell tactics.  She made outragious claims about the food.  She told us \""everything\"" was organic.  Not likely.  She went on to say how the quality of everything was so special that none of us would have every had anything that good.  I have been in the food business for years and was insulted by her implication that we were country bumpkins. When we didn't order the dessert she told us not to get any from the adjascent vendor, cause it had artificial colors and flavors.  WTF.  When she couldn't sell us \""everything\"" she abruptly left and pretty much ignored us for most of the time we were there.\n\n2, There were 6 of us.  (2) couples EACH shared a salad and one entree. The other couple each had a entree, no salad.  No one had dessert and only one person had a drink (a coke).  The bill was 180.00  I could stop here but.........\n\n3. When my husband and I asked for the dressing for the octopus salad to be on the side, she pretty much rebuked us and said it was the best lemon vinaigrette we had ever tasted and we must have it on the salad.  Ok, we did.  Never even tasted it.  The salad was $14.00 and had a couple of pieces of octopus and a couple of pieces of potato.  It was ordinary.\n\n4. My husband and I ordered the Grimalini.  It was so undercooked that I could not eat it.  The waitress overheard me say this and after commenting that I didn't understand what al dente was took it back.  When it finally came back, it was almost the same as it had been.  There was about (3) tablespoons of overcooked dried out sausage and some rapini (not bad).  I did not eat it at all. The bread was aweful and my husband had to ask for oil. \n\n5. My husband's uncle ordered the meat balls and spaghetti.  It was the smallest portion I have ever seen for an entree.  There was a handful of marble sized meat balls???? I can only imagine what they tasted like.\n\n6.  The others didn't complain about their meals.\n\n7. While waiting to go to the ladies room I could see into the kitchen.  There was a large tub of chicken sitting out unrefrigerated.  It was there when we came in and it was there when we left.

Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. \n\nWe made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. \n\nSoon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. \n\nOur burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. \n\nAnother plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! \n\nA third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!\n\nA fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. \n\nLet's work on that self-confidence, shall we?",1.0,0.5019506812095642

Small location in strip mall, which is not a turn off, since we've found excellent food in small, family owned restaurants.  They were not busy, only 4 tables with guests, lunch time, we got there around 1:30.  The server came and took our drink orders, 1 beer, 1 pisco sour and 1 soda.  She returned about 5 minutes later with the beer and soda, no pisco sour; and took our food order. We asked for the yuca huancaina as the appetizer, 2 cevices and 1/4 grilled chicken.  Out came the yuca, a small portion considering the price, but ok. Still no pisco sour...when we asked the waitress, she said the gentleman that makes them had stepped out, but we would get our drink as soon as he came back. 25 minutes passed by before one of the ceviches came, then 5 minutes later the chicken. When the second ceviche was brought out 10 minutes AFTER the chicken (I still don't understand why both ceviches weren't served at the same time), the waitress suggested we get something other than the pisco sour.  When asked what happened, she just stayed quiet. We ordered 2 beers.  \n\nThe portions were adequate, nothing spectacular or to rave about. The portions of the fish pieces for the ceviche were a bit large. Chicken was good, not overcooked, seasoning was alright. Again nothing worth coming back for.\nOur waitress checked with us one time to see how everything was, the next time she came by was with the bill. What a surprise! There was the pisco sour in all it's glory being charged on our bill.  When asked why it had not been removed, she stated that the 2 beers would not be charged, however the 2 beers at $3.50 each should have been $7, not $8. When this was pointed out, her reply was, \""oh, yes, he'll give you back a dollar, when you pay\"".  Really? We asked if the manager was available and was told he only comes in for dinner time.  We texted him a message to the number under the cash register, still have not received a reply.\n\nIf the manager can't trust his staff to make adjustments or corrections on the bills, then he should have an assistant manager during the hours he's not there.  Terrible service, definitely not worth going there.  Much better Peruvian food elsewhere in the valley.\n\nOh, and BTW. The cashier didn't give us the $1 after all.",0.0,0.9867727160453796

The service was timely enough, but the server couldn't answer any of our questions. I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. \""I'm not sure, sorry.\"" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager. Then, when she came back to take our order, the busser walked by and she flat out interrupted my husband in order to tell the busser something, to which he replied that the lady at another table needed a refill. It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. \n\nSo, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched. It's a disappointing way to waste $40, especially when there are so many great places close by.\n\nI would only suggest coming here for a drink before the game if everywhere else is packed and you MUST be right by the gates.",0.0,0.9996354579925536

A wait for a table when the establishment was practically empty, then a long wait for wait staff to approach. We asked for water and my husband ordered a draught beer. After about fifteen minutes of watching the waiter stand at the bar and visit with a couple he clearly knew, I decided to approach and ask for a Coke and my husbands beer. He replied \""we serve Pepsi\"" really curtly because I was interrupting his talk about cars. Then he seemed to try to recover and said \""oh I'll bring your drinks in ten seconds sorry about the wait, it's so busy\"". In the meantime a couple was seated at the table next to us. They asked for waters and menus and never got either so they gave up and left. I'm not sure why we stayed at that point but we were having a good visit and were curious about the food. The bus boy was excellent. He eventually came around with some focaccia bread and brought two Pepsis (not a Pepsi and a draught beer) but whatever. There was no butter or olive oil for the dry bread. The waiter came and took our order. We nibbled on the bread and finished our Pepsi and after about ten minutes the waiter came around to \""clarify, what we'd ordered... so he'd forgotten to place the order. The bus boy offered us more bread and I asked for oil and he gladly brought it. Our meatball appetizer arrived. Here's the really bad part: they were tasty enough, but there was a long black hair in mine. I'd been chewing it and partially swallowed when I started to gag from the tickling. I pulled it out and almost died. I'm really blonde with shoulder length hair... It clearly was not mine. We decided to call t manager over and he was actually really apologetic. The waiter dashed up and joked \""I told them to put the hair in the dessert only tonight!\"" \n\nUgh. The manager offered complimentary food and just about anything he could do to make up for it but it was too little too late, honestly. He offered free food to go or did we want some desserts to take with us but we declined, we were just too turned off by the whole thing at that point. \n\nLater, my husband (who never gets sick and has an iron stomach) said he didn't feel well and he thought the meatballs upset his stomach. I was floored. Since I'd not managed to get a whole meatball down, I was okay, just a little nauseous when I thought about that hair.",0.0,0.9989540576934814

Ok so, we finally made it to him put our name on the list.  They told us about 40 min wait!  Wow!  Come to find out, you can't call and make reservations, not good!  We decided to just order to go.  Well that was still a 40 min. wait.  We ordered the fried chicken appetizer, My husband ordered the Ronin Burger uummmm, they kept the egg though!  I ordered the Crusty Crab, Truffle fries and salt and pepper fries.\n\nI loved the Chicken appetizer, it was so good, but with all the dipping sauces, I wasn't sure what was suppose to go with it.  I did try all of the sauces with the chicken.  Again, not sure which one was suppose to go with the chicken\n\nI loved both fries the truffle one was different, but it was still good.  I really liked the salt and pepper one.  It had jalapenos and cilantro on it,  what a nice touch. \n\nThe Ronin, we ordered well done....we didn't get that, it was medium well!  If that were my burger, I couldn't have eaten it!  When a customer ask for well done, we don't want to see any red!  So due to that I didn't even get to taste it.  My husband was ok with it.  He said it was not bad.  Except he would have also left the coleslaw off. \n\nSo on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one.  It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy.  It was eitable, but I think crispy is better.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.\n\nThe employee's seemed like they were stressed out!  It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night.    I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.\n\nI think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time!

A plate really should make sense...and asking for extra is unnecessary. \n\nFor entrees we had the cold pressed duck and the lamb chops.\n\nThe duck was nicely medium rare, but I usually enjoy a crispy duck skin and this was soggy and bland.\n\nThe lamb was barely edible. The chef recommends medium rare, so this is how I ordered it. It came more than well done. When asked, I did show the waiter (and later the manager) the meat, they saw it was obviously over done. Of course they apologized and offered to re-fire...it was then that I told them of our 1 1/2 hour time limit, and I didn't want to get kicked off of the table!!! \n\nMore apologies, they were very sorry...the manager said she had no idea how the time limit thing happened...but would definitely address the situation.\n\nDessert was ordered, coffee and donuts. This was a little cup of coffee pudding and 3 beignets...Again, I'm puzzled why a dessert ordered for 2 people had 3 beignets, instead of 2, or 4, which would have made much more sense. But, they were delicious.\n\nThe price was above average for Charlotte, and most meals and restaurants in this price range do a much better job.\n\nOverall, the quail was spectacular, other things mediocre, and the lamb just awful.
