I have been out of the country for a year and decided I needed to get my Nando's fix. I used to love this place but now I do not know if I will ever return. The service was terrible. First, the hostess did not know where to seat us. I was confused and she walked us around just as confused until finally deciding on where to put us. Then as we waited for our server we got our chips and salsa from the bus boy. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally, we were asked if we would like anything to drink. I was on the verge of walking out of the restaurant up to that point. I wish I had. After receiving our drink I noticed the server had sat down at a booth to have a conversation with a customer. It appeared he knew him.  I have to admit that my meal was good but my wife ordered a chimichanga that was for some reason, watery. My waiter promptly refilled my soda but at no point did he ever introduce himself or ask us if everything was alright. I felt as if he just wanted us out of there. Then we waited for our bill...and waited...and waited. Finally it arrived and I was so happy to pay because I just wanted to get our of there. Now I sit here wondering if I will ever go back. Perhaps, if I do I will try the other location. I was told that the waiter was training someone but I never saw him interacting with another person as if he was training them. He didn't even offer that as an excuse for his poor performance. Either way, I was sad to see one of my favorite establishments reduced to a place that I do not even want to visit again. So, Nando, I hope that you can get this right. If I ever do return you have a lot of work to convince me to add this establishment to my favorites list again. I hope you can do it because if you do not then you will surely see business leaving for another place that services their customers with a smile and a greeting. A place that shows it cares. A place that shows that we are welcome.",0.0,0.997073769569397

The lobster mashed potatoes weren't spectacular, I've had better at el gaucho. Makes me wonder if the lobster was frozen because we are nowhere near the water here. The Caesar salad needed some citrus, and the dressing was very bland. Even the asparagus was just so so. Our waitress was less attentive than the bathroom attendant! They compensated us by taking the salty steak off the bill and brought dessert at no charge. Unfortunately, the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was curdled.

They serve everything in GIANT bowls and platters that just make it difficult to fit everything on your table.

The explanation given was that the toppings are premixed with the tomatoes. This may have affected my ordering decision and a good server would have mentioned this up front. I can make chicken and lettuce at home. My chicken salad was also lacking much chicken. Before the food even arrived the manager came by the table and asked how things were going.

He immediately shut us down and said it was because if an event at the stadium. I pointed out there is no mention of this policy on the website and the event wasn't for another 2 hours.

I expected cartwheels! I do not know how they are staying in business, with that kind of service. Pretty sad, considering the food is really good. Needless to say, I left no tip!",0.0,0.9985785484313964

I  expect competent staff for the exorbitant prices charged for the food and alcohol. What good is an extensive selection of highly-appraised food and alcohol on an iPad when the staff has little interest or focus to manage it. Sitting at the bar or at a table, the service sucked. I  get it that people make mistakes, but come on if I  wanted a third rate experience I  sure as hell wouldn't come to the Las Vegas Strip, and of the most expensive hotels on the Las Vegas Strip to find it. This is a pathetic example of everything that is wrong with the Las Vegas union economy today. Shameful.\n\nComment from Ryan L. regarding this review: \""You're an idiot, straighten up.\"" and \""Stop with the immature reviews.\"" Congratulations, Ryan L., welcome to your fifteen minutes of fame.  As for me, I call it like I see it. Your approval is not needed.",0.0,0.9945494532585144
