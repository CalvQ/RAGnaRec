They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar.

CM was right on par with some of my favorite markets elsewhere. \n\nThe food was great. I ordered the club sandwich, which was not only made awesome, but was also reasonably priced. \n\nThe shop itself, as previously stated, reminded me a lot of some of my other favorite markets of the same genre.

Bread options are a bit limited compared to some places, but it's always been soft and delicious, with just enough tooth to it to be satisfying.

I ordered the 8 inch Chronic which was thinly sliced roast beef, BBQ sauce, green bell peppers, mushrooms & cheddar cheese. The place reminded me of Quiznos as the sub is toasted and you can add or subtract whatever you want on your sub once it is done with the toasting process. I added a touch of ranch, some pickles and some lettuce. Not too shabby. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie that I have yet to eat as the sandwich was very filling. Although the place was full, we did receive our orders pretty quickly and was out the door headed to our picnic in no time. \n\nSo if I am ever in the Tempe area and craving a sandwich, I just may have to stop by and grab me an \""illegal\"" sub over at Cheba Hut.

The bread rolls are made fresh at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three sandwich sizes: small (9\""), medium (12\""), and large (20\"").\n\nThe original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the \""Bobbie\"" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.\n\nAs much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20\"" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20\"" sandwich without any problems.\n\nI'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich.\n\nI'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options.\n\nGreat service and a friendly feel overall.

There are now branches of Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli and Canter's Deli.  Canter's is a branch of a famous Los Angeles deli; the other two are based in New York.\n\nCarnegie Deli should have stayed in New York.  Their sandwiches consist of two regular size pieces of rye bread, with what must be a pound of deli inside.  Large bamboo skewers hold everything together.  If that's not big enough, you can order the Woody Allen, which combines corned beef and roast beef for an even bigger sandwich.  You don't pick up the sandwich, you lift off the bread and use a fork.  Sounds good so far, but the corned beef was dry and not all that flavorful; same for the pastrami.  At breakfast, I tried the matzobrei, pancake style.  It was just an omelet with a little matzo thrown in - very disappointing.  Their menu doesn't even mention sour cream as an option - you have to ask for it.\n\nI really wanted Carnegie Deli to be good, especially because I've stayed at The Mirage a couple of times.  I kept trying, and continued to be disappointed.  Potato latkes were large, greasy, and crispy on the outside, but the potato was the consistency of mashed potatoes.

I am a sandwich lover. The bread they use is fantastic, but they hardly put any fillings inside the sandwiches, and the fillings are not high quality. The photos of the sandwiches here on Yelp, and on the posterboards in the store, are totally misleading. On our 3 sandwiches, you couldn't even see the filling unless you opened them up. They are beyond skimpy on the meat and cheese. I was also disappointed that they didn't offer a pastrami sandwich, I found the rest of the selection very limited too. The prices are cheap, but the sandwiches are tiny, and are 90% all bread. Please, charge me more money, and give me better quality meat and cheese, and put a little more on the sandwich, so it is more than just a bread sandwich. Their holiday turkey and stuffing sandwich was inedible it was so bad. It had a funny taste to it, the stuffing was bad, and there was only one small clump of the cranberry on one spot on my sandwich. Try some fresh carved turkey, and not some pedestrian lunchmeat turkey. The two good things about this place are the bread, and they do make your sandwich quickly, but that is partly because they don't waste time putting much inside the sandwich itself. I had way better sandwiches at 2 other places in Vegas. I find it very interesting that people can be fooled into thinking a sandwich is a good, based on the bread alone. If you like good bread and tiny portions of tasteless meat and cheese, then this is the place. I make a better sandwich with my panini maker at home. I will only go back when I am in the mood for toast.

I think it was just because Yelp made it seem like it was the best thing on the strip!  \n\nWell, maybe my opinion is skewed because I got a breakfast sandwich, which was not great at all.  The saving grace?  It was RIGHT next to our room and it was priced very very fairly.  \n\nFood: I got the Bacon, egg, and Swiss breakfast sandwich.   It was early in the morning and we had all been drinking. The sandwich came out PIPING hot. I thought that I was going to bite into it and be struck with inspiration to go and do something with my life.  All I got was a mediocre \""ehhhh\"".  I mean don't get me wrong, would I go out and get it again?  Yup, since it's so convenient.  I like my bacon crispy.  It wasn't crispy.  I guess I just had unreal expectations from yelp reviews.  \n\nPrice:  This probably earned the 3 stars rather than the 2 stars.  I think that it was VERY VERY reasonable.  After losing 90 bucks the night before, the last thing I wanted to do was shell out another 12 bucks for a breakfast sandwich.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI guess I'll just go and try it again.

Ingredient-wise you can see they use the same chicken across all their sandwiches and just dress the differently.  The chipotle dressing was nice and added a lot of flavor and the bacon and avocado where lacking a bit and didn't really punch through as much as I hopped.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken came out without any dressing so my GF had to get another, upon the second try it was better.  It didn't really have as much flavor as I was expecting.  Again, it was a solid, even a good sandwich...it just could have been more.\n\nService was kind of wonky.  You order and one register then pay at another down the line.

I don't live anywhere near this place but happened to be in the neighborhood yesterday, so I decided to make a stop here.\n\nI ordered a Regular Sized (9\"") Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Provolone & Peppers.\n\nThe woman working there was very nice and friendly.  The other customers in the joint appeared to be regulars because she knew them by name and already knew what a few of them wanted......very impressive.  You don't find service like that too often in Vegas.\n\nMy sandwich was very fresh & hot and looked awesome.  However, in the taste department it fell flat for me.  I thought the Beef was a little bland.....it didn't have that distinctive taste that I expect from a Steak Sandwich.  I also thought it could have used more Cheese as I could barely taste the Provolone.  The Peppers were good.....although, I didn't know you had the option to order Sweet or Hot Peppers until I overheard other people asking for them.....wish I would have known, I would have ordered Hot......to be fair, it's printed on the menu on the wall.....but I overlooked it as I was trying to read everything and figure out what to order before someone else came in and cut in front of me.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience and even though the Steak Sandwich didn't do it for me, I will give this place another try the next time I'm in the area so I can try the Pastrami & Swiss Burger and their Italian Sandwich.

Then there was the egg, which added a whole new layer of flavor. It didn't take away from the other flavors but added just enough to the mix. I didn't care for the salad that came with the sandwich. The mixed greens were a lil' weird. The vinaigrette was tasty though.\n\nI had my first encounter with a French Macaron here. I had no clue what it was but I asked about the flavors anyway. As soon as \""Salted-Carmel\"" left her mouth I was sold.  The $6.50 price is pretty steep but they are without a doubt a tasty treat which has sparked a hunt for them elsewhere in town.\n\nI also ordered a iced mocha latte which was delicious.

Now I do not want to give this place a bum wrap or take away well deserved stars for the rudeness of a few employees, but when they are the ones who are in charge of not only greeting your customers, but also making sure they feel welcome is it not important that they do their job correctly? \n\nI do not expect someone to offer a fake smile, and kiss up to me as a customer no I don't. But what I do expect is fair prices, good food, and a nice experience. If one of those elements is messing then chances are it will be a long time before I come back if at all. Bottom line this place has a nice selection of Vienna beef dogs, hamburgers, and sliders. The fries are good and crispy but as for the service, I recommend getting your food to go. Enough said!\n\nCase closed",1.0,0.9435099363327026

Basically you grab a paper sandwich bag that doubles as your order form, choosing the sandwich, your meats, cheeses, sauces, condiments, vegetables toppings, as well as the size of your 'wich.'  I gave up meat for the month of March so I went with a small Caprese:  tomato, mozzarella, and pesto on a toasted wheat roll, adding lettuce as an extra topping.  My teenager, the Devil, ordered a large meatball sandwich- -the nerve!  So, we handed over our orders and after a short wait, our names were called and we went to town on our meals.  It's not very nice to sit across from a kid eating a meatball sub while you sit eating a veggie sandwich, but mine was delicious just the same.  Oh, and when I checked in using my handy Yelp phone app, I got two FREE cookies.  I went back to the counter and showed the young man my phone and he had me fill out another order form for said cookies because they are baked fresh while you wait--kewl.

Didnt wanna do it here because I know you dont wanna waste your time reading this). Numbers 7 through 17 are sandwiches that have twice the meat and/or twice the cheese. You also have slim sandwiches which are any sandwich choice minus the veggies and sauce. For you carb conscious folks they have the JJ Unwich. Everything is the same except it's wrapped in lettuce instead of it being inside the bread. And finally, you have their ultimate sandwich called the JJ Gargantuan. Get this only if you are really hungry.\n\nSo once you decide what category you want, the choices get much easier since you wil decide based on how really hungry you are.\n\nI gave these guys 4 stars because of the really fast service and pretty good sandwiches.

It should be on a good Italian roll or baguette, crusty on the outside and soft inside.   I ordered my steak with white American cheese.  The cheese did not have much of a taste and wasn't creamy like a good brand of cheese (Land of Lakes, Clearfield) would have been.  The one thing they did right was chop the meat up on the grill.

Place was dead when I arrived and ordering was a little overwhelming for this newbie. The employees were helpful and explained to me the process. There's 10 different sandwiches to choose from and each option has a corresponding brown bag to write down your specifics of the order based on the type of sandwich you pick. There are toppings galore, which is a huge plus for me! It took me a few minutes just to read through the menu and choose my selections. I took my brown bag to the cashier and paid. After a few minutes of waiting, the cookies came out first and were warm. I ate one while I waited for my sandwich and it was pretty good. My total order was a turkey medium sub (10.5 inches), 2 cookies and a large drink for a total of $13. The large drink is good for .50 cents off of a refill if you bring in the cup again. Plus it was kinda cool looking so I bought it. As I was picking up my sandwich, I was told it was made on white bread instead of wheat. I was asked if I wanted them to make it again and but said no because I didn't want to wait again for my sandwich to be made. I've read on other reviews that sandwich orders were incorrect also so this may be somewhat of a problem here, I'm not sure. When I got home and ate my sandwich, I noticed it was a little too salty, not sure why. Overall, I like the concept but would go back and try some things differently :)",0.0,0.5465455651283264

The broth (which is the hallmark of Pho) is delicious - worthy of picking up your bowl and crushing it like a college freshman in a beer chugging contest.  The chicken for the Pho, however was blah, tasteless, and dissapointing.  Overall though, good dish, I'd recommend.\n\nThe thing they really have going for them is first, they're miles above that dreadful Chinese place that occupied the space previously, and second, they offer good value.\n\nThat pork sandwich?  less than $5 and certainly enough food by itself for a healthy appetite.  The Pho?  ~$7 which is a good value given the quality and quantity.\n\nCertainly worth checking it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip.",1.0,0.9905104041099548

But the sandwich as a whole, was unappetizing, and didn't have the fresh, crispness that I've come to expect from Capriotti's, Jimmy John's or hell, even Quiznos. \n\nDo yourself a favor. If you are in need of a stellar sandwich, and nothing is in sight, PLEASE go to the Walmart Neighborhood Market and pickup your own ingredients. Your own sandwich will taste better.\n\nAlso, if you are in this complex, pop in to Cheyenne Dental. They'll do a great job for you.
