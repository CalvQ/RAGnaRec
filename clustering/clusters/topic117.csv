There was no comparison.  See's was it.  I didn't even know they had stores then, much less stores that give out free candy just for coming in.  Kind of like a test drive without the pressure.\n\nAnd I still prefer See's over it's closest competitor to me, location-wise, Godiva.  Why?  Well, the free candy for one.  Number two, it doesn't cost $60 a pound, more like $16.  Granted, Godiva has prettier packaging and perhaps a better product, but not enough to compromise my loyalty.  \n\nI was recently saddened to see the store at Fashion Square close, but luckily, this one is nearby.  Much larger and easier to shop in, but my only complaint is that I had to stand in line with people hand-picking their boxes to pay for my pre-packaged items.  But since my husband was one of the pickers, I wasn't going anywhere until he was done anyway.  And his box was for me:)",0.0,0.8990347385406494

I was just there this morning to pick up more candy for her since she was running out.  I just thought I would mention the fact that they are always very courteous at See's and they do something very carefully that I most other establishments don't.  When you buy some candy, they have various box sizes -- half pound, one pound, two pound, etc. etc.  When they put your box on the scale when you are paying for your candies, the scale automatically adjusts for the weight of the box, whether it be the small half pound box, or a big five pound box.  You might not think that this is a big deal, but some places don't do this or the adjustment is not very accurate.\n\nAlso, I was using a gift certificate for one pound of candy so they filled the one pound box full -- when they weighed it, the weight was not quite one pound so they gave me the two extra pieces in a small bag.  Most places just fill the box and call it even.\n\nSo I think that See's concern for customer service and giving the customer full value for their dollar is very good, especially in today's \""bad customer service climate\"".\n\nIncidentally, my wife says that the value to price ratio of See's candy is even higher than Godiva Chocolates, Bill Blase chocolates, etc. etc.  She should know -- consuming maybe 50 pounds of choc candy each year!!",0.0,0.9133080244064332

Of that wall of candy, half is licorice flavored which totally doesn't count as candy to me.\n\nI know this place just opened so I am willing to give it some time to restock and find their market place but I would have been happy to just see something simple like Nerds or Jawbreakers or freakin M&Ms!

This is a candy lover's dream!  I never did have much of a sweet tooth.  My mom used to eat all my Halloween candy.  I like chips, popcorn, or pizza better.  With that being said, my daughter has a sugar addiction!!  I have to hide anything sweet or she will eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I ration the sweet stuff.  So when I saw that Sweeties had opened I knew I could NOT take her there.  However, while I was there all I could think of was that she would LOVE this place.  So yes, I did buy a few items.  They have an entire wall of Pez dispensers!!  OMG!  I love those darn things!  If you can think of a particular candy or gum, Sweeties probably has it or, if they don't, I'm pretty sure they know where to find it.  They put a lot of work into the store by organizing it all and making it easy to find things.

I don't want to offend anyone but really....lollipops with freakin bling on the stick for 20-25 dollars for one!? who in the right mind would buy a lollipop for 20 dollars!! and about 70 dollars for like three! besides that,  most of the other candy looks like they bought a bulk of candy  from costco or something and simply placed it in their own dispensers and are selling it for about 4-5 dollars a pound. It's like your regular sour heads, jelly bellies, sour gummies, gummies, etc etc etc \n\nI totally don't see anything special about this place...the only reason I was in here was for the gelato...now I was craving for ice cream/gelato - just something cold and sweet on 104 degree day and this was the closest place we were at that had gelato so decided to stop in here for a scoop. I ordered the lemon sorbet and surprisingly for about $4 they gave two generous scoops. It was just okay. Once again not quite sure why people would spend so much on regular candy....or the bling bling lollipop....but I can't judge the other side of this place since I didn't sit down for a meal at their restaurant...perhaps next time. \n\nHowever with all this said I guess I give them credit for attempting and not to mention succeeding to make a regular candy store more fancy than other candy stores at a mall....well i guess they are fancier than a candy store at the mall because they do have other desserts and pastries....like macaroons and cupcakes. However fancy mancy this place is....it's really just overpriced mediocre treats to me that are hyped up by celebrities and I am just not one to be so gullible  as to buy a 25 dollar lollipop.

Bacon flavored candies, a bacon wallet, bacon wrapping paper, bandages, candy bacon necklace, a \""funky fresh\"" bacon scented air freshener for the car!  \n\nI'll give you a moment to collect yourself...\n\nNext we move on to the mustachery. Finger staches, different celebrity staches to stick on your face, pink ones and skinny John Waters-esque staches. There were even ones to put on your drink, say at a party, to make sure you know which bev is yours.  Love it!\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes at all the greatness....novelty ice cube trays, party favors, sparklers, accent sprays (like for your mouth...for a \""gay\"" or Irish accent lolz).  \n\nThey even have a photo booth in the store, just in case you weren't having enough fun looking at all the wares!  The dude at the counter was super nice:)\n\nSmeeks, we shall reunite soon!",0.0,0.6926605105400085

I rarely drink sodas because the conventional ones are boring and filled with junk. Give me a old time treat. \n\nI opted for some sweet treats. I was feeling like having some taffy. Their prices for the portion was great! Half bag is $3, full bag is $5.99....that sounds vague, but basically they eyeball it and a half bag was more like almost 3/4 of the bagful and a full bag is one brimming to topple. Quite a deal considering most select-a-taffy would be about $6 for not quite half.  From my childhood there were Sixlets. I dunno why I don't like M&Ms, but I loved those. I grabbed some Cup-o-Golds, a habit I got from my \""if I can Step all over him\"" dad.

I love the name. First of all, SUGAR says it all. It is a store full of it. Funny though, I noticed that they also sold drinks. Coca Cola has distributed, to a small number of businesses, these tiny little Coke and DIet Coke beverages in tiny aluminum bottles.  The thing that made me laugh is that in a store called SUGAR that they'd even bother to sell the DIET COKE bottles. And yes, Clarisse C., I'm one of those silly ones who has couture pops!! They are perfectly round. I love the Watermelon and Green Apple pops. I was walking through that corridor and I noticed them. I had to buy a few for my girlfriends. They love them. They are indeed some serious \""luxe\"" pops. The ones that I purchased were the stone/BLING encursted, celeb endorsed varieties. Jeffrey L., what a sweet gesture it was for you to get one for Clarisse. Anyways guys, there is all kinds of sweet stuff in here. I have to admit, one thing that I didn't see was WATERMELON or RASPBERRY gummy bears. THere is only one place in the world that I know of that carries those lil bears. So, for that, four stars. I guess I just thought a place like this, although very small, should kind of have it all. ANyways, I liked the pops I bought. One of the girls tried to work a deal with me but I think I ended up working a better one for myself. HA! True, you can get the refill pops online but luckily I visit so often that I think I can just buy them when I roll into vegas every other month or so. One of the coolest things about their pops is that they can be covered if you're unable to devour them all at once. It's nice. You can carry it around with you in your purse or pocket even and not worry about everything around it getting sticky. Nice ideas. Steep prices. Fun times. It's vegas. I expect to spend cash when I'm there. I didn't mind. It was a bunch of fun lil things that I bought from here. Cool gift ideas.",1.0,0.9965092539787292
