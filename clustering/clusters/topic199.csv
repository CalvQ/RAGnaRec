Our pastor is an amazing speaker, my favorite part being that he tells he truth and stands up for it even when he knows he will get a lot of hate mail and a lot of offended people who will leave the church to look for somewhere else where the pastor doesn't step on your toes and hold you accountable. I wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says \""contemporary Christian music\"" I immediately think of Chris Tomlin, Brandon Heath, etc., and it's more of a gospel sound, if you have heard of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir our music is pretty much exactly the same. We do have a lot of energy in not only our worship but also some during the sermon. We have wonderful ministries for people of all ages, in church, out in the community, and around the world with our great missions department. The most common drawback for people is how big the church is. With over 8,000 members (I of course don't know exacts), and plenty who are not yet members, it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations. However we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both Providence and Country Day School if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot, and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary. Also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in. We have many different options with Sunday school classes you can attend, not just by age or \""single\"" or \""coues, but also different subjects (which I don't really know off the top of my head). So come check us out, although we are a great place to worship I know it might not be exactly what everyone wants. Well what can I say I LOVE MY CHURCH!!!",1.0,0.9981231093406676

St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. \n\nI've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. \n\nDuring the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. \n\nAround 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. \n\nThere isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you.",1.0,0.998848795890808

But this service has many people that attend and if your looking for a relaxed atmosphere this is the one. People of all lifestyles are welcomed are not judged nor is the message one of judgment. One thing be self sufficient in your life and not need charitable contributions. But I must be fair as I don't think many churches are equipped to address situations of that sort.

I checked out a few Christian churches,  even some spiritual centers but nothing resonated with me.  I was born and raised Catholic, so because of that some Protestant churches just don't work for me.  Sorry, I'm just not into all that hooting and hollerin' (or the threats of hell and damnation)!  I'm also very spiritual (not necessarily religious), so I can be wary of religious zealots.  But I've always been open to trying new churches out; so when my classmate invited me to come to hers, I thought sure why not!  Well let me tell you, I was hooked from day one.\n\nFCC is uplifting, delightful and there is lots of praise singing.  You can't help but join in!  It is a non-denominational, multicultural church.  The Sunday service is held at Saguaro High School at 10am.  Praise & worship singing goes on until about 10:30.  They also have bible study/service at 7pm on Wednesdays at their Phoenix location.  FCC is very welcoming and has such a cute way of welcoming new visitors.  \n\nEvery so often, a new topic will be presented as part of a new series.  It will be discussed for several Sundays/Wednesdays in a row.  Afterwards, you can purchase the recordings in mp3/CD for safe-keeping.  The \""Sex\"" series had just started when I began attending.  I was really impressed with how Pastor Moore handled the topic: he was very open, frank and respectful.  Any children present were ushered into another room, so adults could feel free to enjoy this topic.  I think it is a challenge for many Christians to follow God's word while traversing this terrain called \""Earth\"".  I found this series extremely helpful to me and anyone wishing to maintain closeness to God.\n\nSpeaking of children, they have their own program on Sundays in another part of the building.  I think this is really beneficial for them, allowing them to grow in their own faith with their peers.  They have the opportunity to start developing relationships with like-minded individuals.\n\nThis year celebrates FCC's 15th anniversary so they just held a 3-day celebration.

Children's section is fantastic...have had no problems. They give you a card/keyring tag so you can use the scanner yourself and check your child in if need be, and they make you show the matching sticker when you pick your child up. I do not know if the child care or other kids' workers have to go thru background checks.\n\nPastor Chads sermons ( they call them talks) are usually well-delivered, when he is there. It seems about half the time he is not and there is another pastor preaching, though. \n\nThe student ministry has a lot of fun things to do before and after service in their section, plus they have a juice bar where you can buy smoothies, etc, but the camps are pricey (both winter and summer camp) and my child didn't seem to get much out of camp either time, plus there are bullies at the camps, I guess like everywhere, but they didn't take enough precautions to prevent it even after knowing it had been happening.\n\nThe church likes to do a lot of various outreaches to the community,  like collect food for the shelters, etc, but sometimes, it seems they have their hands out just a bit too much asking for $$ for the various things so they can meet lofty goals that they set based on previous experience.\n\nThere are tons of small groups to get involved with. There are also ample opportunities to serve in quite a few areas and it's NOT overwhelming, like \""we need u every week!\"". Both of these things will help you feel like you know people/have friends in such a big church if you participate.\n\nLastly, and this is one of the big disappointments of mine besides the bullying at camp...the music during worship is only so-so. They often sing songs that I have no clue what the song is (I thought maybe it was because I was new at first...but I am not new now and still happening). They rarely sing any older contemporary songs or hymns. And, to top it off...after every single song, the band does not transition naturally to the next song. They stop and wait for clapping!  Soo offensive, bordering on either disorganization/can't figure out how to transition (doubtful) or arrogance.  The current worship pastor at least applauds with ppl like he is clapping to the Lord and not looking for his own pat on the back,  but I got the scoop from an insider...they want it to feel like a concert environment.  To me, worship is for the Lord and shouldn't be concert-esque. Should be worshipful and upward-focused. \n\nFyi current service times: Sat 430 amd 6pm. \nSun 9, 1030, 1159am. \nI do not believe they have all the teen groups' programs during all the services, though.",0.0,0.9798652529716492

My husband and I come from different religious backgrounds: I was raised as a Catholic and he was raised Born Again Christian. I hadn't gone to church for over ten years and didn't really plan on going back. Then, my four year old told me, \""Mommy, I want to go to church.\"" Like all parents nowadays I decided to totally let my child run my life and dictate where we go....ok, ok not really he did say that and he and I had a discussion about what he thought people did a church (sing songs and eat cookies) and what went on there. It really got me thinking about spirituality and religion and such. \n\nSo, I started the search for a church. I was looking for a church in which my whole family would feel comfortable. I was looking for some place that was open to all and did not discriminate. I was also looking for a church that did not make me feel like I had to either send my child away or sit in an enclosed place so the adults could worship in peace. I started my search on-line and went to several churches websites. I found one that seemed to meet all the criteria, but I was skeptical. I figured we'd give it two services and then try another and then another and then eventually just give up and go back to sleeping in on Sundays. \n\nFrom the moment I walked in I felt like this was a different kind of church. The people who greeted us at the front door were so friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy we were there. Pastor Paul gave a sermon that I felt was very relevant to me and what was going on in the world. I felt very comfortable and so did the rest of my family. We never ended up going to check out other churches although it did take us several months to decide to actually commit to DHC, not because we were unsure, but because it seemed like such a huge commitment and I didn't want to jump into anything. The DHC members we have met are so nice and caring. It's a church that takes God seriously but not themselves. So, if you are looking for a church that is inclusive of everyone and feels like a place you are wanted and cared about. I highly recommend Desert Heritage Church. \n\nP.S.

Didn't know if he temporary or what, only knew that he was in fact coming to us live.

I've attended several megachurches in the past, but this is by far the largest church building I think I've been in, with plenty of parking to boot. Parking was pretty well controlled by volunteers.\n\nUpon entering, it was almost overwhelming. People milling about, a stylish cafe, tons of classrooms, and the huge auditorium/chapel. I think about 2,400 were in attendance at the 10:20 am service I went to.\n\nMembers of this church are super friendly, people wishing me a Happy New Year everywhere I went, including the sinks in the restrooms. Lots of families, looked like a pretty diverse demographic too.\n\nThe service itself was similar to other megachurches I've been to. Concert-style worship with an amazingly talented worship team on stage, dim lights, brightly colored spotlights, two large video broadcast screens with song lyrics overlaid on live video. Announcements were all done on video.\n\nThe sermon was presented by guest speaker Bill Butterworth of Southern California (http://www.billbutterworth.com/) who delivered a solid message with great foundations. I felt it was geared more towards newer believers (and service was also very short), but I don't mind that at all. The message was clear and easy to understand and remember, which is important.\n\nIf I lived in Las Vegas, I would probably put this church high on my list of churches to check out again and possibly become a member of! Highly recommended, especially for newer believers looking for a place to seek God and learn how to get grounded in the Bible.

I took a look at the website and read about it and it seemed like it may be a cool young hip church to check out since it comes off as very contemporary place... \n\nAs much excitement as I had to check it out once we got there I became a little unsure. We checked in our kids to the children's area which definitely seemed well put together and organized. So it was off to a good start. The folks that we first met seemed nice but almost a little too excited that we had come to check out the church, but that is normal in a sense in the church world. \n\nWaking into the building I was definitely shocked that the crowd had to have a median age of 45 and was a majority older crowd.

Once the service started I guess I was expecting a more upbeat alive worship experience and unfortunately that was not it. Again, from the website I imagined that the worship would be upbeat and contemporary but it was mellow and tame. There were quite a few issues with the tech side of things and stopping worship to transition into a 20 minute \""clip\"" of a Dave Ramsey video was definitely a little deflating. \n\nAs for the service, the pastor had a decent message but it was just not my style of preaching. In my own personal opinion it was very dry and not much emotion... \n\nAs far as a church is concerned, Not every church is for every person and this one was not for us, and just like the message mentioned if it is not for you, move on.",0.0,0.9955886602401732

I loved being a part of this church.  I even went on a mission trip with them.  Also, Pastor Tom's parents are amazing people.  I loved them a lot.\n\nI used to sing on their Praise Team every Sunday, for 3 services, AND on Wednesday nights.  \n\nPastor Tom is passionate about what he preaches.  \n\nHOWEVER.\n\nWhat I have a problem with, is the fact that if you try to take time away to take care of yourself, you are looked down upon.  \nIf you're sick, you're asked to \""push through\"" and \""serve\"" anyway...in my case I was being asked to sing 3 services with a sore throat and no voice. \n\nThis went on for 3 weeks.  I had a terrible cold and was \""not allowed\"" to take a Sunday off to get some rest until I threatened to flat out quit the praise team.  I'm sorry, but how can you effectively \""serve\"" the church if you aren't well?  \n\nI am a student and teacher of Middle Eastern dance, and was CONSTANTLY asked when I was going to give it up.  Um.  Never.  God granted me the ability to dance, and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with what I was doing, so why should I stop?  \n\nI started taking Ballroom dance classes, and was told that I shouldn't do that because I might be \""tempted\"" into sin by dancing.  Didn't David dance before the Lord?  Didn't we have a dance team there of \""hip hop\"" dancers?  Hypocrits.\n\nI also have never met a church so money hungry in my life.  They had a campaign a few years ago to raise a million dollars to build a new sanctuary.  At the time, I was on board, and pledged to give a LOT more than I could afford.  \n\nWell, times were tough, and I ended up needing the money to pay bills and take care of things...and I received harrasing letters \""reminding\"" me that I had pledged to GOD that I was going to give this money. I'm sorry.  I have to take care of myself, because if I don't pay my bills, we all know that the church and god wouldn't step in and pay them for me. \n\nI cannot get behind a church that looks down on you and harrasses people.  Maybe if you take better care of your people (giving them a day off every now and again...the Pastors get a day when there are guest speakers...just sayin...) and stop hounding people for money...preach more about God and his love.  Not his love of money.  MY god isn't a selfish materialistic god...\n\nI hope this church has turned around since i've been there.

It's for adults only.  Take your kids to childrens' church.\""  \n\nThe problem?  My son has high functioning autism, and cannot abide the noise and activity in the kids' service.  He comes with us, covers his ears during the music, and sits quiety through the sermon.  No problem, no distraction to those around us.  \n\nSo, we didn't go.  Apparently the Pastor had some complaints about barring children from the service, and his response on facebook was this: \""I am not here for children.  I am here to talk to adults.  That is my responsibility.\"" \n\nHow very, very sad.  Downright depressing -- that the leader of a chuch would absolve himself of his responsibility to at least half of his congregants.  Are our children that unimportant?  Are they that expendible?  \n\nWhen I called the church to ask to speak to a member of the church leadership about this incident, the woman who answered the phone was very defensive and evasive, despite the fact that I was calm and very polite.  She asked why we didn't just attend the service anyway.  I told her it was because Pastor Mark specifically told us not to.  She sounded upset by that answer.  I asked again to speak to a member of the church leadership, and she said, \""I will pass this message along to them.  IF they choose to call you back, it will be within the week.\""\n\nTwo weeks later -- and you guessed it...no callback.  \n\nWe are now attending Central Christian Church.  When I called to ask about their policies for special needs children and whether children were disallowed from the main \""adult\"" service, a member of the church's staff called me back within an hour.  I was assured that our children, regardless of their needs, were welcome at any service any time.

Be it a class, small church, support group, or other gathering, you can find whatever is right for you for your place in life.

We've experienced a great deal of controversy and heartbreak in the past two years with our former pastor.  All through this turmoil, the congregation is still strong, as I'm sure it would be in any other church, regardless of the denomination, where its parishioners have faith.  Roman Catholic or not, the priests and staff are welcoming to all who come to worship, always making a point to acknowledge anyone who may be visiting for a service.  DeeDee, the musical director, has a singing voice like an angel and I always hope she's singing at the masses that I attend.
