The boy went for the Smoked Duck Breast with Celeriac Remoulade, Celeriac Chips & Spiced Apple which he really enjoyed and both dishes were beautifully presented. To finish we shared the Pink praline tart which was also very pretty and came with a lovely almond ice cream. \n\nIf you fancy a delicious meal out for slightly less, their pre-theatre menu is excellent good value with 2 courses for around 12 pounds or 3 for 15.\n\nOverall a very delicious meal, a great atmosphere and a very lovely evening out.",1.0,0.9996827840805054

Likewise, I was so saddened by the closure. When I heard about the new restaurant at Venetian, I made a reservation as soon as I could. It did not disappoint.\n\nDaniel was in the kitchen when we were there, so I had very high expectations. All I can say is, get the duck! The duck is absolutely superb. Service is also top notch. I will return in the near future for a more detailed review.",1.0,0.9995262622833252

Manager Chris and Chef Dave went above and beyond to meet my requests and did so with perfection! Outstanding French Onion Soup, scrumptious Duck Confit, and OMG (why does CA suck?!) amazing Foie Gras. \n\nAm so glad that Daniel has another place in Vegas; it's been too long since I've enjoyed his food.  \n\nAm thinking of my next meal there, in about a month!

We ordered a gnoochi appetizer which was amazing and for our entree we got the seared duck.  To our surprise, I believe the owner came out, and brought us out two dishes of the duck.  We had a full meal and didn't have to share and they didn't charge us for the extra plate!  The duck was amazing!!  Cooked to perfection!  Beautiful restaurant and delicious food.
