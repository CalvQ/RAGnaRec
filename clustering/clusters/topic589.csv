Out of lamb, you say? A middle-eastern restaurant called Flaming Kabobs out of lamb?  Out of lamb you say?  Am I to believe that I drove.... miles (I don't want to say how far I drove to get hubby's lamb!)  and you DON'T have lamb?  Yes. I understand now.  You DON\""T have lamb!  \nHubby had to choose beef kabobs (which I could make at home).  Asked for them bloody-----not rare---bloody!  Plentiful kabob dish came out and when he cut into them they were medium, only one or two pieces were rare.  That's two disappointments in one evening.  Hubby, kept silent (he is the strong, silent type) and ate.  He made the best of his over-cooked kabobs, but then again most people eat them medium or medium rare so the cooks were not skilled in preparing kabobs according to HIS palate.  He had a very good salad with it,  some pretty good rice (although I think it is converted rice and not real rice) and plenty of warm pita.  I ordered a small vegetarian appetizer that was delicious and they gave me more than enough pita to clean my plate of the vegetarian delights.  \nSo all in all they had two strikes against them--no lamb and overcooked beef kabobs (I will ignore the converted/minute rice).  That means that I have to deduct two stars from 5 leaving 3.  But as you can see, I gave them 4 stars-- one additional star for the lovely young lady who waited on us.\nCould you please buy some lamb for your customers?  Thank you.",0.0,0.9909073114395142

My wife's entre was kafta kabob, minced lamb with chopped onion and spices and served with tziki sauce while I ordered lamb kabob.  The kafta kabob was too light on the spices.

My girlfriend and I could have easily split one plate and been perfectly full.\n\nThe taste of the food itself was pretty good as well. The Lamb had a nice bold flavor, and the Chicken tasted as though it had some sort of curry powder on it. The Taftoon bread was pretty tasty, though a little dry. I wasn't too crazy on the rice though, which was nice in its texture, but lacked the taste I was hoping for. \n\nI must say, that despite being pretty tasty, most of the meat smelled fairly rank. I'm a big fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cusine, but the aroma coming off of this meet smelled of pure flatulence. A small price to pay for tasty food.\n\nOne of the highlights of this place though was the wonderful service. The workers were extremely helpful, and even brought us a free order of their Baklava and Zulbia desserts, which were also both pretty tasty.\n\nOverall, this place is definently worth checking out. Just remember when ordering that the $9.99 special is definently food enough for two people, so if you're ordering for one opt for the cheap meals that give you just one Kubideh.",1.0,0.9240206480026244

It's owned by the same folks who run Open Sesame Market, right next door. The market sells great products so I figured they should serve them well too. However that's not the case.\n\nWe ordered the lamb kebab and beef shawarma plates, the appetizer trio (choice of humus or babaganouj, falafel and dolmas) and fries. The fries were underdone and over seasoned. The lamb and beef were seasoned fairly well but were overdone. The dolmas were bland, the falafel was pretty tasty but, get this...no humus or babaganouj. They ran out! I'd go back to a joint just for the humus if it was good enough. You can't run a middle Eastern restaurant and run out of humus, it simply isn't done. The food is dirt cheap, I can give them that, and the service was excellent. Those were the only bright spots of the experience.\n\nI definitely recommend a visit to Open Sesame Market but if you're hungry do yourself a favor, head across the street and hit up J.T. Gryos.

This was despite the many dishes that were very strange. By strange I mean not good....what is this???? and why would this taste this way??? I am not sure how one could mess up penne pasta with Greek dressing or orzo pasta but they managed to make it inedible. Many things looked pretty dry and maybe not from today. The cook staff loading things in using their fingers is a little unappetizing too. Like another review said, maybe they could make it if they took out two buffets and just had two. Then they could focus on the better dishes. The straw that made them get 1 instead of 2 stars was that they charge you $1 for each tap water they serve your table.... Really? $6 for tap water for our table. I admit I am very picky but my husband is not. His motto is quantity over quality. And he said we will not go back. I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes. I hope to hear that they shorten the buffet and focus on quality.
