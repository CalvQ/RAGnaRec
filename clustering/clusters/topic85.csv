I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever, meaning that I'm fairly clueless about how to pick one out).  Also, since I'm a student, I don't have particularly deep pockets.\n\nAt Big Bang, I was greeted basically the moment I walked in the door.  I'm kind of shy when I know that I don't really know what I'm doing, but I wasn't pressured or harassed in any way by the staff.  Even though my price range was pretty low, they still tried their hardest to find a bike that suited my needs, and they found a bike that fitted me perfectly (and gave me an *excellent* deal on the price).  They take a lot of care to make sure you're properly fitted to the bike.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few bike stores I've been to where test riding is gleefully encouraged, rather than grudgingly allowed.  Definitely it's the only bike store where they'll tell you \""You haven't tried it out enough, go climb up the hill on  it!\"" -- they definitely put the emphasis on matching rider with bike, rather than making a quick sale.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a road bike, whether they're a seasoned racer or a neophyte rider like me.",1.0,0.995793342590332

I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?",0.0,0.9972937703132628

As many have written, without supporting LBSs you couldn't have the community atmosphere or physically try the product.  \n\nI've been doing night rides with Slippery Pig for about two years and grown to know Eli and Byron.  I also met Eric the owner and he's always been easy to talk to and always had an open ear to some of my questions on bike equipment. \n\nI finally decided to pick up my first 29er hardtail and decided to go with the Scott Scale Expert. Rather than doing it myself I wanted to change out the drive train to a 2x10 set up and Slippery Pig was more than willing to oblige.  They went through the trouble of picking up the bike from their fountain hills location, change out the drive train and other upgrades I wanted within the same day.  Yes, same day!  \n\nI also wanted to change out the pedals to crank brothers but unfortunately they didn't have them in stock.  Eric just let me borrow some demo pedals while my new pedals came in so that I could enjoy my ride the next day.  In this writing I just picked up my new pedals (1 week turn around) and will be returning the demo pedals tomorrow.  Now if that isn't client service I don't know what is.\n\nCould it be the client service was directly related to my relationship with the staff.  You decide.  Could I have saved more buying on-line?  Sure.  But if you're in the mtb scene it's all about community.  I know the folks at Flat Tire, Airpark, and Rage and they're all a great bunch of guys.

Well, I'm not paying $5,000 for a bike without test-riding it first. So I put my name down to take their demo for a spin.

Yeh, dude, I did that. We spent an hour talking.\n\nI ended up buying a Pivot Mach 429 at another store, and I ain't never been happier. Their loss.\n\nBut back to the Pig. I also own an old hand-me-down Bianchi road bike that I use for getting around town (two wheels are better than four, people).

The employees of this business are nice, cool and helpful, but sadly they are led by an owner who does not understand how to treat customers. \n\n A group of friends and I flew to PHX for a four-day ride on the Arizona Trail. We were hoping for good local advice and for good rental bikes that were equipped to handle the trail. We got the opposite. We were advised that we did not need slime in our inner tubes, which ended up costing us our first trail day. Collectively we had 12 flats in our first hour on the trail because (as we quickly learned) the AZ trail is full of sharp hazards and slime is absolutely necessary to avoid flats. We had to abandon our first day and catch a ride into Tucson to buy slime tubes. Take my advice, not theirs - if you're riding the AZ trail, buy several slime tubes or your trip will be ruined. \n\nAnother issue is that two of the rental bikes from Cactus had split tire sidewalls. To send a bike out like that is amateur. Unfortunately, by the time we discovered this, we were about two hours from Cactus and ready to embark on the trail, so we booted one tire and changed the other to a brand new tire we had purchased (and which they now have on their rental bike courtesy of us). \n\nAfter the trip, I called the manager about these issues and she immediately got defensive and turned everything back on me. She said it was my fault that we listened to her employee's advice about the slime. And she straight up said I couldn't be telling the truth about the split sidewalls, because her shop would never make a mistake like sending out a bike like that. \n\nI think this shop must not have much nearby competition, or maybe she just doesn't care about my business because I'm from out of town. I got off the phone feeling beat up, and I'm the customer (who spent hundreds in her store). I don't think it's unreasonable to count on a bike shop for good local biking advice, and to count on that bike shop for a rental product that's checked out and ready to ride. But it's not even those issues that are most galling. Everyone makes mistakes - that's just human. But my treatment on the back end was terrible and prompted this review.",0.0,0.9992908239364624

If they do a good job I suppose it's excusable.  \n\nI decide to leave the bike there.  The mechanic says I can pick it up around 5:00pm or so.  \n\nHalfway through the day, I get a phone call from the mechanic.  He says the tension pulley is defective and suggests I take my new bike back to the store.  A few minutes later he calls me again to tell me the problem is 'fixed, but he wants me to keep an eye on it -- and I can come pick it up' (is this so he can actually charge me some money?).\n\nI pick it up, get insulted one more time (\""Where did you buy this bike?  Toy-R-Us?\""), pay $40, walk out, and I'm immediately able to reproduce the same problem.  \n\nIn (previous reviewer) Sarah's defense:\nIt appears that ownership of this store changed in August 2008.  This is clearly posted at the entrance to the repair shop in the rear of the store.  Whatever awesome sauce this place had previously has been replaced by epic failure.\n\nNow for the review part:\nClearly, you have rehearsed your insults, Bicycle Ranch.  They were brief, to the point, and delivered with a polished arrogance.  You get a star for this.  \n\nCatering to the super-rich set in Scottsdale is brilliant.  Positioning your store directly to the left of a 'Target' seems like an odd choice of location though.  -1 star.\n\nYour service needs a bit of help.  $40 for some wonderfully delivered insults is one thing, but $40 for some insults + a bike that still has the same problems as when I brought it in is just sloppy.  -2 stars.\n\nNot having any bikes in the store that I would be interested in (or could purchase for under $500):  -1 star.\n\nEnd result:  Fail.  \nVerdict?  Patronize one of the 4 other bike shops within a half mile of this place.  You'll get better service, much fewer insults, and at a fraction of the cost.  The new ownership of this place needs to shape up or leave.",0.0,0.9971187114715576

When we arrived to pick up his ride and thought they were kidding when they showed him the trike. It was a black piece of crap sitting next to a good looking red trike. Again, we thought the rental guys were messing with my friend when they told hime the black one was for him.\n\nThe red one had just come in from a ride and had a clutch problem. I wish I had a close up photo to put on Yelp to show the trike he ended up with. We are all Harley owners and pride ourselves on keeping our bikes looking good and properly serviced. This trike was an embarrassment. The paint was scratched, the fenders were scraped and it looked like it had been cleaned with steel wool. It was a mess to look at. The switch for the  radio volume was missing and the CD player worked intermittently.\n\nThe EagleRider lot guy who checked out the bike said he thought this trike should not be in service but the manager did not really care. The good news was that we had no mechanical problems for our 5 day ride through the canyons of UT, NV and AZ. I would also say that the 2 wheel bikes on the lot looked to be in much better condition.\n\nIf you are renting a trike, make sure you know exactly what you are going to get before you pay for you rental.",0.0,0.9994237422943116

For someone who had an idea to start something new, with no idea if I'd stick with it, $500 was quite an investment. \n\nSo we finally decided to pick up a $200 bike from Walmart (don't hate me), figuring that if I really did ride it often, in two years or so I could move up to the big-kids $500 bikes - and know that the money isn't wasted.\n\nWell, you get what you pay for. My fabu little bike was changing gears alllll on its own (isn't that cute?) as I rode, and twice the chain decided it was over the whole thing and jumped off completely. I was getting sick of nearly dying, so I figured maybe my little $200 walmart assembled bike had some 'issues'. \n\nFrom a friends recommendation I decided to stop by Bob's to see if they would see what the heck was going on. I came in on a busy Thursday and Dale helped me out immediately. He was very nice and supported me in not spending much on a bike to start out, and offered to take a look at the bike & see what he could do. He took the bike back, and within 10 minutes had adjusted the cables & gears to the point that the bike was behaving beautifully! I was so happy, and asked Dale how much I owed him - and he said not to worry about it. Just come see him when / if I needed a new tired or an adjustment. \n\nWell I am now telling everyone I see just how great Dale & this shop is.

When I picked up the bike we were very late - 10 minutes before closing due to taking a wrong turn and rush hour traffic. So I quickly signed the papers and took delivery of the bike.  At the\ntime of taking delivery I noticed the rear view mirror was spinning around and since everyone was in a hurry I said I can tighten it later. When I went to tighten it both the bottom and top was stripped by the person prepping the bike. The oil was also overfilled. After I got back I noticed that they overcharged me $100. When I wrote them the check for the bike I did not see the $100 deposit deducted from credit card\nso I presumed they had not done this. Instead of crediting the $100 back to my credit card as they should have they merely increased the price by $100. Since the middle\nof September I have called Derek many times about these issues.

One of the mechanics told me if I wanted them to put it together it would be around $500 and then the head mechanic came out and said he wouldn't do it.  He told me they're too complicated to put together, something about the gears being too hard to calibrate.  At this point I was near hysterics.

Larry not to worry, I bought it yesterday and the bike literally didn't touch the pavement. \""Ahh yeah but we can never know for sure, we still have to charge you $38 for a re-tuning/re-stocking fee.\"" I'll spare you every pathetic detail but when I called him out on the fact that it was a Walmart bike and it won't need re-tuning he said something VERY interesting. \""Well those Walmart bikes are poor quality.

I am very disappointed with the level of service I have received in regard to my bike repair. \n\n5 weeks ago I was in a nasty crash and immediately took my bike to the store. It was brought to my attention that my carbon frame had cracked (minor) and that I had two options; 1) buy a new ride or 2) send to Calfee in California to have them repair. After trying out 2 bikes (awesome rides BTW) to buy I chose the latter as my current ride just feels perfect to me plus spending 5k+ just isn't financially responsible at this point in time. \n\nSo LVC packed and sent my bike frame to Calfee. It was repaired and shipped back to the store on October 9th, 10 days ago. Last Friday (12th) I was told they needed another day or so to complete putting my bike back together. I never heard from them all weekend. On Monday I was phoned by them and told my bike would be ready by Wednesday (17th), Thursday (18th) at the latest (they needed to order a headset and tire which they didn't have in stock).  \n\nI didn't receive a call on Wednesday so I followed up with them yesterday to see what the status was. They responded that the headset hadn't come in and that by Friday it will be done (I literally just got the call as I was typing this review that it is ready and I am heading there now to pick it up after completing this review). \n\nWhile I really like the people at LVC and have sent several people to buy bikes there over the past year, the fact that I have been without my bike now since September 15th is beyond frustrating. For LVC to sit on my bike for 5 days (left in the box) before even opening it seems ridiculous. Further, when they tell me it will be done by a certain time and then keep pushing back the timeline is not what I would consider as the best customer service. \n\nThere is no point in mentioning anything when I go to the store now, I will just take my business elsewhere in the future as they clearly have indicated to me that my business isn't that important to them. I find this all unfortunate too, I like supporting local mom and pop type businesses but this one has lost my business and my referrals going forward.",0.0,0.9993916749954224

She did a foot analysis and watched me walk on a treadmill to make sure it was a good fit.  Her expertise, knowledge, and attentiveness was fantastic.  She also told me about LVC's weekly running club on Thursday evening that I hope to check out soon.  \n\nIf you are a cyclist, runner, triathlete- or have always wanted to try it- this is the place to go!

He ended up buying a Specialized Rockhopper, and with a couple of upgrades is  a very nice bike. The next day we went riding and noticed, the lack of detail that went into the build. The front tire had wobble, the derailed cables were left so long that they rubbed the tires, and the rear d\u00e9railleur was jumping out of gear. The lack of care and attention to detail on someone's brand new bike purchase is appalling. He took the bike back and had further issues, such as not being called when service was completed and front tire barely spinning. He also wanted to buy some accessories and even with 10% off with new bike purchase, everything is grossly overpriced. We decided to buy that stuff elsewhere.

I had in mind what I wanted and was doing an upgrade to my current bike. I was hesitant where to start since the reviews were so varied, and I was dreading dealing with potentially non helpful sales people. This was not the case!  I was greeted immediately and directed to Javier. He was sensational. He listened to what I was looking for, explained certain specifications as questions arose, in simple terms. He was very patient as I test drove over 5 models each one improving from the last decision until we fine tuned into  the perfect bike that I am now in love with!\n   I wanted a smooth, quiet comfortable ride for hour long exercising sessions that would allow frequent shifting for hills and dales. I got a Haro Heartland Sport model women's bike. I honestly didn't care what color it was, so to have it in white with purple to pink trim was a bonus.  It corners like a dream, going up hills that were challenging in the past were almost effortless. The brakes are responsive & crisp. Javier showed me how to adjust the handlebar height and angle, and made it into something very comfortable for me. He also took time out to show me how to take off the front tire and put it back on for easier loading into the car. He fine tuned everything and told me to bring it back in a month for another safety check. He even threw in a nice big white basket on the front for all of my accessories. To say that I am a very satisfied customer is an understatement. I love this place and will be back. They also quickly repaired a flat for my husbands bike too. My other riding partner was so impressed with the ride and the service and price, she is going to get the same model. She couldn't believe all that came with the bike. They went out of there way to make my shopping experience as pleasant as it could be. Thank you again, you really made my day and my rides a lot easier. Sincerely Eva Dahl",1.0,0.998082399368286

My derailer was quite noisy and needed adjustment. I saw that Mcghies had a derailer adjustment for $15 dollars. I've done their tune up for $70 and was happy with it. I decided to try Bike World because it was closer and also because it seems like it is a more mom-and-pop type shop. I like the service of smaller shops because people are very happy to have your business and generally it seems less stuffy. Well, anyways i decided that instead of a derailler adjustment I would pay extra and do a tune up. Bike World's price was $6.50 less than Mcghie's. I dropped it off at the location and was given a two day turnaround. I typically ride my road bike on Thursdays so I asked if it might be done a bit early. The gentleman asked me to check Wednesday. I did and they were close to finishing it. I was happy about that. I arrived, paid and picked it up. I notices that the bike was dirty. There was grease on the frame. Then, I looked at the cogs and the chain. They were greasy. I looked at the derailer. It was adjusted. I'm happy that the derailer was adjusted but a tune-up typically has the cassette degreased and cleaned, the chain degreased and cleaned, the brakes adluster and the frame wiped down. It looked like all they did was adjust the derailers and brakes. I am mechanically inclined and could have done the adjustments and the tune up myself but I chose to pay so a professional could do the tune up. Not, being happy with it I asked what exactly a tune-up entailed. There window says its a 15 point tune-up. The gentleman seemed embarrassed and offered to clean it up, so maybe he just took a short cut on my bike and maybe it's usually not like this. I personally am not willing to find out. I am going to continue going to McGhie's or ask my riding group for a good bike shop.",0.0,0.9975925087928772

I grew up at 75th Ave. & Bell Rd., when the roads were dirt and the land was filled with orange groves.\n\nWhen RideNow PS came into the valley, they came in like a Wal-Mart of riding. Some of their staff lacked the support and resources to be as efficient and productive as the community needed them to be. Some of the staff were downright asses, and that unfortunately gave RideNow a big black eye.\n\nRecently my husband and I wanted to buy the new Yamaha FJ-09's. ABS, traction control, adjustable everything, comfortable upright position without losing the feel of a sport bike. Being that the model was so new, we had no other option than to go to RideNow and suck it up.\n\nNot only was the salesman, Stephen Brown (in the Surprise store) very informative, but he kept in touch with us via texting and phone as we had questions surface. They only had one of the bikes we wanted, and I sure wasn't going to give mine up, so they found another one in red for the hubby. We countered their asking price and they accepted.\n\nFrom the moment we came in to make the purchases, they were friendly, knowledgeable, and offered the best service. We dealt with Stephen, the salesman, spent all the time we wanted and needed with the sales manager Chip, and had an opportunity to sit and talk with the head of the service department. He was able to address any questions we had. We walked out of the dealership and knew we had acquired exactly what we wanted at the price we were comfortable with. We also had found new riding friends.\n\nI also own a rider training school in Arizona called RideSmart Motorcycle Training, Inc. We have no affiliation with any dealership and choose to keep it that way. It's up to the consumer to pick what is right for them. We don't care what you ride, it's that you ride. With the experience that we had at RideNow, I feel really comfortable recommending my students to their store. I can't say that the previous reputation would have led me to do that, but I now have seen first-hand, they have good people working there.\n\nI'm not paid or get anything for writing this. Go there, decide for yourself. Make your own opinion. One of my personal favorites for gear is still the Helmet Center  (don't ever finance your safety gear or you'll pay too much over the length of the loan). But for a bike, scooter, Slingshot, CanAm, RideNow Surprise has a couple of new fans. Just know that they folks working there now are the best of the best.\n\nAngela Orton\nOwner, RideSmart Motorcycle Training, Inc.\nwww.MotorcycleTrainingAZ.com",0.0,0.8913273811340332

Over the last week in June I scoped out four area bike shops in search of my very first bicycle. During that time I went to Bicycle Haus where I spoke with Shasta, the owner about what I was looking for in a bike and what my budget was. She was great and immediately pointed me in the direction of the Specialized Carmel I, giving me loads of reasons it would be the perfect bike for me. When I saw the price tag I relayed my budget concerns and she said \""You know, we can make it work for you,\"" and then helpfully talked me through all the accessories that I would need to have a safe, pleasant ride. I told her my time frame to buy was about three weeks later, thanked her very much and went on my way. After visiting the other 3 shops I still liked my experience with BH the best and was also pleased with it's proximity to my house which would make getting there for tune ups and future supply needs extremely easy. \n\nFast forward selector: I walk in on a Tuesday, just to talk to someone about renting the bike before I bought it, and was pointed to John (Shasta wasn't there) and we talked briefly about the model, purchasing and renting. I was a little put off by him because even though there were three other guys working there, he would leave me to go answer the phone and ring up other customers. Come on dude, let's focus on customer service here. I decided to go back a few days later to speak with Shasta again directly. \n\nWhen I went in two days later, Shasta was there but didn't remember me, nor attended to me. I found John who also had a hard time remembering who I was FROM TWO DAYS AGO and we went over all the things I would need again and I told him flat out that Shasta had told me we could make my budget work with this specific bike. He stood there looking at me blankly, pointed to the price tag and said, \""well I don't know what she told you but the price is $450.\"" Then I asked him if he would put together an invoice so I could see exactly how much all of this was going to cost me.  More blank staring, then he told me he didn't know how so he left me at the counter just waiting for someone else to help me. Shasta attended to a few other people who were milling around and then said she could do the proposal for me. Still no recognition. After we went through everything the price was almost $200 more than I could spend! I walked out extremely frustrated. \n\nI'm sure you could explain away not remembering me, but I work in a similar small, specialized industry and even if I don't remember names I always remember faces and frankly in this economy I don't believe that Bicycle Haus has a ton of people coming in looking to purchase their first bike right now. I find both John and Shasta's behavior very off-putting and very disappointing. I am all for supporting small businesses and ESPECIALLY women-owned businesses but there's no way I would ever recommend Bicycle Haus to a novice rider/shopper based on my very Jekyl and Hyde experiences.",0.0,0.9893510937690736

He contacted another store, went to pick it up in his car, and called me the next morning that I could stop by and pick up MY new bike!!  \nJonathan walked me through all the details of what I'd need to start riding again.  He even helped me find and fit the perfect helmet!  \nThe great guys in the shop attached my kick stand, and water bottle holder, and Jonathan made sure my front and back lights were positioned properly.\nThe icing on the cake was when Jonathan taught me how to take the front wheel of the bike off, and then loaded it into my car for me!  \nExcellent advice from bike experts, and OUTSTANDING service!!

This was the 4th bike I had purchased here in the last 2 and a half years, the other three times it was a decent experience (2 for my kids, mine last year at this time and now one to replace my girlfriend's bike that had been stolen from our garage).  This time, we came in on a Thursday evening looking for a particular brand and model. No problem, they had it, just not in the size we needed.  The guy that was there was very helpful (but, unfortunately leaving for vacation in 30 minutes) and said he would leave a note to have the size we were looking for built out the next morning so we could come by and try it out later that day.  By mid-day, we had heard nothing, so I called to find out when it would be ready.  Got a long winded story about how the he was all by himself and hadn't gotten to it yet, but he would build it out as his next task.  I said OK  and that we would be by in a few hours to give it a ride, which he indicated would be fine.  2 hours later, he still had not started it and tried to claim he knew nothing about it (now in person, rather than on the phone) until it was pointed out that the staff the previous day had left a note that was clearly visible at the counter. After acknowledging that, it was indicated that it probably wouldn't be ready until Saturday.  Came by at around 4:30pm on Saturday to finally give the desired bike a test ride.  That part went well, and we proceeded to complete the transaction, purchasing one additional item since he offered us 10% off any accessories.  I pointed out that they still needed to add the reflectors and the water bottle holder (which was clearly visible on the size small bike of the same model).  He said that the water bottle holder didn't come with the bike, only the piece that held it to the handlebars.  Once again, I referred to the size small bike (we were buying a size medium) that was 5 feet away and pointed out that we were of the opinion that it should be included. He was having none of it and this after he'd given us the runaround on the build-out.  To top it off, they overcharged me for the under-seat bag and when I went back in to get that corrected, it was a huge deal and wasn't even done right (2 bucks, even after the 10% discount  should have been $1.80 + tax back to me, somehow their cashiering system made that $1.85).

My inseam not even measured.

I know as a small business owner myself, that for every one vocalized complaint their are 20 silent dissatisfied customers out there. And I didn't want to complain on YELP.  She was apologetic and asked if Glen - her husband could call me back. Instead, later in the day I got a phone call from an employee, who told me that this was the first \""fit\"" complaint they had ever had and that the free fit was just a \""visual fit\"".

Everyone in the shop is very nice and quite personable, but they have a tendency to send bikes out the door without testing the repair anywhere but on a rack.  I suppose I should thank them for that, as it fills the first ride after a repair with challenges you never expected.  Take today for example.  I had Aspen Creek repair a broken ring derailleur cable, which they did in not time flat.  The interesting part of the ride was how my bike is now an automatic, shifting up or down randomly for no apparent reason and the chain noise was another nice element.  Usually this ride is pretty quiet, but I must say hearing that chain grinding across the front derailleur really made for a nice cadence guide.  I have to say the every time I have had a problem with a repair, with the exception of the initial set up, when my handle bars went one way and the front tire another (I fixed that after I made it through the intersection on my own) they have repaired their repair.

I figured why not, might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part, which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left, I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday, and if not I'd have it early next week.\n\nGreat!  I'm all excited, it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days, but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes, didn't get my bike on Friday, (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday, or Wednesday.  So on Thursday, I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold, late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work, I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \n\nYesterday, I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night, the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though, so I was very confused.  This morning, I'm on my way to work, just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.  A normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because I couldn't get proper power out of my bike.\n\nToday at 11, when the shop opened, I was their first customer.  I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way, I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\n\nLike I said at the top, I'll never go back...",0.0,0.9963282942771912

I had already shipped my bike to the FedEx on Forbes (much cheaper than checking it on my flight).  The FedEx guys were very nice, and let me reassemble my bike inside their store.\n\nSo I got my bike almost fully assembled - but then discovered  that I did not know how to reattach the brake cables.  You can't do a 360-mile ride without brakes!  Fortunately, before my trip I had googled to see if there was a bike shop nearby, just in case I needed emergency repairs.  So I thanked the FedEx guys, and walked my bike the several blocks to Iron City Bicycles.\n\nThey already had a backlog of repairs, and initially said that they couldn't look at my bike for another day or two.  But I had to be on the trail the next morning, and couldn't wait that long.  So Chris, one of the mechanics, quickly showed me how to reattach the brake cables.  \n\nHad I left at that point, I would have been in for a nasty surprise - because my front derailleur cable had been broken during shipment, and I hadn't noticed it.  But Chris did, and though he didn't have the proper cable housing in stock, he still managed to  get it repaired - and I didn't have any troubles with shifting over the entire five-day journey.  Initially he wasn't even going to charge me, but I insisted that he take something - so we settled on $8.  That would never happen in DC!\n\nWhile Chris was working on the cable, I got to chat with the owner about our respective experiences riding the Canal towpath.  He even gave me a fistful of ICB decals when I left, one of which now proudly adorns my bike's rear rack.\n\nA very cool shop, with helpful and friendly guys working in it.

After dropping our bikes off we were told it would take a week and a half, and they would call us.  They never called, I called them and was told the bikes had been ready for days.  Well, that would have been nice to know!  We went in and picked our bikes up.  In addition to not calling us when they were ready, when they rang us up the price came up to an extra $20 more than they had quoted us on the phone.  After I complained, they took it off, but they still did not seem very organized for a very expensive bike shop (we paid $190).\n\nWhat we got for our money was very disappointing.  The bikes seemed as if...well, as if nothing had been done other than the extra changes we had asked for.  We had each paid $50 for a tune-up (that was apparently impossible to opt-out of when coming in for a flat) and had been reassured that every bolt, gear, brake, etc would be checked.  I have had good tune-ups before and in my experience they are worth it, but with this one the bike really felt as if nothing had been done other than the minor changes I had paid extra for.  The bikes hadn't even been cleaned or lubed up.  \n\nIn addition to the tune-up seeming non-existent, my boyfriend's tires had not been pumped up all the way, his brake pads scraped against his tires, and my handlebars were too long and out of alignment with the wheel.\n\nA couple days after picking up our bikes, we went on a long bike ride.  First we stopped by Cycle Technique to get his tire's pumped up and our brakes adjusted.  We felt very rushed, they would barely let us speak before running off the computer to check if what we said matched up with the services we paid for (it did).  After that, we went off.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes my boyfriend's tire went flat!  Luckily we were right next to Ca Roule Montreal, and brought it in there.  In about 10 minutes the repairman there looked at the wheel and went through and pulled out about 6 sharp pieces of jagged metal.  Oh, I wonder why he got a flat!  They fixed the flat and sent us on our way, no problems since.\n\nSo in addition to being rushed, disorganized, expensive, and with a long wait, their $50 \""check every bolt\"" tune-up apparently isn't thorough enough to find sharp pieces of jagged metal in the wheel while you're changing the tire.\n\nOverall a bad experience.",0.0,0.9990065693855286

Such bikes can be rusty, slow and not especially good - the last thing you want to be doing is buying a bike with dodgy brakes and in risk of breaking.  Thankfully, there is a solution; Bike Station sells not only cheap, but also high quality bikes (they'll also recycle any unwanted bike you have but don't want) - in this respect they cannot be faulted.  After my last second hand bike fell apart after just a few months use I was about to give up on second hand bikes, but the quality here is first class and still very good value.  \n\nUpon arriving at Bike Station, you'll see a sign in the street pointing you into a small car park.  Here, in what is really just a glorified garage you'll find Bike Station.  On Saturdays (Fridays for kids bikes) from 10:30 till 4:30 you can buy second hand bikes and on Wednesdays 4pm till 8pm and Saturdays 12pm to 4pm you can hire a work stand for \u00a34 to fix your own bike.  Throughout all these three times you can also buy second hand parts.  \n\nIn short, this place is well worth a visit, whether you are a bike lover wanting to mend your bike or someone who just wants a second hand bike that won't break.  The service here is excellent and the quality cannot be faulted - if only all second hand bike sellers were this good I wouldn't have spent money on a bike that's now broken.",1.0,0.9896922707557678

I first came at lunchtime in mid-September, only to hear that the students had been queuing outside each morning at 10am when it opened to snatch up all of the just-completed bikes.

The store is the same as every other REI I have shopped at, full of toys, some over prices, some not. Standard. But the bike shop is a place to be wary of. I brought my mountain bike in to have it tuned and the rear wheel trued. Paperwork filled out, I left the bike with the promise it would be done in a couple days. That night I received a phone call from the store's head mechanic. He had bad news, the bike would need a overhaul - an additional $100 bucks on top of the tune- plus a new rear wheel. Now, I have put several hundred miles on the bike so neither sounded outlandish, so I gave him the green light. Later in the week I received another call, this time I needed a new rear derailleur, rear shock, and bottom bracket, all of which he could easily order for me. Convenient. Short on cash, and now suspicious of the mechanic's true motivation - particularly after I had replaced the BB just a month prior - I declined. Later, I received the final call that the bike was ready, and I drove in to pick it up. Of course the mechanic was \""out for the day\"" - he was always out - so I did not notice that he had put my rear shock on backwards, failed to fill it with air, failed to properly tune the rear derailleur, and had cut a much to long piece of tubing for the front brake. \n\nI have yet to find a good bike mechanic in Vegas, but be warned that this guy is in the business of selling new parts, not fixing bikes.",0.0,0.9993882179260254

What I found was the gorgeous bike I saw online that I had been drooling over, and Debbie, the best sales rep ever. \n\nEvery type of bike and their pros and cons were explained to me, without hesitation or impatience and without feeling like I was a burden. Any question I had was answered nicely and with a real explanation rather than trying to blow me off by telling me some made up answer that I wouldn't catch on to. \n\nI was told I could put a down payment on a bike and pay it off in 3 months. Also, if it ended up I didn't want it, I'd get my money back. Really? this is too good to be true, yet I said I'd have to think on it. \n\nI ended up putting a deposit down the next day over the phone with Debbie and she was so nice. She asked me when I would be in to visit my bike again, which I just died over. How cute is that? That's exactly how *I* think!!\n\nOn the say I arrived to get my bike I asked a few more questions about the bike such as whether I could put different tires on and some other features of the bike. Debbie then walked me through and helped me get all the accessories I wanted and needed as well as spent the time really explaining the difference between items and why I needed them. On my final checkout I received 10% off of EVERYTHING. \n\nWith free classes and amazing service, I truly lucked out finding my dream bike at a dream store.

He FAILED to mention a restocking fee which comes into play later...... \n\nA different associate loaded the bike into my truck for me and I brought it to a friends house to stash it until our Anniversary. It was then he noticed a few scratches I hadn't seen. Upon calling the store they made it seem like it was no problem to bring it in and exchange the bike or touch up the paint. Hey, it's a gift so it should look perfect when you're presenting it brand new right?\n\nProblem was, once the bike was brought down to the store, the associate was NO help. He said he couldn't fix the paint because he didn't have the right color, couldn't exchange it because there wasn't another one, and suggested using a sharpie.....you heard me right. Oh, and if you return the bike they wanted some 20% re-stocking fee for them to put it back on the rack.

But why weren't we having these issues before they touched our bikes the first time? We agreed to have them perform maintenance and true the wheels.

A percentage goes to the pedicab company and the rest the cyclist gets to keep. (at least I think that's how it works). Considering most of the clientele are drunk they can be easier to charge the high prices for their ride (compared to black cabs for example).

I was on Craigslist and thought I'd get more info on different features on different bikes. So I went into Mcghie's. They happened to have two Gary Fisher Matching mountain bikes in our sizes. They were used bikes they used to rent out for bike rentals. I bought them at a good price, comparable to used bikes of this type on Craigslist. Except these came with a one year warranty from Mcghie's. I liked that they are a family run business and stand behind their customers. Even with used bikes. 8 months into ownership of my bike, a front shock started to leak. I brought it in and they told me that some seepage is normal, but to keep an eye on it, and I took the bike home. Five months later, I noticed it was still leaking. I took it back in. By this time, the bike was one month out of warranty. But they remembered I had brought it in initially months before, within warranty. They took in the bike, sent out the front shocks to Fox for reseal. They called me to come pick it up when it was done. No charge. I want to say thanks To Chris P for his thorough knowledge of bikes in general. He was a great salesman and helped me through the whole process. I also want to thank Ben, the general manager of the store. He was the guy who represented McGhie's and their outstanding customer service by taking care of my bike and standing behind the sale.

I had already been to two other bike shops in Edinburgh, both independents, and hadn't found *my* bike. None just felt right.\n\nBut even on a Sunday, when the stock was low at Evans, they had the perfect bike for me. A sexy little number, in red, hybrid with two sets of gears and a white seat and a little bell. The customer service was really good, they let me test the bike no bother, and when we pushed them to have the alts done by 2.30pm (with only an hour of work-time) as we were pushed for time, the guy hurried it through for us.\n\nAdmittedly some of the stock is really quite expensive compared to other places. So I held off buying my bag and padlock from here. But for the bike itself, Evans have a great range and good customer service to go. No rushing, no pushing onto one bike or another (I was torn between a hybrid and a road bike). Although newbies be warned (as I am a newbie) - most bike shops like to keep the seat higher than you might need as it's good for the legs and you can get more push and it's general better bike-riding But as a noob I need my seat low, lower, noooo lower. So don't be afraid to keep asking them to adjust it till it's the perfect fit for you.\n\nTHere's also a free check-over the bike in 6 weeks time, and they run a 'how to care for your bike' class once a month. Very happy Jen *ding ding*",1.0,0.9841994047164916

Our scheme had closed but I had noticed that our previous official supplier had been EBC so I had a look around their website and saw a fab bike on sale, with about 50% off.

If they have it in stock then you will have the option of even trying before you buy so taking it out on a test ride.

Honestly, I was a bit clueless about this and was basically like 'I know bikes get nicked a lot in Edinburgh so what's the best lock to try and prevent this and do you know how insuring the bike will work?' and they were so good at explaining it all to me and not taking the piss because I was a girl. I was able to collect my bike less than a week later as it came into the store really quickly. The guys in store also helped me pick out a new helmet (price range from \u00a330+) and advised on fit and lightness. I ended up back a third time to get a jacket. Again as the store is a bit warren like, I hadn't realised that they have a fab range of ladies clothing in the back of the store. It really is very good and this was the fourth bike shop I had been to that day in search of a jacket when I should have come back here first.  \n\nSo - this would be my first port of call now for anything bike related and I have already recommended them to loads of other people too as the service is THAT good!",1.0,0.5244835615158081

I believed the trade off would be that the dealer would have thoroughly gone through the bike before putting it for sale  (Oh so I should not need a second opinion from soemone else).\n\nI tried to test drive the bike before purchasing it, but the solid answer was no.  Under no circumstances do they let you test drive (OK I get the insurance issue, even though I have my own).  So I couldn't get a second opinion if I wanted to.\n\nI bought the bike anyways, as it was the one I had been looking for (2006 VFR800).  On my ride home the bike felt and sounded odd, but I had previously owned a cruiser, so maybe they are suppose to sound and feel like this and I just needed to get use to it. I rode it the next day and it just didn't seen right so I called the Apache dealer in Phoenix (I live in Phoenix not Mesa) and asked if they would just ride it around the block and tell me if the bike was running as it should.  They got me in the next day (2 days after purchase) and guess what the chain drive needed to be replaced.  That was the cause of the odd feel and sound.  Instead of them working with the Mesa store, I had to call the Mesa store and work with the sale guy to let him know of the issue and ask what he was going to do.  We talked, he called the Phoenix store to verify and asked if I wanted to bring it to Mesa or Phoenix to replace the chain drive (free of charge).  I scheduled it for the Phoenix dealer.  While they replaced the chain I also asked that they look over the entire bike as I was going on a 1500 mile trip with the new bike in 2 days.  They did and said nothing else was wrong.  \n\nWow, replacing the chain drive made a world of difference.\n\nLater that day I was talking with some biker friends and they asked if they changed the sprocket too.  I said no, why.  They explained that typically the sprocket is always changed at the same time.the chain is replaced.  So now I am nervious again,  I take it to another mechanic and have them do a once over to see if It needed anything.  Guess what...it did.  Some how both dealerships missed the fact that there was too much oil.  Not a little over but alot about a cup (He showed me).  So I had him drain it to an acceptable level.  Also the clutch fluid needed to be changed.  He said I could hold off until after my trip.\n\n Ok so I bought a used bike from a dealer who abviously doesn't / didn't  do a full inspection before selling it and I had to spend my time and money to correct things they should have done or told me about.\n\nI can't speak to the new bikes, but if you buy a used bike from these guys plan on spending more money to have it inspected again as they don't do a thorough job.",0.0,0.9992745518684388

The beach cruisers hurt my knees and so she directed us to a \""Giant\"" brand bike where the pedals were a little farther back. I was still unsure and she recommended I try riding it longer to see. So I purchased the bike and a basket, and took it home and rode it around a little bit. The basket clinks against the bike rod (it doesn't fit correctly with the shape of the bike), and the bike still hurts my knees so we went back two days later to see about a trade-in or return, and she told us all sales were final. \n\nI expressed to her that it is bad business to have an \""all sales final\"" without putting up signage, and also without even telling the customer at the time of purchase.

Shotty work, when I tested the breaks and the gears, they lost all tension because screws were not tightened.  I thought I could take the easy route and not rebuild the bike myself.. now I'm out money and I have a bigger project than before.  Thanks Paragon!",0.0,0.9982946515083312

Very noticeable difference in the shifting and motor.  I rode all day long the day after I got it back and it was like a new bike! \n\nSince my bike ran so well after taking it to them. I gave them 3 stars. This would have been a 5 star review except for a few things. The turnaround time was longer then I expected. I called the day after taking the scooter to them and they said they found the issue and would be ordering the part from San Diego. I assumed the part would arrive in a day but took 2-3 days. Keep in mind this could have been a shipping issue, I am not 100% sure what the hold up was, but I expected to have my bike back on a Wednesday and picked it up on Friday. I dropped it off the previous Friday afternoon. \nMy scooter is my main form of transit, so this is kind of a big deal to me. \n\nSecondly, when I got the bike back my back blinkers were not working. Scott rode all the way out to my place, across town in Silverado Ranch to fix this for me. I thought that was pretty awesome and it was the right thing to do. So even though I was not too thrilled with using hand signals right after getting my scooter back, they did more then make it right by coming out to me to address this. \n\nLastly, I was misquoted on the price. The cost of the repair was $50 more then I was originally quoted because they forgot to add the in cost of the part. Had a not noticed and asked them about this, I would have gotten a little added bonus. However, I am an honest person so we got squared away with the bill and I was just happy I had a working bike. \n\nDyno Tech came recommended to me by someone I know who has the same type of scooter.
