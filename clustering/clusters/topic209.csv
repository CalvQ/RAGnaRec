Popcorn Girl has an incredible variety of flavors, and really good quality corn. I even took a picture of the Garrett popcorn and Popcorn Girl popcorn side-by-side on the same blue plate (see photos) to show how identical the kernels are. If I had to guess, they get their corn from the same farm/distributor! \n\nIt was fun trying the different kinds of Popcorn Girl flavors and the tastes got more interesting as different flavors were eaten in sequence with others. One sweet kernel, one salty, one hot, another sweet one, etc. It was HARD deciding on which bags to get, I ended up choosing a caramel bag and a smoky BBQ bag. I chose smoky BBQ because I liked the sample - it was one of their special flavors of the week.\n\nGarrett Popcorn in Chicago has been the benchmark for caramel and cheese flavored popcorn since I was 5 yrs old. (I grew up in Michigan). When the opportunity came to taste Popcorn Giri caramel side-by-side with Garrett's CaramelCrisp I got excited.\n\nAnd the winner is...\nWith the kernels virtually identical in size, texture and shape (see photo) it really came down to preference of the caramel coating. The Popcorn Girl caramel coating is sweeter and more candy-like, and the Garrett caramel coating is more buttery and toffee-like. Popcorn Girl's caramel corn seemed to stick to my teeth a smidge more than Garrett's. Garrett's had that \""this can't be good for you\"" aftertaste, conjuring visions of Chris Farley on 90s SNL pounding his sausage-eating chest during the Chicago Bears sketches.

You charge enough for the popcorn, the very LEAST that you could do as a business is have accurate printed menus.  Not being catty here, these are the same menus they have been handing out since October.

I drove 30 minutes with my 13 month old daughter and was planning to buy lots of popcorn for my family and some for friends.  I was a little disappointed in the popcorn because it tasted stale and wasn't of the quality I am used to with Uptown Popcorn that I went to in Dallas.  I was still going to buy some because we drove all this way but the kicker was when she wouldn't allow me to try another flavor.  You only get two samples, folks.  Seriously, when planning on buying 5 or 6 bags of different popcorn and not being allowed to taste the popcorn you are interested in buying....crazy, bad business.  I could not in good conscience buy any of the popcorn so we left empty handed and they lost a new customer, which judging by the location and empty store, they cannot afford to do.  She made it sound like it was a real treat to be able to taste any of their popcorn as other places do not let you taste at all.  I wondered if she could name a place that didn't.  I have gone to ice cream stores, popcorn places, etc.  When I go to Dean and Deluca or Whole Foods and am allowed to try anything I want as many times as I want, I am reminded of good customer service and a way to run a business.  We are talking about popcorn, 2 or 3 kernels tops, I really don't think it is breaking the bank to let your customers try the popcorn.  I would rethink your business plan, Tastebuds Popcorn!

They were friendly although it was obvious that I was one of the first customers, so it took longer than necessary to package up my small bag of kettle corn.  The customer before me appeared to have been waiting awhile on her large bag of Puppy Chow (which looked pretty amazing).  The kettle corn I ordered was just the right balance of sweet and salty.  I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!\n\nI took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $1 to $149.95.

I've tried 7 of their flavors so far and have been pretty impressed with all of them. They have a way of packing so much flavor into their popcorn that when you bite into each kernel, it's like a little flavor explosion goes off in your mouth. Here's a little breakdown of the flavors I've tried so far:\n\nBeer Cheddar - Holy Hell. Top ten things I've ever put in my mouth. Beer and Cheese in popcorn? You gotta be kidding. Ridiculously good. \n\nJalapeno Cheddar - Not too spicy, a real nice soft Jalapeno flavor. Very good.\n\nDill Pickle - Super flavorful pickle flavor. If you like dill pickles, you'll like this.\n\nSpicy Carmel - Really interesting to have a slightly spicy twist on the normal sweet carmel flavor. Another winner.\n\nKettle - They got just the right mix of sweet and salty, one of the better Kettle popcorns I've tried.\n\nSpicy Buffalo Wings - Woah, spicy! I like that something labeled spicy is actually genuinely spicy for a change. Amazing flavor on this one as well, but only try this if you can handle a good amount of spice.\n\nMeyer Lemon - Good Lemon flavor. I'm not a big fan of sweet candy'ish popcorn like this, so it wasn't my thing...but if you are into sweeter popcorn you'd probably love this.\n\nOverall, this is an awesome new local business that you need to check out if you're in the area. I'm already pretty much addicted to it. My new pre-movie routine will now consist of getting a really good bag of popcorn here and taking it to the movie theater with me. Can't beat getting a decent size bag of high quality popcorn here for about the same price that you'd pay for the inconsistent stuff at the movies. \n\n4.5/5 stars.",1.0,0.9969723224639891

Popcorn.  Many, many flavors of popcorn.  Sweet, savory.  Chocolate, nuts.  Buttery, salty.  All of it.  And MPK does it well.  I love that they offer mini bags ranging from $2-$6.  Forced portion control.  If I was given a barrel of popcorn, I would somehow manage to get it down.\n\nSo why only 3 stars?  Less than impressive customer service.  Now the lady at the front (owner?) is great.  Very helpful and friendly.  The girls in the back...not so great.  I was in before Christmas to buy 13 mini bags...all different.  Although there were numerous people in the back, there seemed to be more socializing than actual work going on.  It took a good 20 minutes or so to get my order ready.  I could have eaten the product faster than they packed it.  No worries.  The shop is fun to browse.  But when my order was finally ready and I was heading out the door, an employee came out with a bag that they had missed.  At this point, I knew they probably did not bother to double check my order, so I did it when I got to my car.  Even with the bag they missed, I was still missing one...a $6 bag at that.\n\nAgain, the lady at the front was very apologetic, but the gal working in the back was argumentative as she \""knew\"" she had packed that particular flavor.  She came out front to get my entire bag, so that she could go through it herself and see what was missed.  Apparently, I am both a liar, illiterate, and unable to count to 13.  So now I'm waiting again with nothing to do but wonder why they didn't do this before they gave me the order.  Finally, she was sufficiently convinced the missing bag was, indeed, missing.  Upon returning my order, she remarked it had been packed, but not given to me.\n\nI still might not have dropped my rating if not for the fact that while I was waiting for the sleuth in the back to solve her case, another customer came in complaining that she was missing 5 bags of her 20 bag order.  Unfortunately for her, the order was for an office function that had already taken place.\n\nSo moral of my long-winded review is to give MPK a shot if you're a popcorn lover, but make sure you check your order before you leave.

Salty and sweet, the flavors of this transcendental  'corn'ucopia of brilliantly popped and expertly-flavored corn all work together like peanut butter and jelly, like yin and yang, like Bonnie and Clyde, like rock & roll. \n\nYes it's probably one of the more expensive popcorns you can buy outside of a movie theater, but you're not purchasing just popcorn.... you're buying an unforgettable drug-like experience that will leave you craving for more. And more. And more.",1.0,0.9985596537590028

I tried their signature flavor, The Garrett Mix (formerly Chicago Mix I believe): a blend of cheddar & caramel popcorn. They do offer samples & you can customize a mix, like swap out regular cheddar for spicy cheddar for the Garrett Mix as an example.\n\nFlavor is awesome but I did not care for the texture. If you're used to eating freshly popped kettle corn that has that light as air crispy texture you will not get that here. I know it's like comparing apples to oranges but I think all the heavy coating of the cheese and caramel bogs down the popcorn even though they use a high grade, premium \""mushroom\"" kernel.\n\nFreshness level decreases the moment you open the bag and progressively gets worse with each passing day. If you can get it into a sealed container immediately after purchase I'm sure it'll stay fresh longer. But as a tourist you know that's not gonna happen. In all fairness the packaging does tell you to eat it right away, but their small size is rather huge. And they do fill the bag to the top & package it up in a way that evokes memories of excessive Japanese packaging. So the pricing is justified.\n\nIf they had smaller portions I would definitely try something else next time. Maybe, just maybe.\n\nTIP: For AAA members show your membership card at the Miracle Mile Shops Customer Service Counter to get the Mall's complimentary coupon booklet.

She must have done this with 5 plus different flavors. Mind you, when I first walked in she did not wash her hands (like how they do at Subway or Golden Spoon, you actually see the employee wash their hands in front of you).

They arrange all six types and include all flavors underneath each type. The lowest price type being those in the original heading and the highest being those under the chocolate heading. The price also varies according to the bag size, box, or tin as they also offer gift giving options.

The others tend to be bit more chewy.
