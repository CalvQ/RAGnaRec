He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him, he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.\n\nI called Restaurant.com for a refund, and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.

Either way, it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.\n\nBeyond this problem, I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.

Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it.

And if your thinking about doing the same you might want to read this review to make sure you dont feel duped after you get your bill. \nThe location of the restaurant is very  much out of the way and in a not so desirable location either but sometimes this is where you get the best food. Walking into the place the staff was very friendly and helpful. I have high expectations of German food from a place i use to frequent back home and this was lacking in a few areas. As the dining room was kind of unwelcoming with the way it was setup with glass cases of countless items on display for sale. I feel like if im paying $30 a plate for dinner that i would like to eat in a dining room at the least, instead i felt like i was sitting in a pawn shop. Lets get to the food split pea soup was tasty, bread dumplings were just ok lacking in flavor a bit, the schnitzel was good no doubt and the spaetzle was just ok. The entire mean was kind of ho hum and nothing to really write home about, although i would have gone back except for what happen when i received my bill. \nI did what Restaurants.Com suggests in trying sides, and higher priced dishes because you have your gift certificate. This is where the extra split pea soup and dumplings are ordered which i wouldnt usually do because i already know my portion is going to be huge and fill me up. Most all certificates on Restaurants.Com suggest that anywhere from a 15-20% gratuity is auto added to your bill and i personally am not a fan of this as i should be able to tip my server based on performance and is partially why i even got the Cafe Heidelburg certificate in the first place. So a bill for dinner for two came out to $64 for dinner and two sides and that was AFTER the use of my $25 gift certificate. This was partially because the waitress decided she was going to add 20% for herself regardless if my certificate disclosed that or not. That means that im almost at $90 total bill ($64 + $25= $89) to eat in a pawn shop, and have mediocre food at best. I will not return as this is ridiculous, there are far too many great restaurants where i can have dinner for two for $90 and you feel like it was worth it. $28 dinners for this place? If your even in Seaside, CA go to Stammtisch and enjoy your dinner, service and atmosphere and spend half that. http://www.yelp.com/biz/stammtisch-restaurant-seaside",0.0,0.9946216344833374

The place itself is ok. About 3 stars for ambiance.\n\nThere were definitely numerous menu options that sounded delicious. But the specials menu had a mushroom ravioli with black truffles - and how can you pass THAT up? There was both an appetizer portion and an entree portion. Given that I tend to almost never be able to finish an entire plate of anything, I opted for the appetizer portion (as my entree, of course).\n\nOur entrees arrived super fast. SUPER fast. Ridiculously fast. Did they somehow already know what we were going to order and have it ready for us?

And such quick service would be very handy if going to a show or something afterward. 4 stars for the entrees.\n\nFor dessert, we opted to share the mango creme brulee. It also came out quite fast. And it was quite tasty. The mango was a little bit overpowering and tart, but the kiwi sorbet and crunchy brulee provided a good balance. 3.5 stars.\n\nThe service was great. Very knowledgeable, thorough, and fast. The only slight issue came when I produced the restaurant.com gift certificate. The waiter tried to tell me that we couldn't use it unless we had two entrees (and, of course, I opted for the appetizer portion, instead of the entree portion). However, the gift certificate clearly stated \""$35 minimum purchase\"" and NOT \""two entrees\"" (which a lot of other restaurant.com gift certificates do say). So he then went to ask someone somewhere about it. You would think it would take longer to whip up some mushroom ravioli than it would to inquire about a gift certificate, but not so. We seriously spent more time waiting re: the gift certificate than the entire time it took for the actual meal. And yeah, that was annoying. But the waiter did finally come back and let us know that all was ok. Apparently, he was just thrown for a loop because the newer restaurant.com gift certificates for Valentino do require the purchase of two entrees. So I'll be nice and say 4 stars for service, despite the gift certificate glitch.\n\nOverall, a pleasant dining experience with some great food.",1.0,0.9924881458282472

What a mistake ! The waiter's main interest was \""upselling\"" us before we ate. We told him we don't drink alcohol but he asked us 3 times if we wanted \""something to drink\"" and proceeded to name every beverage that costs money. My wife ordered the seafood dish of salmon and it came undercooked. The waiter admonished her that \""every restaurant cooks it this way so you should be ordering it well done.\"" Really... I have to order fish well done at Lawrys. (Talking to us like we don't eat out very often when in fact he probably only can eat out there, on his shift break. Funny dude). When the \""silver cart\"" came for my prime rib I ordered the small cut thinking that for $35 I would get a decent size piece of prime rib. Wrong !! The one piece i received was small and about 25% of it was fat. It was really tasty but $34 for that and some mashed potatoes ? Really ? Of course we had to politely refuse his requests for us to buy some side dishes as well. Bottom line is the food was tasty except for the fish being undercooked which they corrected. The waiter was attentive but always looking for us to buy something more then we wanted. Food OVERPRICED to the point where we felt stupid for sitting there with all these huge parties of people that are obviously there on business. Very few couples in the dining room. We tipped 15% because we didn't want to rip off all the others that depend on our tip ie busboys, bartenders, hostess etc.  For the comment he made to my wife he deserved NOTHING. Don't waste your money here when you can go almost ANYWHERE else for $74, (total before we used gift certificate), and get a great meal.",0.0,0.995149552822113

I didn't care for them but my boyfriend said they were okay so we just left it alone. \nFor our meals I ordered the chopped steak and he ordered the chicken friend steak with the potato cakes on the side.

It was really tasty, but I just wish there was more because most of my meal was dry. The cfs was okay also. My favorite part of his meal was the potato cakes.

We asked for the owner to come out and he proceeded to yell at me and argue for a good 5 minutes as to why he wont accept it. He even asked who gave it to me and what was her name, as if I remember from January! I told him whatever empoyee he had at that time! I asked him where my $20 went then in January? He kept saying they dont do certificates. I asked him if I then had gone behind the register to write myself my own gift certificate from his restaurant back in January? He still argued with me then told his waitress to tell us he would call the cops if we didnt pay the full bill. So my sister got her phone out and started dialing and the waitress came back out to us and said he'd finally \""agreed\"" to let us use it. Keep in mind, we ONLY had 2 pastrami sandwiches and 2 sodas and the bill was $32!! Service was horrible and it's wayyy too pricey for just 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks.

They USED to be awesome. Now, the food is mediocre at best, it is way too pricey now and as of today, we will NEVER come back again.

He said they don't offer gift cert's. Well, one of his employee's obviously sold one and we had every right to use it. There is no expiration date on it, no limitations, and it clearly shows that $20 was paid. He still not only refused, but started arguing and then YELLING at my sister. I couldn't believe it. To top it off, he threatened to call the police!!! I handed him my phone and told him to go ahead, but he eventually changed his mind, stopped his yelling and accepted the gift cert. I have never seen any customer anywhere treated so horribly. I was completely blown away. And I can say that we have had our last pastrami sandwich from there.....EVER. This man does not deserve to be in business.\nAnd let's not forget about the waitress.  Even tho she was much more pleasant than the manager, she was quite sneaky and we were not happy with that at all.  We asked how much it would cost for extra meat on our sandwiches and she told us 50 cents, so we ordered it.  We also asked for the dressing that USED to come with the sandwiches.  When we get the bill, we see it's $3.00 for the extra meat....per sandwich!!!  And $1.25 for the dressing....per sandwich!!!  She never came to us and told us this before adding it to the bill.  She just did it.  And then, during the gift cert fiasco, she tried to calm the situation by saying she will take care of the gift cert and charge my sisters credit card for the remaining balance, nearly $12 (that's right, $32 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas!!!)  She came back and had charged the FULL $32 to my sisters card, saying she wasn't able to close the ticket unless she charged the full amount.

Both husband and wife came to our table separately to chat. The other wait staff was ok, friendly but not out of the ordinary. Since bread usually comes first ... I have to say I was a bit disappointed being used to the piping hot loaves at Carabbas, or or other places that have a variety of rolls. These were like ordinary sliced white bread without much flavor. The specials sounded good but the server didn't give the prices till I asked specifically. MH was surprised not to see Corona in the beer selections. He also wanted the filet mignon which they were out of. He settled for the sole (which was good he said) and I had the Chicken Caprese special, but I had to make a special request to get basil included. Which seemed a bit counter intuitive but anyway. I wasn't crazy about it, or the wine sauce it came in. What I really wish had been different was the fact that it didn't come with pasta, but potatoes and vegetables. Not what I'd expect at an Italian restaurant. Sure, if it was a choice ... but it wasn't. Oh, and I didn't see pesto or alfredo sauce anywhere in the menu. Suffice it to say the owners are very nice but even that may not be enough to get me back. I like being excited over leftovers and tonight I'm just not. I did get a piece of cheesecake to bring home.

They apologized profusely and offered a glass of wine on the house. This was kind of them though I was not impressed with their wine menu. I am not a wine expert at all but when you've got Sutter Home at $8 per glass it does make me wonder... I ordered a caesar salad to start which was made table side and then had the raspberry duck. Both were delicious and they redeemed themselves on the starter and entree. Then we ordered bananas foster for dessert which was made table side like the salad and the portion was huge but very delicious. I wish I had more room to eat it!

It was the 13th of the month which is the day of the month when they have extra super deals on certain things.  For example a few entrees were $13 and your second bottle of wine is 13 cents.  It was pretty busy and loud but we were seated right away and our waitress was fast and friendly.  Food was also delivered relatively quickly.\n\nAll the other tables around us were offered bread to start but we weren't asked and none was given to us which ticked me off.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a 2nd because, hey it's only 13 cents.  Then, for an appetizer we shared the calamari.  It was very good and perfect to share even though I could have eaten it all myself.  I loved the spicy sauce stuff.  I ordered the wedge salad for myself and it was not very good.  Well, it could have been very good had the thing not been warm.  They must of had the lettuce and other toppings out of the fridge for a few hours.  Bummer.  For my main entree I ordered the burger and it was excellent.  I loved the toppings and the burger itself was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the plain fries and they were just ok.  Nothing special.  I should have ordered the sweet potato fries or chips instead.\n\nThe only thing that seriously pissed me off was that our waitress refused to honor my gift certificate.  I was going to start a fight, but I was with friends and didn't want to be rude.  Instead I'm taking to Yelp to vent my frustrations.  Anyway, I sort of understand why I cannot use a coupon for happy hour stuff or a 13 cent bottle of wine.  What I don't understand is why I can't use my gift certificate for the other 80% of the bill which came from full price items?\n\nI've purchased about 20 gift certificates over the years from Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and this was the only place to give me a problem.  So, while I do highly recommend getting one, be prepared for a fight.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good meal and a solid neighborhood spot.

I had a gift card for this restaurant that I picked out as a reward from work. Came at lunch with my fam of 5, my parents and Aunty. \n\nFirst off we were the only customers and service took way too long. If it was super busy I'd understand....My dad(not the pickiest eater) actually complained that his soup was too salty. They took it away but didn't return it with another or say sorry or anything. It was awhile back but the food was not memorable at all. \n\nWorst part about the visit was they told me the card couldn't be used this time. Every single time I and my co-workers used this type of gift card we Never had a problem. They had this long explanation that it had to be mailed and next visit they would honor the discount yada yada yada and some other confusing stuff. \n\nAnywho I just wanted to get this bad visit (service and food) off my chest. Unfortunately after all this time still not forgotten. Hopefully I can move on. Bad on me I didn't question the gift card issue more(although and at least we spoke to manager at the time). And demand a new soup for my dad. A bad but learning experience nonetheless.",0.0,0.9833382368087769

Only ate half the dish. We ordered the brownie for dessert. It is NOT a brownie, it's a piece of cake. I don't know if they ran out of brownies, or that's their brownie. But we were very disappointed with that. We ordered extra ice cream to go with it. That came separately just as we finished the dessert - thanks.

Warning:  They do not accept all coupons.  Even though on the \""new\"" certificates it clearly states that it excludes brunch the old certificates (that are valid for 1 year from date of purchase) do not have this exclusion.  When the waiter told us the news, the manager admitted that she knew this didn't have the exclusion but that the \""restaurant reserves the right not to accept the certificate\"".  She was downright rude!  We have a $75 certificate for dinner and will absolutely NOT be using it ... and I would ask before you dine if they will accept the certificate as it wasn't said in words but implied that they reserve the same right for dinner.  So just some words of warning.\n\nAs for the waiter, he was great - very friendly and perfect service.\nAs for the food, was good brunch for $29.95/pp.  Made-to-order omelettes, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, crab.  Pretty typical stuff, good quality but nothing that most buffets don't have.  Did include all-you-can-drink mimosa's, wine and bloody mary bar though.\n\nHate to give anywhere 1 star, but think its just bad business to not honor a certificate / coupon that you well know is in circulation.

They won't take it. So yeah, I've had it forever and always forgot to bring it with me but that's beside the point - it says \""NO EXPIRATION\""!!! So starting off on the wrong foot, we stood in the doorway for a while until I chased down a waitress to ask where we could sit. The patio and bar were full and only one table was available inside. We sat and were quickly attended to by a great server (Eddie) who was obviously super busy but never once ignored us. The food was so-so; I remember it being better in the past when this place was not nearly as busy. The calamari was a bit soggy but decent tasting and the rock shrimp tempura was slightly soggy as well but OUT OF THIS WORLD in flavor! All of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo. You think I kid; I don't. And honestly, something tasted off, not super fishy but like the Hamachi had been previously frozen for a month and wasn't fresh? Unfortunately Tammy wasn't behind the bar so I didn't stop to piss and moan and make a scene but had she been there and had a moment to chat (like she has in the past) I probably would have said something. Even though I really want to give this place 1 star for tonight's several moments of WTF, Eddie was a killer attentive server, the food was expeditiously prepared, I think Tammy is a cool chick, and the all-day happy hour and sushi costs can't be beat anywhere in this state. I used to think Pearl was a underrated, hidden gem but apparently some of the quality has suffered with the increase in business. Too bad, now it's just a place you can say \""you get what you pay for\"" and that is truly unfortunate.",0.0,0.9660404324531556
