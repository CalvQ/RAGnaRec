We don't know anything about accounting, that's why we hire an accountant.  Then we are asked to put down a $300 retainer like they don't trust we'll pay the money to get the work done.  Then once retainer is paid, we are put on the backburner and ignored and sent bills for over $1000 over the next few months just to get our year end taxes done!  Then we ask to have help closing the business out with the government and are made promises that everything will be completed.  Now 6 months later, my wife had every penny (thousands) taken from her account by the state because nothing was ever done and the state is still charging my wife Unemployment Insurance taxes ($2000+) that she doesn't actually owe because the business was closed in February!  Guess what, Sorge said they'd fix it for us if we paid a $300 retainer again!",0.0,0.9995328187942504

I'm a really low maintenance client. I carefully keep and organize all of my tax stuff (receipts, forms, etc) and then once a year deliver them to his office. The only time I really ever talk with him or his team is when he calls after completing my taxes to let me know what the outcome is. He's been friendly and and enjoyable to talk with on the few occasions we've talked.\n\nHe's done a good job, though I've never had a CPA before so I base that only on the fact that my return is better than when I did it myself using Turbo Tax. I have noticed that my costs for his services have gone up several hundred dollars over the past few years but I understand there's a price to pay for good service so I've never complained about paying $700+ each time.\n\nThis year (2011) for the first time in the 4 or 5 year history of using Capital Accounting's services I needed Jim's team to go above and beyond and file my taxes immediately. I sat with him during the first week of February and personally explained that I was at risk of losing my entire return ($8K) if he didnt file so that I received the return prior to the end of the month. I was very detailed in my explanation and he explained that the IRS needed to update some files that would not be available until Feb 14th but that he would file my returns on the very next day (Feb 15th). Since that was the best that could be done, I agreed, thanked him and shared my appreciation.\n\nOn Feb 15th (Tues) I called his office to ensure he had everything he needed to file and to verify that it would be done that day. I left a message with a woman who answered the phone. She assured me they had everything and would call immediately if not. I heard nothing from them so I called back on Friday (18th) just to make sure. \n\nTo my disappointment, I recieved a call from Jim later that day asking me to remind him why I needed them filed on the 15th. My heart sank. I couldnt believe my ears. He hadn't filed my taxes, they were just going out on the 18th and I wasnt going to receive the return until March. All of it lost. Every single penny of that $8k is lost. \n\nThis is no way to treat customers on the ONE occassion when they ask you to do a little more than usual. The cost to use Capital Accounting's services to file my taxes? Over $8K, plus I imagine he'll even submit an invoice for his time. Talk about a disaster.",0.0,0.9349992871284484

In addition, he answered a lot of questions about my goal of early retirement, and gave me great guidance about how to structure my finances for a stable flow of income.  He analyzed the issue of when to take Social Security (and the answer can be different for all of us, based on dozens of different factors), and set me on the right track there.  He's also available during the course of the year for many what-if questions:  \n\n1) Should I refinance my mortgage?\n2) Is it better to just make additional payments in order to retire it sooner?\n3) At what point is the standard deduction greater than my mortgage interest?\n4) How much can I earn and not lose any of my Social Security when I'm under 66?\n5) When and how does my Social Security become taxable based on other income?\n6) For additional retirement income, do I draw on taxable or non-taxable IRAs first?\n7) Should I open a regular or a Roth IRA this year?\n8) When should I consider converting some/all of a regular IRA to a Roth?\n9) When can I reasonably afford to retire?\n\nYou get the idea--so many financial decisions today can have a lot of impact on a person's overall situation.

When we first were referred to her, I had a stack of questions and a box of receipts and miscellaneous paperwork, and a huge headache and anxiety around filing our business taxes. She helped me to get a handle on our taxes and make adjustments for the future. Tiffany is incredibly knowledgable, kind, organized, and thorough: all of the qualities you need in an accountant. Aside from accounting questions, she also has a wealth of information and resources for small business owners. I cannot recommend Sapphire Bookkeeping and Accounting enough.

They had a great website and the owner, Jason, had a very dynamic personality said he was an 'Enrolled Agent with the IRS, etc. Seemed good. \n\nMy first clue should have been they were more concerned about getting their first check, than they were about the information needed to create the bookkeeping and tax files. Months would go by without hearing from them and when you'd send an email, there would be no response. When you called, they would say there was an 'email problem' and to send it to a different email address. Then there was always an excuse for not replying; \""I'm traveling.\"", \""I'm not in the office\"", \""I'll have ____ check on it\"", etc.\n\nTax times rolls around and the owner brags, \""All businesses wait until October to file their taxes, I've already put yours on an extension.\""  Great! Then I got calls from my folks that said they hadn't received their 1099's. The office couldn't find the information, so I resent. I gave them numerous documents to work on bookkeeping, and nothing ever got put in place.\n\nFinally, I called the IRS and asked if an extension had been filed? The answer? No, but we see someone TRIED to file an extension on June 17th.  Of course, when I called Total Business Solutions, Jason was 'traveling', but would get back to me the following week. I went into the office and asked for my tax documents. They handed me the same envelope I had given them and not one single letter or document with tax information had been opened.\n\nThe bottom line? I paid this company more than $3000 in less than 12 months and never received one item of work in return. IRS 1099's not filed, personal and business taxes not filed, no bookkeeping, no receivables/expenditures, nada. But they did deduct their monthly fee.\n\nI have subsequently found out there are several others with this experience.  Be very careful about hiring this business. If you do hire them, make sure you keep copies of all communication because chances are, you'll need it later for Court.",0.0,0.9981389045715332

I frantically needed a tax service to file 5 years of back taxes. David and his staff at IQTaxx made a believer out of me!! I filed my taxes within two weeks and had a minimal balance to the IRS. In comparison to the amount originally billed to me by the IRS the numbers don't compare. They go far and above the call of duty.
