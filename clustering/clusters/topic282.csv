I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing.\n\nIf I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again).

Was also told to go as early as possible because it tends to sell out quick and when it's gone it's gone.\n\nGiven that today was Sunday, I do enjoy lamb, and it was pretty early a buddy and i figured we give it a shot.\n\nThe roast plate comes with a few slices of lamb, a giant yorkshore pudding, peas, carrots, some kind of sour vinegarie dipping sauce, a pat of butter,a piece of deep fried potato and an additional bowl of gravy. \n\nThe lamb itself wasnt very gamey tasting and had a present rosemary flavor to it. The slices themselves were fairly meaty with some fat for flavor. Gravy did an excellent job complementing the meat. Peas and carrots were your average canned sweet peas, the carrots were boiled down to the point where they were soft but mostly lost all their sweet carrotie goodness. The potato was interesting. Seemed they boiled it first then deep fried it to give it flavor and a crispy shell, potatoes are good... Yorkshore pudding wasnt exactly my favorite but who cares? We're here for lamb and we had some lamb.\n\nOverall 10.95 is a bit pricey for the plate hence the three star instead of a four. If the slices were a bit thicker or maybe two more slices it would have been perfect and justifiable for the cost. In the end it was still a decent plate of lamb roast.",0.0,0.9819164872169496
