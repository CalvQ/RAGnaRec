They're no longer rude - they're actually really nice here now! We asked to sit in a different place, and the hostess smiled and was okay with that. The servers take the plates off the table must faster, and they don't neglect you anymore! Yaaay to not be neglected!!! \n\nFood is still food. It's a Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for, and you can't really complain. This is NOT a luxury casino buffet, this is a buffet off the strip. So if you're expecting some gourmet Chinese food, this place is not for you! You'll have the usual mediocre sushi bar, the cream cheese wontons, cream cheese baked green mussels (YUM!), etc etc etc. I like the food here, so I don't have anything to complain about. \n\nI'm definitely coming back here! This place has gotten better, and my tummy (and family) has left happy each time!\n\nP.S. Refillable drinks (includ. Thai Tea) is 0.95 more! WORTH IT, in my opinion!",1.0,0.996278703212738

Not as good as you're going to get at a more high-end restaurant--but pretty darn good. I really enjoyed the bread and the minestrone soup. The main course was a swiss and prosciutto  ravioli.

Lucky for them, I would say the food is a little bit better. We actually came here twice while we were in Vegas due convenience (when you don't want eating to get in the way of gambling). \nDuring to first stop I ordered the club sandwich. If you are ever here and order this make sure you are going to split it with someone, the sandwich is huge. As far as taste, it was decent, but it's hard to really judge when you have to eat it in pieces because it is physically impossible to eat the whole thing with one bite. The second trip here I wised up and split a pizza. It was a four cheese pizza and we added Italian sausage, onions and peppers. It was actually surprisingly good for a diner pizza. \nOur service was decent both times. I would say the food is a little pricey, but I guess you have to adjust your price scale when eating in Las Vegas.
