We hit FOS opening night 2014 and it was a blast. I was initially hesitant because of how few days the attraction is open -- only twice a week for a month -- and how reasonable the price was ($16 but you can get a $2 off coupon on their website).\n\nWe drove past the parking lot once but, once inside, checked out the pumpkins for sale and petting zoo set up. There were a lot of people congregated at the trampoline/race track and a handful of families entering the fun maze but it was nothing like the never-ending queues that seem to make up certain haunted houses. There is no fast pass option here so plan accordingly -- can't just throw money at a long wait here.\n\nThere were about three groups ahead of us when we got to the haunted maze entrance. They stagger your entrance time and, for us, it worked. We never came close to the group ahead of us, keeping the spooks fresh and unexpected. Don't know what their max group size is -- we had 4. \n\nNot going to drop any specifics about the haunt but it was very well done. Going through the corn is a whole other experience from the conventional haunted house. Yes -- it is a single path, not a maze -- but there are so many turns on the path that you are constantly \""in the moment\"" rather than the conventional walk-into-room-get-spooked-walk-out-of-the-room format. All in all, it wasn't the biggest (no fair attractions or food booths) but it was the best haunted house experience I've had in Phoenix.\n\nI'd recommend shoes since I wore flip flops and, though it says no running, you will get some startles that will have you almost pushing Jenny over in hopes of saving yourself (or, at least, I did).",1.0,0.982562780380249

If you can't scare someone like me, then something is wrong. I went with a friend the first friday night that it was open. The lines were so long and I felt like I was on a middle school field trip with all of the preteens running around. We went through one haunted house (there are 4 total) and left.\n\nKnowing that it was not Fear Farm's fault that it had attracted so many teeny boppers, we held onto our passes and returned on a Thursday night when the kiddies would be tucked into bed. MUCH BETTER. The lines weren't too long and we made it through the other 3 in a reasonable time. \n\nUnfortunately, the scare factor had not improved. I think I jumped once or twice the entire time and that was because there was a chainsaw next to my face, and as I mentioned, loud noises scare me! \n\nWeirdest part was that I got hit on THREE times by the monsters!!! Apparently I attract the creepy or something?

We went on a Saturday night and we were easily able to get through all of the attractions even though we didn't get there until 9:30 at night. \n\nI had seen some reviews of people complaining about there being too many teenagers, but honestly the teens were respectful and didn't seem to be a problem.  Plus there was a police presence along with a ton of staff. The entire event is really well organized. \n\nThe haunted houses were really well put together and the people working there did a great job selling it.  Several of the haunted houses are integrated with the massive corn field which was even more freaky.  Of all the haunted houses the only thing I encountered I wasn't fond off was this one small section that you had to go through a three foot tall tunnel so you could either crawl or scooch down which is really not comfortable. I heard quite a few people complaining as we were going through it.  But it was not very long so it wasn't enough to make me rate this place lower. \n\nThe only real down side is now my throat hurts from screaming so much... well....that and after leaving I was so paranoid about something jumping out at me that my cat jumped the shit out of me after I got home....

I remember waiting in the waiting room for the tour to start and an oddball in period costume stood behind my friend, grabbed his bum and made a disturbing groaning noise - I sincerely hope he was part of the performance as we didn't see him again after that. \n\nIn fact all the staff seemed to take quite a liking to my friend and he was the object of ridicule in pretty much every scenario throughout the dungeon. First of all he was accused of being a cross dresser in the initial court section where he was referred to as Margaret even though he couldn't look less like a Margaret if he tried.\n\nNext up he was told to bend over (don't worry, it's a family day out) in the torture chamber where he nearly came a cropper with some sinister looking objects of medieval torture. It was hilarious for me to watch him looking so embarressed but he took it all in good humour which is what the Edinburgh Dungeons is all about - it's just a laugh after all!\n\nAfter 20/30 minutes of laughing at my friend it was my turn to be ridiculed and I was called up to help an oddball \""dissect\"" a dummy where I recall having to pull out some sausage and a sandwich from the lifeless plastic dummy a rather bizarre experience but funny nonetheless.\n\nOverall, I can't say that I found any part of the dungeons remotely scary but it's an absolutely hilarious afternoon out and I can highly recommend it!

I feel immersed in an environment rather than as if I am walking through a haunted house.

Scary movies, haunted houses, ghost stories, you name it, I'm all over it. I actively seek out a good scare and don't mind paying for it. \n\nLast year me and some friends took advantage of the Sunday deal and went to the Nest when it was in Avondale. It was REALLY good, and I might say that it was the best haunted house I'd been to up until then. Since it was outdoors on a huge lot, it was a lot different than most of the inside/maze houses you're used to. \n\nTonight we drove down and I was kinda feeling the new local. The Nest is nestled in the back of Rawhide so you have to walk a little ways, but there were some photo ops/concession stands/games set up along the way. We saw the building and I was pretty excited to see what they would do with it this year. \n\n*Sidenote: there's no need to \""dress up\"" or wear high heels to a haunted house, I promise. There were tons of girls who looked like they just came from da club*\n\nNot to ruin anything for anyone, but rather than telling the story of Jacob Kell throughout the whole thing, there were 3 \""different\"" sections. After going through the first two,  I thought \""oh that was just a warm-up, they're really gonna do it big at the end\"". Nope. I feel that it had a lot of potential but that the actors were few and far between, there wasn't as many \""cool special effects\"" as last year, and there wasn't really a \""wow\"" factor. and ******SPOILER ALERT****** no chainsaw?! what haunted house doesn't have a chainsaw....c'mon\n\nAnyways, we walked out and our collective thought was \""that's it?\"" If you're looking for a really good scare, I'd suggest looking elsewhere",1.0,0.5713056325912476

However, I was slightly disappointed for two reasons, one of them being out this place's control. \n1.) There was still a slight wait so just as our group made it to the front and would be the next batch in, we were kicked out because of a \""threat\"". Police surrounded, which made us go back out to try to get our money back. However, we were told it was a bomb threat from a suspicious package being found in a pitch black portion of the haunted maze. Apparently a little kid got lost inside as well, so they had to go find him.  And they wouldn't let us get our money back, so our options were to wait until it was ok to go back in, or leave and forfeit the $25. So we waited, took about 90 minutes (no bomb, found the kid I guess). By then, unfortunately, the fear and adrenaline has subsided, especially when the \""actors\"" also had to evacuate and you could see it really wasn't that scary. \n2.) After waiting to go in, we got to go inside slightly after midnight, but with all the rush of everyone wanting to go in and the actors being tired, we all got rushed through and finished in about 20 minutes versus the 45min we were told it would take. Also ,there was no Jacob Kell theme, or maybe I misunderstood from reading the legend on the website that we weren't going to an actual haunted house, but a warehouse decked out in scary type stuff. There were clowns, and if the theme was to mock a serial killer, I don't really know where clowns fit in. \n\nHere are some things I enjoyed: the 3D portion where you walk along a tunnel that is spinning and a wobbly bridge. That was really cool. Again, more clowns so that was really weird. I hate clowns. The pitch black maze was pretty awesome. You run into the walls quite a bit, which adds to the fun because you have to feel your way around. Not to mention there might be some surprises around certain corners. \n\nIf this place was actually at Jacob Kell's house where he murdered all those people, at disturbing and scary that would be to be on the premises, I would say it's worth the $25. Otherwise, you should go on a thursday next time when it's back when you get a large student discount, or can go in a group of 4 to save more on admission. Heard a lot of people calling in to file complaints. Maybe we'll get our money back. The whole old saloon wild west theme that you walk into before getting to the nest also killed the mood for me. I guess to me, that made me realize it's not really a haunted house, but a staged one.  Oh yeah, the $5 parking fee sucked too.

This easily was one of the worst haunted houses I have ever been to. ( I go to several every year.)  Not only was it 40 dollars to get in a \""VIP\"" line, it was just overall a bad haunt. You pay to be \""VIP\"" and you end up going through each haunt with about 10-15 other random people. The first haunt was called \""Bleak\"" or something like that, all this was is a dark very dark maze. You cannot see your hand in front of your face. There is only 2 actors in the whole maze that jump at you. The rest of the time is just walking in the dark. I can't believe that's all that was. Just walking in the dark. The next haunt was the 3-D haunt. Again, you go through with a group of about 10 or more, so nothing is scary at all. It is pretty cool some parts being 3-d but the fact that you are not with your own group, just ruins it all. the last part had some really cool sets, however again you're supposed to be \""VIP\"" and you end up going through with about 20 people here, so there is nothing to scare you in a group of that size. Aside from some cool sets, that's all this had. There was some cool interactive stuff with your name on gravestones, signing in through Facebook, but that's it.

A lot of time went into building the different sets, at least the first half of it. The first half was pretty interesting, most notably the room where it feels as though you're making your way through a dark and foggy meadow. I felt the whole 35 minute walk relied too heavily on zombie after zombie jumping out and screaming at you, yet there was very seldom that element of surprise. In fact, I was with two easy-to-scare women, who I thought for sure would have to be escorted out, who didn't scream once. \n\nPrice-wise, not a lot of bang for your buck.

Great for kids because there wasn't anything scary about it. But...\n\nCons: there are steps, so half of it is not accessible, if that matters to you. And here's the real problem: it just wasn't scary. You walked through a bunch of different rooms, and some were really wide open (especially in the basement). And there was NOTHING going on. I thought maybe the actors were on break. Upstairs there was mostly animatronics (this is probably misspelled, but we mean to say, monsters being moved mechanically), not people or things that pop out at you. At one point we walked through a hallway with fake arms poking out at us, and we kept expecting one to be real. We were disappointed when nothing was. We walked through an Egyptian chamber with... nothing. And we walked through an ice room with... nothing. And we walked through a room with two immobile zombies DJing with... nothing. \n\nSo if you think this will be like the Nest or the 13th Floor, you will be disappointed.

Nine out of ten haunted houses leave you laughing at the level of cheesiness. However, Monsterland is not nine out of ten haunted houses. Monsterland actually makes me squeal with haunted delight. \n\nThe Monsterland creators really put some serious time, thought and love into their haunted house or as they call it, the horror museum. Each room has a different theme from the history of haunts. It starts with early century haunting with themes such as Phantom of the Opera and Dracula and moves on through the haunt with themes like the mad scientist and plenty of ghosts, goblins and creeps. I like this haunt because it was created with such care that it doesn't look cheesy as you walk through. The rooms are constructed well, it's dark and dreary, the mechanics are par with a scene from a movie and yes, they even have props from famous horror movies! But for me, the actors really make Monsterland stand out from all the rest. They hired real actors to fright the crowd and trust me, it's impossible to know when a real life actor is going to jump out and scare you. They hide throughout the haunt and make it appear to be a prop but *BOO* it's actual and actor! \n\nThis is definitely a haunt worth checking out and I think old and young alike would like it. It's a great date night spots and worth taking kids too as long as they are old enough to realize it's all pretend. \n\nI can't wait to go back and visit the next phase when it turns into a horror museum that's open all year round!",1.0,0.9948411583900452

The rest will make you jump and scream a bit but the tour ended abruptly. =(\n\nStore/Photos: The store had nice shirts, tank tops, mugs, cups, and everything you would typically find after an attraction but with a touch of blood. Our photos that was taken right at the beginning was rushed. I didn't even get a chance to turn around to look at the camera before the air came blasting in my mouth; literarily. So our photos didn't capture my face/reaction, it did capture the props covering my head and torso. If the photo showed my face, it would have been an instant buy.\n\nOverall: Entertaining, scary, theatrical, gory, and dark. I wouldn't change anything except the way photos were taken only because I'm one of those people who love to buy those souvenirs pics. The rooms and actors are nothing that I've seen/experienced before and that is what makes this Goretorium awesome.",0.0,0.994765281677246

We bought our tickets at the door which were $30 each and paid $5 for parking. Once we got past security we went into the tent and saw the line which was 300+ people long. We waited in line for one and a half hours and only saw 3 characters. Once we past the first line we proceeded on to the second line which was to enter into the haunted house . Finally we get to go in (after another 30 min wait) and noticed that everyone was going in single file all together . We walked thru the houses in about 10 min and not once got frightened because everyone was walking in a single line and you knew what was coming next. Very poorly organized and not to mention they didn't have any fans so it was extremely hot. My advice would be to go to another haunted house save your money.A scary movie would be scarier than this haunted house.,0.0,0.9992997646331788

First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.

It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up. \n\nSo save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.\n\nOh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A.

When I heard about House of screams and wicked dreams, I was surprised by the long name. House of screams is definitely just enough for a name. I then heard the news of the production team of Jack and Jill's joining the House of screams team. I was genuinely excited because Jack and Jill's was my favorite house last year! Last weekend I finally got the chance to go to house of screams, but I was highly disappointed. The production was actually pretty good, but It wasn't scary. The animatronics were not working, they would go off late after you passed them up. Some of the actors literally said the word, \""Grrrrrr.\"" The rooms were too spaced out, and they had many opportunities to scare us but didn't take them. There were a few actors that were very good. One that I point to in particular was a girl with long black hair. I was genuinely creeped out. This has the makings of being a great haunted house. But right now, it still needs tons of work and love. \nThings they need to fix:\nAnimatronics\nStatues that do nothing\nWork on timing with actors\nMore detail\nSmaller spaces\nGet rid of clowns, or do something different with them.\n\nThings that are great:\nA few of the actors\nThe story, although it needs a little work\nGood concepts\nSome production\nThis could be a great haunted house!",0.0,0.9161118268966676

This house is pretty amazing for their first year being here. I went to Fear Farm and House of Screams in one night, first Fear Farm and I've gone a few times and it still failed to amuse me, money kind of wasted. I spent about 30-40 minutes at Fear Farm and about 15 minutes of total wait time. The houses were a bit lengthy but it was the usual scare and pretty obvious tricks. So going home on the I-17 I decided to stop at this place and check it out since I never heard of it. To be honest I thought it was going to be pretty lame and a waste of time but you can't knock it 'till you try it right? So once we got in line and bought my tickets the total came to about $42 bucks as to Fear Farm they were $60+. I'm not easy to scare and at Fear Farm I probably startled once or twice. At this place I was startled or a kind of scared from beginning to end, it was amazingly well set-up and they wait for the groups that you go with to get pretty far that you don't catch up to them and you see everything before it happens. They have very good scare tactics and their props and actors are excellent! Needless to say I spent less money here and was definitely worth it, if I never spent the money on Fear Farm I'd go again. But I'll wait until next year. I definitely recommend this place over the others. Well done House of Screams!
