Some people say the hotel is haunted and the pub is not immune from those rumors, just ask some of the women who have used the restroom upstairs.

But I'm quite sold on the atmosphere of this place, inside and out.  Though the food and beverage prices are a bit steep, its nice to have a chill hangout with a good patio.  I went on a Friday night and expected mild-to-moderate revelry, but instead I observed a reserved post-college crowd, soccer on the telly, and a reggae singer.  Sounds like a pleasant evening.\n\nI agree with other Yelpers that the new pub doesn't have the charm of the old house.  The interior is pretty cramped and lacks seperate rooms that gave the old restaurant a parlor-like effect.  Instead, the bar and the compact dining area is seperate by a curtained half wall, breaking up this already cramped space.  So, I headed towards the patio and it was golden-the light rail speeds by you and see the neigbors in the condos acoss the street yelling at one another from the balconies.  Perfect place to see urban life.  The staff is very friendly and though understaffed, a server came out to ask my friend and I if we needed anything.  I find that patio-dwellers get ignored at most joints so this was a nice touch.  \n\nWhile the new Big Ben doesn't make a splash on my list of Charlotte hang-outs, I will atleast give it an honorable mention. It does however make for a nice diversion from my tried and true weekend hangouts or a good spot for  launching an evening in Southend.  I look forward to grabbing dinner at Big Ben the next time I see a show at Tremont or Amos'.",1.0,0.8016613721847534

The piped-in music selection that night was a bit off-putting, in fact, one of the other patrons commented on it as well. It appeared to be a satellite radio station that specialized in 80s hits like Wham! and Depeche Mode. I guess George Michael and David Gahan ARE British. Indeed!

It reminded me immediately of the local village Smiddy pub that my family took me to every Sunday for lunch or dinner (the type that did pate,  steak sandwiches, death-by-chocolate cake. That was my order for a good 12 years). Anyway, I digress. What I mean is, it's homely, it's inviting and not only is it homely, it feels like home. A magic wee trick, where it will both appeal to tourists looking for something very Scottish-y but isn't OTT or a faux-Scottish feel, and instead recreates the cosy Scottish pubs of old.\n\nThere is a very large dining area, for a bar. The bar area itself is quite small and I can imagine would get crowded if many people tried to stay here all at once.

But that's just fine. \n\nThe food menu itself is extensive, and I was immediately intrigued by a Crabbie's Ginger Ale glaze on the chicken. Served with a good helping of skins-still-on chips, it was hearty and filling and good, honest, pub fare.

It is within easy walking distance of the city centre and it is a great place to go in for a drink on your way to a night out. \n\nThe pub prides themselves on their wide range of ales and so they should as they have one of the finest selections in Edinburgh. But the Cask and Barrel it is not just a pub for the guys as they have a good selection of wines behind the bar and they serve a lovely house wine for the ladies. They also sell the standard pub food which is tasty and reasonably priced along with the drinks. \n\nThe Cask and Barrel are showing every World Cup match on their big screens which creates an exciting atmosphere.

The pub is the same: beautiful interior, great fellow drinkers, a classic 'old mans' pub that doesn't try to be anything other than what it is.  \n\nThe reason why this gets three stars is because we decided to head upstairs and eat the other week and that's where things got disappointing, but I don't want to hurt the pub itself because having a drink here is so classic.  Old Bell used to serve pub food, and I remember it being really tasty.  But they've changed to an Italian menu, which is fine.

The restaurant was completely empty when we arrived on a Friday night, which made me a little sad because I really do love the Old Bell and wish I went more often.  The food was fine.  We started with a small portion of the meat platter and it was HUGE!  So glad we ordered the small portion.  For the mains we went with a small portion of the lobster ravioli and the small portion of the mushroom risotto.  The mains were tasty, looked beautiful, again glad we ordered the small.  It was good but nothing really jumped out at me in terms of taste, which again is fine for pub food but this was, fancy pub food.  It was kind of odd to be honest.\n\nThe service was terrible.  The woman who served us was rude, defiant, bored, etc.  She was not interested.  It was when my partner and I couldn't seem to go out to eat anywhere and get good service, which happens from time to time I guess.  \n\nWould I recommend it?  The pub- oh yes.

Where to start? Well, perhaps I should first sum up the vital points for the pub:\n\nPRICE: Discount means that it is cheap for students; prices are reasonable for anyone else.\n\nSIZE: Medium sized, with plenty of seating and tables that can be squished together for larger groups.\n\nFEEL: The pub has a friendly, warm feel to it and is decorated in a modern but homely style.\n\nDRINKS: Not a bad range of drinks, but the beer menu is limited and there are only a few whiskies. There is a perfectly reasonably range of spirits and mixers for a pub, and there are a number of options for the teetotallers amongst us too.\n\nTOILETS: A quick hop up some stairs will present you with some bright toilets which are usually kept clean, and are aired well enough not to smell.\n\nDrouthy's is a good and easy-to-find pub which satisfies the requirements of all sorts of nights out. The atmosphere is accommodating be it for a quite drink, a rowdy pints-in session or indeed for pre-drinks before heading off to crack out the dad dancing. The staff are friendly and there are a fair range of nibbles to choose from, though admittedly the food is nothing special. The pub has quite a sports orientation and there are several large screens, which (love them or hate them) provide a range of sporting channels, and though these can annoy, they do provide the ideal scapegoat if conversation dries up. \n\nThe pub also makes good provision for regular groups. As a member of the Edinburgh University Music Society who meet in the pub on a Tuesday night after rehearsals nearby, I can testify that we are well catered for. Drinks are all sold at student prices without us asking, we are presented with a buffet free of charge and a side of the pub is reserved for us. \n\nAll in all, though certainly not winning any prizes, Drouthy Neebors is the ideal spot for all manner of needs and I feel it is a great little pub to have nearby.",1.0,0.9947109222412108

I didnt get to try any of the food yet so I can comment on that, but the service is good. I have never had a rude or grumpy employee yet so thats good. The crowd that comes in is a good mix. Middle aged and younger all come here. I think its nice to have a good mix of the generations sometimes, its refreshing. Next time I go I will try the food and update this review but as it stands this is a decent pub and I will be coming back",1.0,0.9990251064300536

They don't take reservations so if you're going to be a group show up early.  This place gets packed very quickly especially on weekends.

If you want a proper pub, you would probably be best to stay away from Rose St all together, but if you must come to this part of town, there are practically dozens of other places you could choose from and have a more enjoyable time than in the Rose & Crown.",0.0,0.9895155429840088

Edinburgh has done well to preserve the old school pubs in the city centre so that they can be enjoyed by new generations. The Rose St Brewery is very quaint, the upstairs lounge is my favourite part of the pub. Carpeted floors and old pictures of the city line the walls. A plaque boasts it as being the Pub of The Year in 1985.\n\nI popped in for lunch here and ordered a goats cheese salad - very unlike me as I'm a huge carnivore, however it sounded light and refreshing on the menu, and light and refreshing it was. It came with two huge chunks of goats cheese on a bed of mix salad leaves and seasonal veg with a light dressing. With a nice Guinness this it hit the spot perfectly. Staff could have been a bit more attentive, though I doubt they get much training. Nevertheless it is a boozer, so expect nothing more!
