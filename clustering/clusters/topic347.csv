The food is always well prepared, and they offer a solid variety of menu items. The tappas are very good - I really crave the gnocchi dishes as soon as I enter the building. Try the club sandwich - seems like a vanilla type item to order - but the Sparklings does it better than anyone.",1.0,0.9997527003288268

The wait staff was not on it that night either, it seemed like no one was sure what section they were serving.... took for ever to get one over and get our drinks.\n\nI had a Moscow bourbon in a copper cup mmmmmm! And started with the crispy gnocchi which I will say again was my favorite! My meal was the rice au gratin with chicken very good but very rich! \n\nTo finish they gave us a free flourless chocolate cake for my and my friends birthday! very good but, dense and rich , order a side of ice cream to go with defiantly needed . \n\nAll and all I want to give this place another chance to get five stars I know they have it in them I just need that stellar service.",0.0,0.9277118444442748

One of my favorite dishes when prepared correctly, but they just missed - badly!\n\nOn the plus side the Gnocchi were little pillows of wonderfulness! Reminded me on our neighborhood  \""little Italian lady\"" who made it for me as a child over 60 years ago and was, until now, the very best I have ever had. This version was very close and was served with a wonderful four cheese white sauce (calorie free for certain!). The Caesar Salad was a decent rendition but nothing I have eaten here approached the Gnocchi, unfortunately.\n\nWorth the trip for the Gnocchi alone!",0.0,0.9807865023612976
