Most everything including entrees & appetizers has their sign8ture hatch chili's in/on it which is just 2 much 4 me.\n\n   Last time we went here 4 her B~day celebr8ion she didn't touch anything on her pl8 but took it home 4 l8r.

The chips w/ guac & bean dip were actually the best of what I had.

We ordered a special sopapilla churro dessert they were promoting 4 my sister because we wanted 2 c her @ least eat (instead of drink) something. It showed a large mint green choc chip scoop of ice~cream pictured in the center w/ choc sauce drizzled over but she got a small scoop of vanilla in center w/ no chocol8 topping.

Our group had arrived before we got there and had ordered drinks, just water, but when we came our waiter never asked us if we wanted something to drink. When our waiter finally came over  I quickly made my order which was a warm turkey sandwich with Brie cheese, green apple, with apricot preserves on a croissant. Sounded right up my alley cause I've been on a huge Brie kick! The waiter asked if fries were OK and I said yes, assuming that's what came with it. Found out later I could have had a salad instead. I was very disappointed in my sandwich, but I was happy the apricot preserves came on the side cause they were gross. The croissant was crumbling and dry. I doubt there was any Brie on the sandwich at all. Overall I ended up ditching the croissant and just eating the meat and apples. The fries were also meh. \n\nEveryone else in my group enjoyed their food. My Husband and brother-in-law got the Le Burger de Madame. It wasn't cooked medium like my husband requested, but well done.

It was kinda of small compared to other places we've been but was still tasty.  The pancake was another story.  It was almost like they forgot to put sugar in the mix because it was bland.

(after one failed attempt one fateful Thanksgiving evening out on the town but I digress) and I was pleasantly pleased. \n\nI loOoOoved the interior decor and the fabulous looking outdoor patio kept calling my name but the 110 degree heat outside said \""Shut your mouth!\"" so I didnt attempt it. At around 1pm on a Friday, the place was humming but not overly (or annoyingly) busy and there was a wide array of patrons so that was cool. \n\nOrdered the All-American cheeseburger after debating over getting the FEZ burger. (I should've got the FEZ Burger). The American burger was good, your standard burger fare, it came with some tasty garlic mayo that gave it some interest and the spicy harissa fries were fun. The ciabatta bread was great, I was nervous it would be hard but it was fantastic on the burger and didn't cause any gum-cutting. So all-in-all, my meal was good. Now the FEZ burger, which I bummed a bite off of from my sis, was fan-f'n-tastic. I get a little wierded out by random things on food so the bleu cheese, pear, onion ring combo deterred me in writing but spoke to me in my mouth. Amazing!! My hubby got it with the cilantro on it along with the sweet potatoe fries and devoured it all in minutes. He loved it! Plainly stated, the FEZ Burger is genious so YAY FEZ!!!! You were good and I'm sad that I didnt get to eat the other half of my sister's burger (hours in a car, really hot. . . .long story) but one day when I go back to PHX, I will visit you and take on my own FEZ burger with gusto!!!\n\nOoooOoOOOoo and how can I forget the chocolate mousse!!!! VERY, VERY, VERY rich. Thank goodness we shared it because 2 people STILL couldn't finish the entire beautiful display of chocolate mousse and handmade whipped topping.

They offer wine by the standard glass and bottle, but they also offer by a glass-and-a-half. This was a perfect pour.\n\nWe skipped appetizers and I ordered the pasta bolognese while my boyfriend opted for the chicken parmigiana. After we ordered, we were brought bread and a roasted tomato butter. This was very tasty. My bolognese arrived with giant shells as the pasta, with large shavings of parmesan on top. It was delicous, with the exception of having fennel in it (which is just a personal preference!). I ate almost all of it. Sadly, we found the chicken parm to be a little bland. \n\nTo end the evening we ordered the \""nutella mousse cake\"" which sounded amazing but was also a bit disappointing. We ate about half of it and when our waiter asked how it was and our response was mediocre, he insisted on comping the dish even though we had eaten half of it. This got big points in my book. He said \""if you don't absolutely love it, I can't charge you for it\"". Our bill for two after a good tip for the waiter was about $70.\n\nOverall, I recommend NoRTH.  the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the parm was a little bland and it was a bit pricey.

For a \""mom and pop\"" brunch diner joint it was a very big and delicious burger cooked to order. Your buck also goes a very long way at this place where as the portion sizes are huge. I also think they make their own ranch sauce which was also very very impressive. \n\nMy friend and sister ordered their famous Mamas country steak and eggs. And it definitely did not disappoint.  The country gravy sauce on top really brings the meal together and yes the has browns are also seasoned and taste to perfection\n\nWe also ordered a small cup of chili which was more a bowl size order to me. Just the right consistency on the chili, not watery and not salty. I like my chili chunky and it was just right and enough that all three of us were able to try it. \n\nThere was so much we had to bring home. The place is always packed and the customers keep coming back I'm sure not just for the food but also for the amazing customer service received upon entering the establishment. \n\nHalf of the dinning experience I always say is service and Mr. Mamas really has it all to a T! Again I give it to the owner who makes his way to each table to ask how they are doing and it makes the whole dining experience more personable. I love coming here and I cannot wait for their larger establishment to open and for them to move and get the bigger space they well deserve!!",1.0,0.9995813965797424

We went at about 8pm on a Friday night, and it was a 20 minute wait.  \n\nWe started off with Edamame (which you can never go wrong with) and this shrimp appetizer that was really good. The shrimp is lightly battered and fried, and then they put this sweet and sour sauce over it.  \n\nI really wanted to try one of the asian noodle dishes, but the waitress they were about a 6 on a scale of 1-10 spicyness, so I wasn't even going to try.

The salad was really good, but I definitely will ask for light dressing next time (I don't like to much dressing).  The chicken in the salad was delicious!  And the turkey chili was yummy and not too spicy for my taste.\n\nWe ended our meal with the brownie with ice cream.  The brownie was so moist and soft.

I found this little gem on my last trip. I ended up going there twice during my 4 day stay since the food was so good. \n\nFirst time was on a Sunday afternoon. I had the Gorgonzola burger with sweet potato fries. Both were excellent. The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection. The cheese on top gave it a really great flavor. I am a sweet potato fries fanatic and these were not the best ever, but pretty good just the same. I also had an ice cold beer with my meal; glad to see they had some good bottled micro-brews. The combo really hit the spot and I left extremely satisfied even though I was ravenous when we arrived. My friend got the spinach salad and when I tasted it it was also very good. She also took advantage of the $3 mimosas they offer on Sundays and said they were perfectly made. \n\nWhen we went back with my sister a couple days later I decided to try a salad since that is what they are known for. I got the arugula and pear one and it was delicious! A lot of texture and crunch. It had a bite to it from the arugula but the pear balanced this with a little sweetness and the goat cheese and fennel added an extra flavor dimension. My friend got the same spinach salad (she liked it that much!) and a Bellini which she said was not nearly as good as the mimosas. My sister had a wrap and regular fries. She said they were good but nothing special. I think the best items at this place are definitely the salads. \n\nI agree with some reviewers' comments that the prices seem a little steep for what you get. But the quality of the food and the excellent service make it well worth what you pay. Sitting out on the patio on a nice day, this is a great place for a ladies' lunch or even a brunch/lunch date. We did notice that on weekdays this seems to be a haven for mommies/nannies with little ones in tow.

However their sommelier helped us decide on a few glasses of Greek wines and brought over a couple to try before ordering. Our waiter helped tweak the menu a bit so we could order 4 different appetizers as our dinner. He wanted to course them, but in Greece you order a bunch and have them out all at once so you can take a bite here and there. He was able to do that for us. \n\nWe got the milos special which is fried zucchini and eggplant served with tzatziki, the grilled octopus, horiatiki salad, and htipiti. Octopus is difficult to get right, and unfortunately, many restaurants get it wrong. It's difficult to cook yourself too so I don't make a habit of it. Milos did an amazing job. Tender and flavorful, not dry and overcooked. Awesome. The htipiti was a welcome memory as it's only served regionally in Greece and seems we could get it in the northern region but ask for it in Athens and they look at you funny. \n\nService was spot on, of course.

My sister had some dietary restrictions due to allergies and being a polio survivor and other conditions and one of the things she can no longer have is pepper which many restaurants use to make lower salt items. Charles consulted with the chef and they had conversations and not just a scribble on order.

In looking at other tables I also saw other people's food items I also wanted, but as watching the staff made the night for me and it did my heart good to just see them in action with no holes in the line-up. I opted for a Belgian pale because I don't normally think wine and Vegas generally belong in the same sentence but if I do return I think I'll look at the list. When I go back I will rectify my only regret of not ordering the Cassolette and compare it with the Paris five star versions.

Our waitress and the manager were both very sweet and we were taken great care of. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered the funky monkey with espresso dust and loved it. My brother-in-law and twin both ordered the souther' with avocado and they both finished theirs so my guess is they really liked it! My sister had the fosters and it was so good and she really loved it. As for me, I tweaked the breakfast magic, adding mushrooms inside and avocado on top! Amazing. And paired with the bourbon syrup it was so crazy good! \n\nWe also ordered some of the sweet potato waffle fries and they were pretty good, too! The coffee was fresh and refilled quickly. I look forward to my next visit!",1.0,0.9997358918190002

Inside the decor has a very clean, neat & modern look.\nSince there was five of us, we ordered a very wide variety of dishes. A couple of dishes that stood out is the Sake Orenji, their take on salmon sashimi. The flavor of orange stood out and it complemented the fish quite well. Nana Iro, hamachi sashimi. It came with a mix of grapefruit, avocado, tomato & pickled fennel which also formed a well combination. The tea brined ribs are finger licking good, although they do take quite awhile to prepare so remember to order them early in the meal. The mango panna cotta & mango ice cream paired very well with the nutty & saltiness of pistachios.\nThe service was good. The employees were very attentive & considerate. Some might consider Yonaka slightly on the pricey side but there is a happy hour to take advantage of. In my opinion, it's definitely worth a try. I give Yonaka 4.5 stars.",1.0,0.999592125415802

So my sister mentioned she saw this on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It wasn't the same spot, as they had moved from the original location to open up a larger restaurant. The back lot parking is tiny and awkward, since you'd have to back out of it to get out. But, there is plenty of street parking. \n\nWe showed up on a Saturday morning, after a walk through the nearby farmers market. The wait wasn't all that long. It was only 15 minutes for us, as we were here at about 9:30am. But, it got pretty crowded when we left.\n\nAs for all the great reviews, hrmmm... Overall, I think the food is just average. My parents got the griddlecakes, bacon and eggs. My sister got the porkchops with homefries. I ended up getting eggs, sausage, hash and toast. The parents griddlecakes were huge. They could have easily split them to share. I snagged a piece of bacon and found it quite tasty. The hasbrown was kinda overcooked, almost to the point where it was sorta burnt. Not quite, but almost. Some nice soft, white bits in my hashbrowns would have been nice. The toast was pretty chewy and took some teeth gnawing action, in order to swallow. My sister's porkchops and homefries were just okay. Though the chops look like they were seasoned with something, it wasn't all that flavorful and a bit dry.\n\nThe servers were friendly and prompt. They were quick to refill drinks. The only notable thing that stuck out was that they were sitting 3 people at what I would consider a 2 person table. A bit of a tight fit there with all the knee bumping action going on.\n\nThe place is good. It's just not great. Definitely nothing spectacular.",0.0,0.9598405361175536

This time happened to be Tapas and Sangria night. The Chef first explained to us the history of Tapas which was very interesting. Then he explained the menu in detail. We had two different kinds of sangria and our glasses were constantly refilled. There were 10 different tapas and it was all soooo good! I enjoyed this experience very much. I tried new food that I didn't think I would like but I did ! I can't wait to try some of the other themed classes.

It was my first time dining here since the renovation. This used to be my go-to spot for a special occasion dinner back when it was Cork. I heard that they were trying to make Earnest a more casual concept but everything seemed pretty much the same to me except a few minor cosmetic changes in the d\u00e9cor. The prices on the menu were just as high. We spent $100 for the two of us including tax and tip as well as a $30 bottle of wine that tasted a bit off.\n\nAnyway, it ended up being worth it because we both loved our food. We started with the fried Brussels sprouts which were amazing. We both loved them so much and I really wish the dish came with more. My sister ordered the vegetable lasagna and she raved over it even though it had ricotta cheese which she doesn't usually like too much. I got the lamb meatballs and daily risotto. These are on the menu as a starter and a side dish, respectively, but together they made for a very delicious meal. The lamb meatballs are a must-order, they are truly fantastic.

So... we're trying to overthrow the tarts? \n\nAnyways, I'm glad that we got here early, because even on a Wednesday, the place filled up pretty quickly.

Her lamb shank came out on a bed of cous cous with assorted vegetables on the side. It was tasty, but a little on the salty side. My salmon came with spinach and basmati rice, topped with a green olive salsa and pesto on the side. I don't usually like green olives, but it went well with the fish, though the salmon was cooked a bit more than I would prefer. The rest of the dish was well seasoned, but the salsa was a bit salty. Both dishes came in pretty big portions, and went great with their housemade mint iced tea. \n\nEven though we were pretty full already, we figured that we couldn't leave without having some dessert! We had the chocolate peanut butter tart, which was great, but way too rich after our entrees. It was more chocolatey than peanut-butter-y, and not too sweet.
