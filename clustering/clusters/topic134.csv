I s'pose seeing animals in cages bothers me. Yes, that must be it. Also, smelling their fecal matter and wondering if the animals are embarrassed that they can't take a dump 1,500 ft away from their watering hole or sleeping spot. I would be embarrassed. Humans don't put toilets in the kitchen, after all. \n\nSure, I love being able to see live and in -person jaguars, snakes, apes, elephants, etc. But I always leave feeling sad, like the animals can't possibly be happy and content being locked up. They must know they're restricted. Sure, you build a cheetah a cage and think he's happy running the same path 1,349 times a day. But, let's face it, he's not. Don't tell me you haven't noticed. \n\nAnd while I love that I've seen live pandas (in DC) or dolphins (in OKC), I just hate seeing animals in captivity. I wouldn't want to be caged. Who knows, one of these days, it could be the flying squirrel and her family, along with donkeys and dung beetles, who pay a minimal fee to come see human beings in cages and behind glass. \""Oh, look,\"" the baby flying squirrel will say, \""that one there is flinging his poo!

Papago Peak was a gorgeous backdrop for the wildlife. One other really stand-out exhibit was the monkey habitat. There is a winding path through a bunch of trees, and the monkeys jump through the trees and even cross the path every so often. Less enchanting were the tiger and lion exhibits; the habitats were run-down, and the animals seemed lonely and restless.

Not cool.. wait till you close and move those babies.\n\nI dunno, maybe its just the concept of tropical animals residing in the desert that is strange to me, but its just not that awesome here. I felt bad for them, and I don't think its just because I am a hippie. Also, I'm not sure if its always as crowded as it was or if every pre-school in Arizona was taking a field trip here that day but it was so loud, there were strollers everywhere, I almost fell on about 12 kids, got tripped by about 54 of them, but nonetheless, it was funny and seeing how excited they got at the sight of the animals made it a little bit more magical, even though this zoo kinda blows.",0.0,0.9130250811576844

I don't know of any other Zoo's that have it, but if you have a zoo with zoo lights, consider yourself lucky, and go to one immediately . If you don't have one, come to the Phoenix Zoo around Christmas time, and see the zoo lights. It's so pretty, and puts you in such a great Christmas mood. It definitely brings out the Christmas now a days, since most people don't seem to decorate or celebrate it as much, anymore =(",1.0,0.99092298746109

There are splash pads, paddle boats, a carousel, petting zoo, a hands-on stingray exhibit....the list goes on.  The animal enclosures, or lack-thereof, are a refreshing change to those seen in many older zoos.  The exhibits are expansive and the animals seem happy and well cared for.

I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, which has good zoos full of cold weather animals. The Phoenix Zoo is full of hot weather animals (makes sense), but it really nicely laid out and has a ton to do. We had free passes that day, so we skipped the line and didn't have to pay, which probably colors my view a bit, but we walked around for 4 hours and saw almost every exhibit and habitat that we could, and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThe Lions and the Rhino were amazing...The Jaguar was beautiful, and just paced around his area, like he was stalking prey. There is a cool baboon exhibit, and so many other animals that you can see, from Bighorn Rams to the Komodo Dragon. The coolest area is this wide open space with the giraffes, and it also has longhorns and ostriches. It's a huge space, and you can really see the animals run around be more natural. The elephant and turtles are pretty cool too. \n\nIn other news, I had a kindred spirit moment at the otter habitat. True story:\n\nI've always felt like my spirit animal is an otter (yeah, I said it), and when I went to see the otters, there was one outside laying on a log. After I'd been standing there a minute, he perked up, looked back at me and walked away into his little house thing. A few seconds later, TWO otters came out of the rocks and they came outside and swam around, ultimately ending up at a patch of grass right in front of the railing I was looking over, and both were staring at me. The guy next to me said \""wow, I've never seen them do this. I've been coming here regularly for more than a year and they always just hang out on the log\"". I wasn't the only one that noticed the fact that the otters were clearly excited that I was there...Definitely one of my top animal/human moments so far in my life.\n\nAfter the otter experience it was bound to be a 5 star day, but I also got to ride a camel...Yes, I rode a camel.\n\nIn short, the Phoenix Zoo is great. I've lived her almost two years and had never been. If you've yet to go, do it soon, and say hi to the otters for me.",1.0,0.9985748529434204

The worst thing about this zoo is the price. In this depression (yes, with a small d), why does $18 per adult make sense? I know you can get free tickets at the library, but have any of you ever actually tried to get tickets at the library? They're always out. This zoo nickel and dimes your pocket. If you want to pet the sting rays (who wants to pet a sting ray?), the giraffes, if you require water or a wheelchair, they're ready with their sticky fingers. I feel sorry for the people who paid to feed the giraffes because I watched as they were hounded with instructions on what to do, where and how to do it and what not to do. It really stifles the enjoyment of feeding the giraffes. Wonder how the giraffes feel. I watched as a lady complained in front of a large crowd of people about the giraffe feeding price and the lady taking cash answered matter-of-factly that it's a non-profit zoo. This is the phrase they've been taught to say. The woman walked away, likely feeling scorned. A small salad costs $8. A bottle of water is $3. Boat rides are $12 ea. Camel rides are $12. For a Polaroid of the camel ride, it's $5. \n\nIf you purchase a $75 membership, you can come back throughout the year and receive an overrated discount on feeding the giraffes and the tram ride and the carousel for a grand total of $1-2 a ride! To clarify, I DON'T have kids. Yes, I'm complaining about the cost of TWO adults. \n\nThe cashier at the entrance is a nasty woman named Eyvonne. She must have needed a Depends change and that would explain her CRAPPY attitude. The rest of the zoo is staffed by high brow teenagers. It's too bad the animal environment doesn't soften their attitude. \n\nThis is primarily a hot weather zoo. There are no penguins or polar bears here. A lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed. I've been here a few times and have yet to see the coyotes. On the \""Desert Trail\"", they are true to the spirit of the desert, because there's no water fountains on it. \n\nThat said, I enjoy the World Wildlife Zoo on Olive Ave. much better and would gladly drive from Mesa to Waddell to go there.

The last time I went to this zoo I was NOT happy. But I figured, hey let's try again...\n\nFirst off, do not go to this place without a coupon. I had a free kid coupon from the savvy shopper which put admission for my daughter and me @ $20. Not bad. \nGet there early. Parking is a nightmare around lunchtime. Avoid photo vultures at entrance upon arrival. \n\nWe walked in and decided to hop on the safari train for an extra $5 each. For the size of this zoo, that was the best idea EVER. We went clear around the African trail and surprisingly saw most animals and decent views as well. I have walked that trail before and seen NOTHING so I was happy with that. \n\nAfter that we hopped off the train and walked to the exhibits you miss from the train. Orangutans must have all been sleeping. Boo. That's usually the best part. Bears were out, which is usually not the case. Little monkey exhibit is VERY cool, only problem is the little kids who run around and scare the monkeys back into the trees. Seriously I could not believe some of these kids in this place were allowed to act the way they did. \n\nI didn't buy any concession items. Brought my own snacks and water. They looked pricey though. \n\nI think the cooler temps had a lot to do with the animals being out. It was around 65 or 70. \n\nI'll go back next fall.

I would expect this at a theme park, but not at a non-profit museum or zoo.

It makes for an unpleasant experience with kids, who of course want to ride the carousel every time, and want to look at and buy all the toys at the end.

Lots of little monkeys.\n\nMy favorite part is when you get to go inside the bird enclosure and feed the parrots apples. Buckets of clean apple chunks are provided for you at no cost and all you have to do is hold a piece on your hand and the birds will come over and eat them off your hand. They are gentle and very friendly.\n\nI also like that you can get a boat tour and take the sky lift for less than $5 each. Very affordable. The ticket price may be a bit more expensive but I had a buy one get one free coupon which was helpful. So if you're ever headed out to BFE or wouldn't mind making the drive, its definitely worth it.",1.0,0.992234468460083

I've lived in Phoenix since '95 and I just went for the first time. What is that nonsense! It's like a hidden gem that no one talks about. \n\nAdmittedly, the parking lot and area where you pay to get in are a little ghetto, but it gets so much better so quickly! The variety of critters is amazing and, for the most part, they do appear to have enough room and comfortable quarters (although I worry about them in the summer heat). The exhibits are such that you can get literally within touching distance to most of the animals, and in turn the animals are pretty mellow -- hanging out nice and close, not frightened of their admirers. So cool to see some of these gorgeous creatures so close! \n\nThe aquariums are pretty cool too, although in general things without fur or feathers freak me out. Lots of hands-on exhibits, where you can touch stingrays, starfish, crabs, and the like if you are so inclined (I was so not). \n\nI'm a sucker for the petting zoo, where I thoroughly enjoyed being raped by twelve goats and two deer. Those bastards are aggressive and had no qualms about gnawing on my fingers, jacket, and rings when my little goat kibbles were all gone. Oh, but they're so cute. I wanted to take one of the twee little pygmy goats and stick it in my bag. \n\nFeeding the giraffes was another highlight. It's just so much better to be able to get up so close and personal to the creatures.\n\nThe best part is that it wasn't very crowded, although the inclement weather probably helped with that. I hate battling all the overexcited bratty children at places like this, but really, it was mellow. The admission cost is about what I expected ($27 ish?), and same goes for the cost and quality of the food. The food is cash only, be 'ware!",1.0,0.9809320569038392

The otters were in an incredibly tiny cage. It might have been good for a bird or two, but there were two otters in it.

I would probably give more like 3.5 instead of 4. In my opinion it is much better than the Phoenix Zoo which is really small and has very limited attractions. WWZ is quite expensive at $31 per adult and $15 per child but you can often find coupons online good for $4 off per person up to 4 people with a google search. On the weekends they have informational shows with the animals which is fun. I think that some of the enclosures are a bit small for the animals which makes me sad but I think that the zoo does the best that it can. \n\nThis zoo is chock full of parrots of all kind free roaming the zoo. You will find some kind of parrot around just about every corner. The parrots can be fun to talk to and can be quite entertaining, it makes me wonder if they maybe rescue unwanted or abandoned parrots from around the valley. I wish that they had more information posted about the animals or more zoo employees walking around that you could talk to about the exhibits. It seems that they will be expanding the zoo as they have many signs posted about future exhibits. I hope that they do not raise the price anymore once these exhibits are built because it might become to much of an expense for a family if the price goes up much more.\n\nThe aquarium is just okay. They are expanding this as well but they need to have many more tropical exhibits. I know it is still fairly new and the fish are still growing in to the habitat but the aquarium still seems to be lacking something. Again more zoo employees need to be walking around with information because I would like to learn more about the fish/animals especially if I am paying so much.\n\nOverall this zoo has quite a bit to see and it is a great spot to get out in AZ. Some things could be changed but I'm hoping they will continue to make improvements as they grow. I recommend going in January through May or October through December.

For 2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 children under 12 the admission was $94 and this was after 2 buy one get one free admission coupons. \n\nOnce we were inside the zoo we discovered there was no tram to take you around just a small train that cost an additional $4 per person. For what we paid, that train should have been included. \n\nAnother issue I had was that there was no pavement only dirt which kept blowing up in our faces. \n\nThis was definitely my first and last visit to this zoo.",0.0,0.9962795376777648

Firstly, this is a private owned zoo and I know a few people that work or have worked here and believe me the so tires i hear is not pretty, but that is another story entirely.  This chapter is about my visit to the park.  I tried to leave as much bias judgement aside, since my girlfriend was with me and I didn't want to ruin the trip for her (well she told me not to).  The Zoo itself is well organized, clean, and can experience everything in one day. Here's the bad news; all the mammal exhibits are incredibly boring and small providing almost no enrichment for the animals.  The reptiles exhibits are extremely out-dated, albeit they are a wild selection of herps; their exhibits make me feel depressed for these animals.  This is a zoo that shows really easily that ones an area is built, it is no longer taken care of, instead just building on the next big thing.  There is a shining star in this review however, the aquarium is nice, they need more variety (there predator room as green iguanas in a huge enclosure.. GREEN IGUANAS!! HERBIVORES in a PREDATOR AQUARIUM!)..ugh pardon me... Given the small amount of choices you have to visit here in arizona, they do have penguins (oh yeah).. this aquarium severely trumps az sea life and any other faux aquarium we may have in this state.\n\nin conclusion, i ranted too much.  It's a zoo, go outside, visit it, enjoy nature and see cool animals.  Downside..there are many many many many better zoos out there.",0.0,0.9595445394515992

The prices weren't too bad for admission and they have $4 off coupons in ValPak. We got there at around 1:30 and still had time to do everything by 6pm and that also included us dining in at Dillon's. We had asked if there were anymore eating areas and was told no so we ate there. WRONG! There were a couple eating areas in the park but we actually enjoyed the restaurant so we didn't mind too much. We finished up with lunch and we started our long awaited journey. I've never seen so many exotic birds they kept on getting more beautiful after the next. The monkeys of course were my favorite. They were very hyper today swinging around showing off their acrobatic skills haha the lions were lazy they were asleep when we went by.. kind of bummed but we did get to see the other awesome cats such as the jaguars, white tigers and orange tigers. \n\nThe aquarium was amazing! I really enjoyed looking and touching the different species. The stingrays are the coolest, I love the way they come up to you for attention. They have feeding sessions for $3.00 and there were others where you could just walk up and touch them like the star fish, horseshoe crabs and sea urchants.\n\nIt was overall a fun experience. I'd definitely go again, this time of the year is a great time to go.. definitely recommend bringing quarters to feed the giraffe it was a lot of fun, we were there for like 20 minutes.

I was impressed with some of the species they had: nautilus, sea horses, otters, penguins, to name a few. \nSome of the animals are in really sad conditions, though. The sea lion was having a panic attack in the corner of his tiny pool and the birds in the aquarium seemed miserable. \nWhile, like I mentioned, I appreciate the ability to interact with animals, this park seems more focused on entertaining rather than teaching & learning.

There's lots of parking which is free.  The zoo is large and it's about $32 for entry as an adult but we managed to snag a deal on Groupon which they happily honored and brought down the entry fee to about $23.  \nThe zoo is large so be prepared to walk however one should consider bringing sneakers as it's mostly dirt roads so open-toed slippers isn't a good idea.  One should also spray themselves with bug spray before coming if you're planning on wearing shorts or sleeveless as there are some bugs around some of the animal pens.\nThere are lots of exhibits however I found that around every corner was bird exhibits and this should be an aviary rather than a zoo as there's more bird exhibits than regular exhibits.  Some exhibits allow you to feed the animals however there aren't any antiseptic gel dispensers so one should walk with some Purrell hand sanitizer after you've fed the animals as it could get sloppy.\nBe sure to bring a backpack with water as I didn't find too many concession stands evenly spaced around the place selling drinks.\nBefore leaving be sure to check out the aquarium to the left of the entrance.  I can easily see how it can be missed as there aren't too many glaring signs for it but it's worth it.  For me, I thought it was better than the regular zoo.\nSome of the enclosed exhibits, e.g. newborn smelled malodorous so be prepared to gag if you don't have a strong stomach.

Unfortunately, I couldn't help but notice that it seemed so because the living areas are so small.

Not so nice for the kids but a little comforting to me.\n\nI felt most moved by the gorillas and orangutans.  Their indoor sanctuaries were so small and there didn't seem like many things to entertain themselves with.

Birds, fish, and rodents - sure.  But the large animals seemed to have so little.\n\nThe aquarium is ok.  Compared to the amazing Monterey Bay Aquarium, it's just a cute little building.

The zoo is small and very walkable, however they have theses trams that pass through on the already too narrow walkways. I believe that's a 2 dollar ride. I'd say the aquarium is the best part of the zoo, because its new and we were there at feeding time to watch the keepers feed the sea anemones . The zoo food was terrible. I had a hot sausage sandwich that was bland and sad. And the food court wasnt large enough to support the crowd. The play ground is essentially a few slides and cargo nets .",0.0,0.9856752753257751

Wifey loves animals, so we decided to check it out, and we're really glad we did.\n\nInside has two main parts, the dolphin area, and the big cat area. There's also a small cafe and a gift shop.\n\nHaving visited lots of zoos and Marine World type places, we've seen plenty of dolphins, but this is the closest we've ever gotten. You can get within arms reach of them swimming by. The trainers went through feeding and training exercises, so you can see the usual routines of dolphins doing their thing. The staff were very knowledgeable and friendly, answering all of our questions and happily chatting with visitors. They support cruelty free dolphin habitats, which means you can NOT swim with the dolphins here.\n\nThe big cat area was also a treat. You can get within a couple feet of the chain link fence, and some of the cats come right up to the fence, so you can really see them up close. There were a total of 8 big cats on display when we visited, including a leopard, a jaguar, a lion, and several tigers.\n\nThe most popular exhibit is the two white tiger cubs, now 9-months old. One of them spent 2 hours wrestling his big green tub out of the pool, only to have the trainer keep throwing it back in again. It was incredibly cute to watch him pulling and tugging and playing with that tub. The other cub hung out at the other end of the enclosure, occasionally sprinting across to ambush his brother with a sneak attack and tumble. They were adorable.\n\nThey close at 6:30pm and they stop letting people in an hour before that. We came a little before 5 on a week day and there were very few other visitors, maybe 30 people in the whole park. By the time we left we were nearly the last ones out, and they still hadn't closed yet. The low attendance combined with how close you can get to the animals made for a very intimate experience, which we both loved.\n\nYou could see everything in this mini-Marine World in 30 minutes.

Usually it's some mediocre experience for a high price and we walk away feeling used. Luckily, at S & R, it was not the case. We had a great time, even in 103 degree heat. I brought my daughter, (7) and my son (2) here one morning, it was $29 total at the gate. \n\nWe walked in and was immediately greeted by a Dolphin in a large pool. We walked around and saw an adjoining pool with 2 more dolphins, which I assume were for the Dolphin experience where you can swim with the dolphins. \nWe walked over the bridge to an even larger pool where 4 dolphins greeted us, including Mirage's newest treasure, a baby dolphin. The shade was sparse, but the view was incredible. You are as close to the dolphins as you can be without being in the pool with them. Off to the left is a gift shop, where 2 people greet you with a camera and take various pics before letting you through the next door and into the rest of the garden. We saw a leopard in a very small area =( He was pacing back and forth and it was very sad to see. There was one lion taking a nap on a tree, and then around the corner was the white tiger display. The leopard and the lion are definitely the red-headed step child in this situation because the white tigers digs are niiiiice in comparison. The white tigers were very entertaining and awe inspiring, however one cannot help but wish they were able to be free from their cages and in the wild where they belong. \n\nAs we exited the caged area, we went through the other gift shop where the attendants showed us our pictures and gave their best sales pitch. We continued on our adventure to the front where we started, but went down the ramp to the underwater display of the dolphins. The facility is beautiful down there and very peaceful. I was just giving myself a talking to in my head \""See Karey, Vegas can be fun for kids.....\"" just then my daughter squealed, \""MOM WHAT ARE THEY DOING?\""  \nMe: \""ummm what do you think they are doing?\""\nDaughter: \""Dancing?\""\nMe: \""Yes, Dancing\""\nFor you parents out there you know that and \""wrestling\"" is the standard answer for what we saw. There were 3 male dolphins \""dancing\"" so much that they slammed against our viewing window. I don't want to talk about why I know they were male, but trust me, they were male.

They have three dolphin pools - two for training and one mother/baby pool.  It's basically a trainer talking in a microphone the whole time while you watch those that paid for the trainer program feed and tell the dolphins to do tricks.   There are no schedules, so you are moving from pool to pool in order to see the dolphins.  Also, there is a very small amount of shade around the pools so bring sunscreen and be prepared to stand directly in the Las Vegas sun!  They do have underground viewing for the dolphins as well.  The mother/baby pool was the best part for me as it was fun to see the babies swimming alongside their mother.  Don't come here expecting to see a choreographed show as they don't do this here.  They are trying to keep them as \""natural\"" as possible which I think is the best thing they can do for dolphins in captivity.  \n\nThe big cat exhibit was a big letdown.  They have two white tigers, two black panthers and two lions in what appears to be small enclosures.  They are doing some construction to either make the place bigger or for new animals.  We went at around noon and every single cat was sleeping.  The most exciting thing for the three kids in our group was the Fountain of Longevity in this area.  They had more fun splashing in the water than watching the tigers or dolphins.\n\nThe snack bar is way overpriced as I spent over $11 for three Slurpee drinks.  The gift shop has many overpriced things as well ($36 for a stuffed animal).  I know it's Vegas, but after paying $75 for 3 adults & 1 child to get in, I had spent enough on this exhibit.

Wasn't sure why the dolphins were here but they add a nice touch and sometimes they do a show. The area is pretty large and the staff is both knowledgeable and friendly. The price is a bit much but in the end was worth it. Mirage guests get $4 bucks knocked off.",1.0,0.9993246793746948

I have to say that it was one of the top 10 Coolest Things I've done in my life!  It was AMAZING!!  If you can afford it at all, try to do this.  It cost $200 per person, but it was totally worth it for me.  Included in this price is one on one time with the dolphin where you paint a picture and then let the dolphin help you complete the picture - as well as a photograph of you with the dolphin.  It was an absolute joy!  However, it is not a private experience!  You feel like you are part of the show because everyone is filming it.\n\nThe only thing that could have improved the experience was that the blonde trainer left something to be desired.  She let me feed Cosmo exactly 4 fish even though I was doing it correctly.  She did all the feeding herself and then lectured me about how they work for food.  OK I get it.  But what is the big frickin deal whether the paying guests feed them or the trainer feeds them?!  It would mean so much to the guests while the trainers do it on a daily basis.  The dolphin doesn't care WHO feeds them.  They are smart enough to know that if they paint they will be fed!   I still gave the experience 5 stars because the trainer DID provide me with a lot of education about dolphins and it truly was a magical experience.  However, I was prepared to give a $100 tip which she didn't receive because she was so stingy with the fish.  If they can learn from this criticism, it would make this soooo much better.",1.0,0.984512209892273

Tropical, heavily landscaped with nice friendly people. What most people aren't aware of is that the dolphin habitat has a 60% dolphin death rate. Why?? Mostly because sub tropical animals don't do well in the middle of the desert yet alone, on the Las Vegas strip. This facility owns 10 bottlenose dolphins that if you look closely, show extreme signs of stress. Floating listless at the surface. Making repetitive methodical laps around the pools. Waiting by the gates. Some even chewing the gates. No shade to escape the scorching sun. This facility is in violation of the Animal Welfare Act concerning shade which they do not offer for the four dolphins kept in the rear pool from 11am to 5pm. Some of these dolphins have a skin condition called poxvirus which would normally clear up if wasn't for extreme stress endured by this situation. Please reconsider giving The Mirage any money and supporting this lack of care. There is plenty of educational material found on why dolphins don't do well on captivity. Take a look for yourself and educate yourself. Highly social and intelligent creatures that require the stimulation of the wild do not belong in small chlorinated pools being fed dead fish to do tricks. It's not ethical.

The Saint Lawrence Marine Eco-system is a stunning aquarium which replicates the underwater environment of Gulf of St. Lawrence. I saw cod, striped bass, halibut and salmon.  The Tropical Forest section was interesting too, as there were monkeys jumping across trees.

This was a huge disappointment. \n\nI'd like to know why it is about $2.50 more for Non-Quebec residents than it is for Quebec residents. I even paid LESS than what the price sign said. I paid $12.00 to get my ticket and the sign said $14.00 for a Quebec Resident, yet I was with my cousin and her husband from Cornwall Ontario, and they had to pay the full price of about $16.25 x 2 + $8.25 for their daughter of 9 yrs. It was an expensive trip for them and we toured it first so quickly that we did a second tour (for no extra charge). \n\nWhat saved the Biodome from a total failing grade is the fact that on the second time around, we were lucky enough to see animals that we actually did not see on the first tour. We were able to get amazing photos of the monkeys, fish, crocodiles, and beaver. My 9 year old cousin had a great time. I would return, but only if ALL of the sections are open so I'd would probably have to call first or visit the website for this information.\n\nI want to remark how I am a member of an animal welfare group. These animals look well cared for and I believe that they are. Their living ecosystems are huge. The 'sub-ecosystems' such as the otter area could be bigger, but that otter has been living there happily for many years. The beaver has more space to swim than it looks from the glass viewing area. That part is NOT the only space he has to swim. \n\nThanks for reading!",0.0,0.9908742904663086

One of the highlights of the zoo is the Penguin Parade, which usually happens around 1 o'clock. It does what it says on the tin, the penguins come out of the enclosure for a march around the perimeter. Its entertaining and it is humorous to see animals misbehave as there is always at least one trying to escape!  \n\nThere is plenty more to see. The Budongo Trail is a fairly new enclosure for the chimps which has viewing areas in every possible position so you don't miss a thing. There is an outdoor section with ropes and platforms where the chimps play with each other, I could sit for hours watching them. Its a really interesting enclosure and is a step up from your standard cage.\n\nThe selection of animals is like you would find in any zoo: from Lions to Porcupines and Zebras to Sea Lions. Note that the Polar Bear was moved up to Aviemore last year after 25 years at the zoo. \n\nThere is plenty of little food stalls and cafes selling ice creams, snacks, tea, coffee etc but these places are usually pretty overpriced.

Little play on words.  The whole damn zoo is built into a hill.  Right out of the gate, you're ascending.  The habitats are generously spaced with certain areas obviously better developed than others.  It's an unfortunate criticism but a logical realization of all zoos--the more popular animals live in better built habitats encouraging more flow traffic.  So the nearly arrived Pandas and the ever-popular penguins get top-billing while Zebras and Giant Anteaters are atop the very long and steep climb at the opposite end of the grounds.  All the shops, cafes, and the majority of bathrooms are all huddled by the Education center--which is across, you guessed it, the penguin exhibit.  It's a damn shame because the bird sanctuary was awesome once I finally discovered it (I had to be showed).  Defenders and those far more educated in zoo design will correctly correct me in saying that zebras (which I now pronounce \""zebra\"" instead of \""zeebra\"" thanks to my girlfriend) require considerable square footage and thus must always be segregated from the smaller habitats.  That's a valid point but...okay, that is a valid point.  I really have nothing to counter that with.  The penguins were cute, that's certainly a thing I can't deny.\n\nDo I have favorite animals?  I prefer ones where I can get close, not requiring physical contact, just where I can feel like the animal knows I exist.  Perhaps we are divided by glass or not, makes no difference, so large animals, though obviously breathtaking, are not as interesting as the small ones I can get close to.  So despite a lot of people placing the pandas atop the list of best habitats, I'd have to go with the penguins (huh, I guess it works).  I mean at one point, the crowds formed a path for the penguins to walk through.  They only do so a few times a day and its worth participating in.  I enjoyed the flamingos, because who doesn't, and everyone loves the squirrel and capuchin monkeys.  In all the experience was pleasant, worth the admission and an afternoon of your time.

The cool thing is you get to stand right at the pool's edge, so you can get some awesome shots less than 10 feet away.  That's the best part of it, so bring a nice camera.

The zoo shares its space with a recreation park so you're also competing for parking spaces with people going there as well.\n\nI was really disappointed when I found many exhibits closed, and there were no capybaras out (my favorite animal) if you happen to be in Madison, make this a stop, it's free; but don't make a special trip for it if you're not close.",0.0,0.9938983917236328

It's a smaller zoo, but with a great variety of animals.  It's easy to navigate and you are able to see everything is a fairly short period of time, which could be considered good or bad...for our family, it's good! ;)  They offer train rides and carousel rides for $1.50 per person, regardless of age. I think the carousel is worth it...the train, not so much. The train basically goes in a very short loop where you just see the backs of some buildings that you could just as easily walk around. There is a petting zoo and a giant play structure that is fun for older kids. \n\nThe biggest downfall of the zoo is the lack of parking.  If you are lucky, you will get a spot in the lot, but on busy weekends we've had to park multiple blocks away. I can forgive this little flaw since the zoo itself is FREE.  If you've got a little change to spare, be sure to throw it in the donation buckets located around the zoo. This year on a trip in July we were told they were already out of maps for the year - and there was no budget to print more. \n\nFinally, be aware that when they say the zoo closes at 5:00, they really mean 4. The petting zoo, the park, and all exhibits with doors are closed at 4.  They just leave the actual zoo open for another hour while they filter people out.  Don't go at 3:30 and think you will have a full hour and a half to explore or you will be disappointed.",0.0,0.993016004562378

Unfortunate situations always occur to her when she is just minding her own business.  She was just standing near the pool and watching the dolphins play when two of the male dolphins began to fight. The fight was so violent that both dolphins landed on the cement and began aggressively hitting there tails at each other. This was less than 2 feet away from my mom. My mom and another woman ran for their lives. Both dolphins were cut and bloody due to the severe fight, and flopped back into the water to continue the fight. The staff didn't say sorry and just explained to her and the other woman that male dolphins fight over territory. Of course it ruined my mom's trip. She came here to relax because the night before she got a phone call that informed her that her Dad had died. I should have brought her to the Mandalay Bay Shark thing. \nThe day just got worse at the Tiger and Lion exhibit. One of the tigers decided to take a piss towards the crowd of people watching.  I had no clue that a tiger could piss that far of a distance. The people all ran backwards, but thought it was funny. They were laughing because it missed them, but I bet if it actually hit them they would be pissed off as hell. \n\nSo, I guess this place ain't 100% safe. So my advice is to hold onto your young children, and don't let them get too close to the dolphin tanks.  \n\nIf management is reading this and thinks I am exaggerating, go check out the security tape and see for yourself. I came on 2/26/2012 around 3pm. \n\nA lot of crazy sh!t happens here btw...",0.0,0.9987138509750366

Otherwise you're going out of your way to see  a few lions sleeping. \nI admit, lions are not something you see every day and the opportunity to see even one (despite the fact that it's sleeping) is fairly awesome. But you arrive, wait patiently for a spot close to the glass to catch a glimpse of one, take a photo and then you just kind of stand there. And then after a minute of that you start think \""Wow, these are seriously beautiful creatures. It sucks that they're stuck in this artificial environment getting gawked at all day.\""  I felt a little dirty afterwards. \nI will say the habitat itself is beautiful! 9 million dollars worth of beautiful.\nThere's also an informative recording that plays every 5-10 minutes. It tells you about the habitat, the lions and gives helpful factoids. One of which was: Lions sleep 18-20 hours a day. They are not dancing monkeys. \n\nTo view the exhibit itself is free, but if you wanna shell out $25 bucks you and one other person can get your photo taken with a lion cub. \nI'm not gonna lie. They were reeeaaalllyyy f***ing cute!",0.0,0.6305675506591797

Here's the goods and bads of the Phoenix Zoo Lights...\n\nPOSITIVE: It had lights. It was outside. You go at your own pace. Some of the light set ups were pretty cool. There was a talking giraffe that you could interact with. There was a light show to music above the water. SRP gave out buy 1 get 1 free coupons. \n\nNEGATIVE: It costs $13 a person. The line to buy tickets was rediculiously long and slow moving. The line to get in was just as bad. The lights are ok but nothing like its made out to be and there aren't nearly as many as it seems. The trail you follow isn't very long meaning the exhibit wasn't very big. The amount of money they charge 1 person for a snack is more then you could feed a whole family dinner. The employees are rude and obviously aren't the \""people person\"" type. The slide, caresuell, zip line, and camal rides costs extra. There is not one real animal in sight. \n\nTo sum it up the experience was highly over rated, over priced and over populated! I'm glad I went so I can say \""been there, done that\"" but Im not sure which is worse... the amount of money the adventure costed or the horrible disappointment I felt when it was over!",0.0,0.9970955848693848
