Valentino Santa Monica is also for sale too. Again, there's that lingering old restaurant.com coupon that reminds us to use it or lose it.\n\nWhenever I visit the Spring Mountain intersection of The Strip, my chauffeur will park the Yu-go in the Palazzo.  For those who don't know, the Palazzo and the The Venetian are owned by the same holding company. To make walking convenient, the two monster casinos are connected by a mall of shops and restaurants.\n\nOn our way to Valentino in the Venetian, Carnevale is being remembered by engaging live music and surreal Venetian characters. It's festivities are colorful, attention gathering and entertaining to welcome the beginnings of summer and a cheerful  reminder of the historical Venetian victory.\n\nThe Carnevale is also distracting  to the wait staff but doesn't lessen our dining experience.  I had previously mentioned the name Luciano Pellegrini who has earned all sorts of culinary accolades. The best of the best in the culinary industry. There are six menus for different venues and meals. Tonight we're ordering from The Grill Dinner Menu:\n\nSpaghetti with Meat Balls & Marinara\nLaCostoletta: Pan Roasted Veal Chop Parmigiana served with Mashed Potatoes\nLamb Chops: Scottadito Tossed With Garlic And Thyme Flavored Butter \nGrilled Vegetables or Mashed Potatoes are also included. Yu-go selected the Grilled Vegetables minus asparagus. Not good for gout prevention.\n\nRemember I said Canevale didn't  lessen our dining experience.  If anything the courses were totally embarrassing for our appetite.  The breads together with the spaghetti dish were prepared to perfection.  It's strange that I would say this about such a common dish, but it's true.  Next our LaCostoletta and Lamb Chops arrived sizzling with fragrances that made us forget everything else happening at that moment in time.  No desserts or coffee, we end up taking half of our dinner home to enjoy again. \n\nThe ambiance is delicate, refined and now very dated following fourteen years of existence.

Being the grandma that I am I was terribly happy to be sitting next to a 90 year old couple and a group of women in their 70s all dressed up for a night out (so cute!!) The impeccable service at Picasso was worth every penny of the $150 share of my bill. Be forewarned, it is of course a prix-fix menu of either $113 for something like 3 courses or $150 for 5 (i forget). They were even courteous enough to offer some of my friends $50 entrees instead since we weren't told about the prix-fix menu. \n\nWe began with a cr\u00e8me of carrot and ginger soup which was immensely refreshing and compliments of the chef. I continued with the warm quail salad with saut\u00e9ed artichokes and pinenuts. I've also heard their ragout of seasonal vegetables with fresh foie gras and jus de poularde is incredible so if your a fan of foie gras, part of me feels like this is where it might be just as good as paris. I then continued with the venison on a bed of risotto rice which is not game-y at all and very delightful. Surprisingly I forget what I had for dessert but I know it was delicious. I think it was a chocolate souffle. They also brought out a tray of chocolate treats for the table. \n\nI'm very big on the small details and Picasso was attentive to every one of them. They weren't rude at all when we took too much time ordering, were the last people to stay until closing, or when our inappropriate comments were heard over the quiet chatter of the dining room. \n\nIf you're planning on venturing here make sure you come to spend a lot of money, definitely get the wine the sommelier recommends, (he was incredible), and grab a seat on the patio if its warm or by the window to see the bellagio watershow if its chilly. \n\nBon Apetit!",1.0,0.997244358062744

What a beautiful french restaurant with great outdoor seating. We ate here for Sunday brunch and sipped our Bellinis while we ate french baguette with jelly and butter. The eggs benedict was delicious as well as the corn beef hash. My only concern with this restaurant is the service. Our waiter was not with it at all. We had to ask twice for a soda, it finally came when the meal arrived. There were four girls in our party and 2 of the meals came out and it took about 5 minutes for the other 2 to be delivered. When I am paying close to $30/plate I think the meals and sodas should come out on time and together. I don't know. It was a nice place and the food was good but in Vegas the food is good at so many places. Make your way to Mon Ami Gabbi if you are in need of a French cafe fix.",1.0,0.9859856367111206

[the sister restaurant to The Cheesecake Factory.] It is definitely a must go whenever i'm in Vegas. \n\nI've always experienced great service every time I've eaten here and don't expect anything less than the friendly and attentive wait staff. This is a great place to go for delicious affordable food and nice atmosphere at any time of the day. -- They're open 24/7! \n\nThe burgers are absolutely delicious and are HUGE! I always cut them in half and end up eating the second half later on. They also have yummy pasta dishes and soup and sandwich combos. My favorite thing that i ordered was the spicy crispy chicken burger; just the right amount of spice with all the right toppings and served with their tasty french fries! \n\nI definitely recommend checking this restaurant out whether you're looking for a place for lunch after shopping and walking the strip or a place for dinner before a night on the town!",1.0,0.9996100068092346

Wynn, even in all it's glory and splendor, is no exception.  Terrace Pointe Cafe, just a few steps beyond the Buffet offers a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees and sits quite comfortably in that lonely, yet elusive space between Wynn's numerous high-end fine dining choices and their buffet.\n\nFor the most part, the menu contains standard cafe items with a Wynn flare, i.e. the decadent lobster benedicts and kobe beef sliders.  I thoroughly enjoyed my spaghetti bolognase at 11:00am on a Sunday morning, so I give them props for that.  Bottomline: this cafe has a friendly, very attentive staff and the food is comprable to the cafes you'll find at Bellagio, Paris or Venetian hotels.",1.0,0.9990262985229492

We had the pre fix, not that the price was the problem just that the food was mediocre at best and when considering an establishment for a decent dining experience one would think you would not be served individual wraped breakfast butters with your bread basket :).  The beef carpaccio was prosciutto with an arugala salad on top, the veal parmesan was pretty delicious, well seasoned and tender and the pastry shop deserts were lack lustre and unimpressive.  The staff was attentive and wonderful and gave us great service. Unfortunately the atmosphere and ambiance was like sitting in the food court in a themed italian chateaux.   Well it is the venetian casino so I should have known better.  We were looking for something a little more high end with a culinary experience and I feel it fell short.  When in vegas make the trip out to Nora's italian restaurant if you want some GREAT and fabulous italian food in vegas.",0.0,0.959868311882019
