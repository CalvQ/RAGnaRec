All the negative had me worried, but I guess I can't complain to much because it was free on my part.\n\nWe were in little corner of the room, squishing all 25 people (really warm in there too).  The waitresses came around, who were pretty nice, and asked for our drinks.  About maybe 10-15 minutes later the salads came out.  They were passing around the bowls and each got whatever amount salad they wanted.  The salads were nothing special, just the greens and the dressing. \n\nAfter eating the bland salad, they gave out some spaghetti and cheese ravioli.  The spaghetti tasted very watered down and the meat seemed like there wasn't any spices to it.  I've had better spaghetti with just Prego sauce and cheap angel hair noodles.  The ravioli were a little better, but nothing worth what they paid for.\n\nI feel bad for them with how much they spent.  Could of totally found a better place for a lot less",0.0,0.9987688660621644
