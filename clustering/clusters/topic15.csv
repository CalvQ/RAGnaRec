Yep, he's a big dork.  I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with my standard veggie lo mein while the bf ventured out and had the Cherry Special Chicken.  We also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon.\n\nWell, the lo mein, first of all, was not lo mein at all.  It was actually chow mein and that did not really work for me since I prefer the wide, flat noodle usually found in lo mein dishes.  It was fairly bland and the veggies were scarce.   I mean, c'mon, it's veggie lo mein!  Give me something here!  The crab rangoon filling was nothing short of disgusting....it tasted like either ricotta cheese or curdled, mealy cream cheese.  Yuck!\n\nThe Cherry Special Chicken, however, was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up sharing with the bf because his food was way better than mine.  The sauce was a sweet/spicy combo and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e. not too greasy).  The only downside:  the cherries were of the marischino variety and tasted just like what you would expect: like they came from the bottom of a Shirley Temple.  Overly sweet and not so appetizing.  \n\nA mixed review all in all.....maybe if I branched out and tried something different, but I think next time, I will just go pick it up from somewhere else.",1.0,0.7950605750083923

On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \""Hong Kong style\"" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \""chow mein\"" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \""lo mein\"" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?\n\nAt Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.\n\nThat said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13?

Had their Tangerine beef which was good, but I would like to see a tad LESS Tangerine bits in the dish. Tasty nonetheless.

We decided to try it on Sunday after church.

Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.  \n\nThe inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's.  One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \""no talking while you eat\"".\n\nThe food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce.  I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about.  At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it.  All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch.

This place has a great following and they seemed to know every customer by first names!\n\nI ordered a Stir-fried Chicken dish, one I have never had nor heard of with: Bok Choy, Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions.

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

So the wedding reception was a great opportunity.\n\nI would say all my friends were right. Imperial Garden is a mix between authentic chinese food and american chinese food. The peking duck and the appetizer platter were my favorite. The appetizer platter (serves 4) consisted of Egg rolls, grilled pot stickers, bbq pork, crispy shrimp and calamari. Pot stickers were nicely made and flavorful, calamari is also crispy *yums* Shrimps are lightly breaded and very tasty, could taste how fresh they are. \n\nThe Peking Duck is also super awesome. Note that you have to order the duck a day in advance. It's a whole duck specially prepared and served in three courses, of which the crispy duck skin with mandarin pancakes is my favorite. Super authentic! You can ask for more pancakes with the dish, yes it is this good! \n\nOther dishes we tried include the usual general tso chicken, mongolian pork, stir fry noodles.

I ordered my go to - cashew chicken - and my friend ordered one of her go to's - fried rice with beef - and we were both NOT impressed. Second bite into my chicken, and it's HARD. Like BONE hard. Eew. And my friend's fried rice had so much egg in it, it took up a quarter of her plate after picking the egg out of a third of her dish. Like, we know protein is important, but there are other food groups too, ya know? The best parts of my cashew chicken were the cashews and the white rice - which if you don't know - are impossible to mess up. So we wait for our bill, like forever, and when we finally get it, there are our fortune cookies! I open mine, and it has the fortune sticking out, and she opens hers, and BOOM. No fortune. That's like the whole reason we're doing this. We love those fortunes. Disappointment. Wah. Anyway. The chicken was bad quality, I've had much better. The pieces that weren't hard were dark meat - very spongy. But they fill up that soy sauce bottle real good, because we used over half of it, so that's a plus. Prices weren't bad either.

The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations.

Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.

The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.

Not the overly sweet sauces of americanized Chinese food, but edgier stuff.\n\nWhile living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).\n\nWell, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.\n\nI have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.  \n\nDan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.\nChinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant.\nBeef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.  We love to get rice with it to sop up as much juice as we can.  though we have been told by friends that broth is simply there to cook the meat and veggies, not to eat as a soup.\n\nWe have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.  \n\nThe Service - many comment on the service - OK it is only so so.  Last time we were there they never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  Had to ask them to clear dishes etc.  Not really rude, just not what we are used to in restaurants.  I wont let this curtain our dinning there, I count it as part of the experience.",1.0,0.7561067342758179

The fried rice was simple and didn't have crazy extras like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts. Two hearty scoops of fried rice and an egg roll plus my swee and sowa pohkk ... Great food and very hearty portions and left with a bill less than $10 with tip. Can't get that at panda, and unlike Panda, it didn't do the express blowout 30 minutes later in the office bathroom.

I lamented the lack of lemon chicken, a favorite of mine from when I came here over 20 years ago.\n\nWas it the price? $7 and change for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection isn't much to look at and the food itself doesn't stand out either. Service is kept to a minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda of your choice is brought to a table chosen for you while you load up your plate. Empty plates are taken away regularly, and food is replenished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it sounds like a lot of cooking is happening.\n\nWas it the ambience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the sounds of the cooking behind the scenes nearly drowned out by the sound of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable DVD player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did 20 years ago, shaped vaguely like alien faces from the classic 1950's version of 'War of the Worlds'?\n\nThe truth is that it was all of these things. Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love those wonton crisps!), the service is minimal, and the price is right. But Golden Coin remains today mostly like what it was 20+ years ago, right down to the worn tables and the alien-face plates.

Despite the less-than-elegant decor, this restaurant has a certain charm to it.\n\nI've been coming here with my family for about 20 years and it's still my restaurant of choice for Chinese food. The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty, but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup. It's thick, flavorful and I have yet to find a rival anywhere. Great dishes include the Mongolian beef, cashew chicken and house special chicken. Americans everywhere have their favorite, must order Chinese food dish and I'm willing to bet you'll find a pleasant version of it at Dragon Palace. \n\nThe best time to go is at lunch! It's quick and cheap. Their lunches, which come with a generous helping of your choice of dish (say kung pao chicken), rice, egg roll, 2 wontons and either egg drop or wonton soup are less than $6, most around $5. If you're REALLY on a budget, order a bowl of egg drop soup for only $1. \n\nThe only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these! \n\nIf you're craving Chinese food, stop and eat here or pick up a to-go order and eat it in whatever environment you choose!",1.0,0.8636114597320557

Of youth, fun and friends. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to eat here again. I had not done so in years (more then 5, less then 10). I took a new friend and ordered my old favorite, House Special Chicken. It was just as I remembered it. Crispy fried outside, sitting in a ginger and garlic sauce (I love it when food in a sauce is still crisp). My friend approved of her Sesame Chicken but I didn't try any of it, myself. \n\nOne bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip. \n\nI wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again. \n\nWhat did the critics say? \""It all really good, mijo.\"" Success. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food. I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty, stick-to-your-ribs, let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food, Dragon Palace is hard to beat. The dark, quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too, so I say, eat-in if you can.",1.0,0.9935259819030762

Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.\n\nThe waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (\""Express yourself now.\"" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.\n\nAll in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.",1.0,0.989432454109192

First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.) \n\nWhen we got our takeout home, we were hopeful. All of my fellow Yelper's reviews were so glowing. Now I'm convinced that every person who rated it with 5 stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies- but I'm not sure as we didn't eat in. \n\nOur food was inedible. I'm serious- and usually once I've shelled out a few bucks for something I'll at least hunker down and eat it, but instead I'd rather go hungry tonight. And my husband will eat ANYTHING, so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that I'm not just some crazy snob who doesn't like the food (and Chinese is never a bad choice for me, I've never given up.) The sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Bland and mushy. The schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken. Tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed (not fresh at all), and in some sort of spicy-ketchup sauce. The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating, but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap. I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for \""Chicken of the Sea.\"" Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.\n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza. \n\nNever again will I eat here.

Everyone was checking their signs and their families signs and joking around about it. A nice distraction while waiting for our order. Service was great. They had no problem doing multiple checks and the food came out pretty quick. So did the drinks. The wait staff, which I think were the owners, were very attentive. Drinks always refilled and asking us if we worked in the area and where we worked. Also asked us if we had been there before. When we said no they brought us over take out menus.\nNow to the food. It was so good. Best Chinese food I have had in awhile. I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan. The white sauce that was on it was amazing. The chicken and veggies were perfect and the fried rice was really good. Everybody raved about their different meals. Not one complaint. They got us in and out with plenty of time to get back to work. That was even with 5 people in our group.\nI will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu.

This fact notwithstanding, I have to admit that its definitely not my favorite Chinese food restaurant in the area. They advertise themselves as New York Style Chinese food, which, since I'm not from New York, doesnt mean a whole lot to me. Though from what I've tasted, I'm assuming that means not as authentic and a little Americanized. The one thing that constantly frustrates me about Red Dragon is that I order something having a guess about how its going to be and it ends up being nothing like it. Once I ordered the crispy chicken thinking it would be the deep fried chicken with crispy skin that you can get in most Chinese restaurants, and it ended up being this shaved, deep fried chicken in a sweet sauce. Utterly disappointing, though it wasnt necessarily a bad dish. The fried rice here is hit or miss- a hit being a passable version, while a miss ends up being partially cooked rice \""crispies\"". Their egg foo yung is pretty good, and their -enter choice of meat- with broccoli/veggies is well done, if not a little too oily. The one thing I like about this place especially is their soups, which are very inexpensive- $3 for a quart- though they are premade and the amount of ingredients reflects the price. But I actually like simplicity so it suits me just fine.  Unfortunately, for most of the things on the menu, and I've tried quite a few, there is sweet undertone accompanying them. Also, a quick note...this place has only 3 small tables, so unless you are a very small party or eating a quick meal, I would opt for the take-out.\n\nThe one great advantage they have over other places is, as others have mentioned, the price, and also that they are open till 10 on most nights. If another restaurant is open, I'll usually skip Red Dragon, but if I have to choose between so-so Chinese food and Taco Bell just up the street, its really no decision at all.",0.0,0.6269321441650391

Second clue ... after ordering, the waitress said, \""That comes with white rice.\""  To say that to a Chinese couple is like a slap in the face.  Of course it should come with white rice!  The food is edible, but I wouldn't rave about it .  I could make the same dishes at home for a fraction of the price. The previous review by Flippitti is right on.  It's certainly not worth the prices.  In fact, the size of the portions you are served make it a complete ripoff.  We had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp.  I am 5'1\"" and 105 lbs. and could have eaten both orders by myself.  Needless to say, we left hungry and $36 poorer.  The salt and pepper shrimp is traditionally made with the shell still on and at some Chinese restaurants with the head on.  Their version (we assume to cater to American tastes) is made without the shells.  In order to accomplish this, they coat the shrimp with a dry, cardboard tasting flour mixture.

I was like \""Finally a good Chinese restaurant!\"".  The broth itself was very tasty and so were the meats.  I fed my son (2 yr old) the wonton first because that's something he would like.  Upon first examining it, I noticed that it didn't look cooked but I assumed that that's probably the type of wonton they used.  My son ate it and spit it out. So I tasted it and it was uncooked.  It was still cold and doughy.  I was very bummed that I gave it to my little boy and that the soup was ruined.  Then I tried the napa cabbage and it was bitter...like old veggie bitter.  I told my kids to stop eating and when the server returned I told him the issue and he took it off my bill.  Then the entrees came out. The mongolian beef was very mediocre.  Mongolian Beef is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and it wasn't up to par at all with what I've had in the past, very  very plain.  The Chow Mein had good flavoring and my kids enjoyed the dish but the veggies were really raw and bitter.  So I decided to just box everything up and head home.  When I got home and warmed up the Chow Mein, I looked at the veggies again and saw black spots on them.  They were seriously over due and should have been tossed out instead of cooked or added to dishes for their guest.  We will not be going back to this place.

The owner is a somewhat friendly Chinese immigrant who recognizes his regulars. The egg roll is a tasty greasy spring roll that comes with that comforting sweet n sour sauce. The egg drop soup is tasty with hot sauce but I absolutely love their hot and sour-- feels great when you've got a sore throat or allergies acting up. I've had just about everything on the menu. The Mongolian beef is tasty but a bit chewy. The cashew chicken isn't bad but I much prefer the Kung pao chicken. The orange chicken here tastes familiar to the Chinese food fan but is still considerably better than your average fast food fare. I recommend  the house special chicken which has the sweetness of orange chicken but the added spice of sauteed red peppers and some vegetable. The fried rice here is nothing to write home about so I usually opted for the white for health preferences.  The portions are rather generous here so expect to be stuffed everytime you eat lunch here. Green tea goes well with the meal and is pretty cheap.\nI really don't suggest you come here expecting an amazing dinner-- its more of a casual lunch spot.

Don't come expecting anything fabulous. \n\nThe Miso Cod was downright buttery and delicious. It's a decently sized piece of Cod filet cooked to perfection. \n\nMy husband got the Pork Udon Stir Fry which was good as well.\n\nThe thing I came for, the Honey Toast, is exactly what it sounds like...a big hunk of toast with honey drizzled all over it and two scoops of vanilla ice cream.

I do not care if you read that it was one of the ten best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. Whoever wrote all those reviews in any of the restaurant review magazines, websites, and articles giving this restaurant a positive light should be shot. Twice.\n\nI decided to use the 10best website to find myself an interesting place to eat, and discovered that my favorite one--Joyful--was number 10. Thinking that their taste was opposite of mine, I chose their number 9 spot-Sam's BBQ-and headed to Spring Mountain Rd. and Arville to try it out. First, Chinatown has horrible parking, so I circled for five minutes before stealing a space from some pissed off old man. After that, I walked into the restaurant, not impressed at all by the scenery.\n\nAs you walk in, there is a barbecue to-go station right in front of you. A small entryway to the overcrowded (fire inspectors should check this place out for safety) dining area. The hostess was not there, and it took us another five minutes to be recognized to be seated. Their menus felt greasy, only indicating how clean the place would be. I was worried the minute that I touched the menus about my food, but I was a trooper and pressed on.\n\nSince this place is a barbecue place, we ordered bbq pork (you know, the one with that red outer coating), honey walnut shrimp, and house special chow mein. The waiter rushed us to order, stood there with an irritated look when we tried to change our minds, and finally--and literally--ran off after closing the ordering with a rude \""yeah\"". The food took about eight minutes, and the table next to us returned a bowl of soup after discovering dead flies (yes, SEVERAL) in her bowl. In the end, she still had to pay for it, mind you.\n\nWe receive our dishes and steamed rice that I was hesitant to eat. I've seen too many incidences whre rice is recycled from one table to another, but I had a bit because I could not have my walnut shrimp without it.\n\nIn short--for Chinese people who run this place, I believe they were raised in hicktown USA. They do not make good or even decent food. I am one to eat what I buy, but in this case, I couldn't torture myself any longer.\n\nTo be nice, I'll leave out the gorey details and state that it was the worst Chinese food I ever had in my lifetime.\n\nDo not expose yourself to this place.

Everything I've tried in my several visits to this place have been fantastic. My favorite dish was the claypot fish. \n \nIt gets crowded during dinner so best to come early.

I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Much to my delight it was a hit. The other hit was the stir fried duw miu sprouts with abalonushrooms. The gravy was very tasty and the sprouts had the hot wok taste. The empress chicken was acceptable, but it seemed more like regular bak jam gai instead of empress chicken (gwei fei gai). The big disappointment was the beef in XO sauce. I could not taste the XO sauce at all and the beef was a pile of thinly sliced cheap meat, not like the tender little cubes of high quality meat used in a really good version of this dish.\n\nThis place is definitely HK style, with the fish tanks, spartan decor, and dirty bathrooms. Contrary to HK style, the service was surprisingly good. They were very attentive and changed our plates midway and ran over with napkins when my Dad spilled water. However, the service did taper off near the end and they were busy with the large number of customers rushing in.\n\nThe final sting came when we received our bill, which was $64 for the three of us including tip. This is on the high range of what I'd expect to pay for HK style cooking, maybe at a \""high end\"" restaurant, without the word express in the name.\n\nBest chinese food in Vegas? Possibly.

It also boasts using 100% vegetable oil and NO MSG.

The inside was diner-like, a bit rustic and in some need of updating.  There might have been about five small tables to eat-in.  The kitchen where the food is cooked is almost fully exposed so you can watch all of the action take place right in front of you.  Calling your order in at a Chinese restaurant isn't really necessary since everytime you call an order in for Chinese food, don't they always say \""okay, 10 minuss\"" (sic, please do not take offense, as I am Asian too--just silly!).  \n\nAnyway, we got our food home and dug in.  The portions were very large.  The General Tso's Chicken was \""tasty\"" as my source called it yet \""average.\""  My chicken w/broccoli was good but lacked the taste of ginger, garlic, and sugar (the New York part).  However, the broccoli and carrots were fresh and the chicken was all tender white meat.  When our bellies were full, our tins of food still looked full!  I also must add the white rice was perfect and I was told the fried rice was \""good.\""\n\nThis comment isn't meant to slight the restaurant but, I don't know if we'll order from here again, as there are WAY TOO MANY Chinese restaurants to try with Chinatown being so close to us!

Probably would have been nice if it had been served with some sweet and sour sauce but I was too lazy to ask for some.\nI ordered the szechuan chicken, an item that you don't always see at your typical chinese fast food restuarants. It was decent-- fair amount of sliced chicken served with sliced onion, bell pepper, carrots, ginger and glazed in a dark sauce. It was quite salty and did not require additional soy sauce ( i imagine that was already added) and the spiciness seemed to come from some sort of pepper oil. It was spicy enough to satisfy my palate-- I didn't feel the need to ask for additional hot sauce. I was satisfactorily filled and thanked them for a pleasant meal.\n\nThe verdict: Nothing special to say here, this is your run of the mill sit down chinese restaurant.

For some reason Vegas has really terrible Chinese food and I'm usually relieved if I don't get food poisoning from it. In New York and Fort Lauderdale there is some AMAZING Chinese food and the delivery guy will get to you in ten minutes even if it is pouring rain outside. Anyway, if I was grading this place based on all of the Chinese food I've ever had I would give it two stars. If I were grading on a curve (since we are in Vegas) I'd give it about 3 and a half stars. I decided to rate it in the middle as a result.\n\nNow let's breakdown the food: my girlfriend and I ordered the Poo Poo Platter as well as the Kungpow Shrimp and the Broccoli Beef. The Poo Poo Platter consisted of Crab Ragoons that were 90% cream cheese. Meh. The Egg Rolls were good smothered in chili garlic sauce and soy sauce, but they were some of the greasiest things I've ever eaten. Then there was a sweet pork thing on a skewer, not a ton of meat on it and I just wasn't a fan. There was this weird piece of chicken wrapped in tinfoil that seemed like it was baked in soy sauce and it was DELICIOUS. My favorite part of the whole meal. I would eat that again.The shrimp in the Kungpow Shrimp was good, but everything else kind of sucked. There was a ton of waterchesnuts in the Kungpow Shrimp and I hate waterchesnuts, but there was also a ton of undercooked zucchini that gave the dish a really crunchy texture. Ew. Also, the sauce on the kungpow shrimp wasn't even spicy. Maybe they gave me the wrong dish? I don't know. The beef in the broccoli beef was chewy and the sauce was sweet. My girlfriend liked it, but I didn't. I did like the Broccoli Beef better than the Kungpow Shrimp though. Also, the Broccoli Beef didn't heat up well and I didn't even bother to eat the Kungpow Shrimp.\n\nI'm really surprised that this place has such amazing reviews. I may have gotten a crappy meal because I ordered right before they closed, but I asked if that was okay and the woman on the phone said yes. If she had said no it wouldn't have been a problem and I would've just called somewhere else. I am not impressed and I'm not ordering from Golden Flower again.

First warning sign is that the restaurant is in the decaying and basically uninhabited Pecos Plaza. \n2nd warning sign; upon entering the place it was packed by obese Caucasians (except for two slender men) and very few Asians.\n3rd warning sign; when I asked for chopsticks the waitress laughed and walked off.   I use chopsticks at home as I find it paces my eating and allows me to be more in touch with my food.   With a fork it is far too easy to just shovel it in.\n\nThe reason for 1 star is there is no option for zero.   The two waitresses acted as if they were not wanting to be working and barely interacted with the customers.   I realize that in some Chinese restaurants service can be slow or haphazard but this place takes it to a new low level. \n\nThe food quality is good but flavorless.  I had the chicken bok choy lunch special.   It comes with soup, an eggroll and 3 cups of white rice.  Oh and also the flatest understuffed crab rangoon in the world.  While the chicken and bok choy tasted fresh it was swimming is a glossy brown sauce that tasted like watered down soy sauce with a little corn starch thrown in.  I avoided the rice, egg roll and very flat crab rangoon as they did not look appealing. \n\nWhile I picked through my lunch I witnessed one customer walk out because it was 30 mins and they had no food.  Mine took 15 minutes.  Instead of calling this a Chinese restaurant it should be labeled as an American restaurant with a Chinese influence.   I think the only reason this place manages to stay in business is because their Caucasian clientele doesn't know what good and authentic Chinese food tastes or  looks like. \nI rarely give negative reviews but this place pushed all the wrong buttons today.",0.0,0.9947413206100464

As soon as you walk in, you can tell that's its in a different league altogether from those hole-in-the-wall places.  The service is attentive and efficient, and also quite polite.  The food was prepared quickly.  The restaurant has a lot of white and on the whole seemed airy and open, with nice table cloths and red cloth napkins.  It had the makings of a fine-dining restaurant.  \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was just okay.  It was not particularly amazing, and you could tell that they did not eschew the use of MSG to pump up the flavor of their dishes.  The chicken was soft and tender, and not dry and chewy like other restaurants, and the shrimp was plumb and fresh.  It was just a little bland, that's all.  A bit of soy sauce would help this, as would some salt and pepper, but you have to specifically ask for it, because they not placed on the table (takes away from the atmosphere, I'd guess).  \n\nLast word will be on the prices.  You're paying a lot more here than you would at most Chinese places.  Chow mein for $12?  At lunch time, even?  It's a little steep.

Yes, I'm a pushover and I take her pretty much anywhere she wants to go.\n\nI figured, \""why not?\"" I'll give it a whirl. Upon walking in, the atmosphere is incredible. It has a higher class appearance than other dining establishments of its kind. They really went the extra mile to make a nice-looking restaurant, with no annoyances or distractions. Like most other Chinese restaurants around town, this one does have delivery and take-out options.\n\nThe menu has a ton of options, and nearly everything I have had a chance to try here has been very good. Not the best Chinese in the Vegas Valley, but it's definitely good stuff. If you're a fan of Chinese food, you'll most likely enjoy what you get. \n\nThis brings me to my two complaints. First and foremost, the menu does not have pictures of the items or descriptions of them. Casual diners won't know what a good deal of this stuff means. I shouldn't have to ask the waitress what something is - the menu should tell me that. \n\nAnd then comes the BIG complaint - these prices are SKY HIGH. This is the most expensive Chinese restaurant I have ever visited. The food and atmosphere are excellent, but they do not justify said prices. There have been times when I have been able to feed a family of 3 or 4 at Outback (down the street) on less money than it costs 2 to eat here. \n\nIf you've got the money, Amlee has fine food and a great atmosphere.

If it weren't for their ridiculously expensive prices, I would definitely come here more often because I find it quite challenging to find delicious Chinese food in the Las Vegas area.\n\nThey put a twist in some of their dishes. Some of their menu items go beyond the traditional Chinese food items. For instance, their duck isn't prepared roasted or peking style; it's breaded. The sauce that comes with the duck is so so good; sweet and tangy and NOT hoisen sauce which made it a great compliment for this dish. I kind of feel that their food leans toward a more Americanized palate rather than OG Chinese, which, don't get me wrong, isn't bad. I'm not sure what their specialties leaned more toward since I'm not very knowledgeable on the difference between cantonese/mandarin dishes, but their quality is superb. \n\nEverytime I've had the opportunity to dine in, it hasn't been busy. I don't want this place to go out of business because it's one of the few Chinese places in the valley I would dine at. Maybe it's their location and prices that deter people from coming but I hope that the service and food, at least their food, will outweigh their prices.\n\nGreat place to dine in and at least this isn't the most expensive Chinese food joint, with similar quality and flair that I've had the pleasure of dining it.",1.0,0.9448930025100708

I've come to expect similar experiences wherever I choose to dine.\n\nHowever, during a recent trip to Las Vegas, my expectations were, for lack of a better term, pissed on! My friends decided to have dim sum at Cathay House Chinese Cuisine. They claimed that this place served good Chinese food. I've come to decide that they lied to me!\n\nDining here was an absolute WTF moment for me. For one, the food was subpar. The rolls were not baked fully, and the chicken feet lacked flavor, yet were swimming in suspicious looking sauce. My sweet and sour chicken was neither sweet nor sour - the cook apparently could not be bothered to put sauce on my dish. I will say their noodles were . . . edible, but a little salt would have gone a long way.\n\nThe food aside, the piss poor customer service was criminal! Apparently, the staff at Cathay have clearly designated roles from which they would not deviate. Every time I'd ask a food server for something, they'd tell me, rather rudely, \""That's the waiter's job, not mine.\"" Twice when we asked for more water, we were told everyone at the table already had a glass (did the service staff not notice our glasses were empty? We were in a desert, and needed our hydration!). My favorite WTF moment came when I asked for a fork. I got a baby-sized plastic fork to use instead. Did I fail to mention that any request we made was \""honored\"" with dirty looks?\n\nMy friends were horrified, I was pissed, and the pennies we left behind as a tip hopefully conveyed our displeasure with Cathay House of Chinese Cuisine.

Seriously, there's practically one for every week of the year.  How Lee was our choice because we had an AllMenus coupon code for $10 off, so that was essentially a free entree.  Sold!  We ordered a scallion pancake, which I haven't had in years and was essentially dreaming about all this time, the Triple  Szechuan Delight (shrimp, beef, vegetables in \""brown sauce\""), and chicken fried rice because we're cool.\n\nWhen we went to pick it up, the place was PACKED.  Lots of Asian families eating big pots of delicious looking food, and lots of white people standing around waiting for take out.  Sounds like this is one of those places with an American menu, and a Chinese menu.  We are pretty adventurous eaters typically, but since this was our first time at How Lee, we figured we'd start simple.  We waited about 10 more minutes after getting there, and I had to fight through the crowds to get to the front to pick up my food.  So it took about 25 minutes total for the food to be ready - kind of a while, but given the crowd I'm not surprised.\n\nWe took the food home, and nommed it.  I loved the scallion pancake - they're really simple and I've never had one that was different than any other, but the greasy, crispy consistency keeps me coming back.  Yum!  Fried rice was okay - I've had it better at other places (I think I liked it a lot at Pacific Ring).  My boyfriend really liked the Szechuan dish - it was only a little bit spicy, and the sauce did have the glossy Chinese food consistency, but the taste was pretty good.

I liked this because I could speak with them without much trouble, but this is where I thought the food might have been a bit lacking. We got our usual, which is fish fillets in spicy broth and pea shoots. The pea shoots were a bit on the tough side (might just have been due to what was available) and we were able to get the fish fillets a bit more mild than usual. Maybe getting it mild was where we went wrong - Sad to say, but the fish fillets at China Star are significantly better. Allow me to explain just a bit - the fish fillet dish at How Lee's was a bit ... cantonesed (i.e., they had thickened up the soup base with corn starch, which is a pretty typical cantonese thing to do). Also, the fish fillets were a bit on the doughy side, which I think probably had everything to do with the fish they used. \n\nAnyway, this is not a crazy indictment - it was still really good Chinese food, especially by Pittsburgh standards.

Most are in the $11.00 to $15.00 range.  My favorite is Seafood Delight which is  shrimp, scallops, lobster tail and assorted seafood sauteed with vegetable in white sauce.  When I want to splurge, I get the lobster dishes for $24.95.  The egg rolls here are fresh and they melt in your mouth.  I also like for an appetizer the pork dumplings, either fried or steamed.  MMMMM!, I think I'll tell my husband that the fridge broke and we need to go out for dinner tonight!",1.0,0.9953663349151612

Glad I did, because I'm now a fan.\n\nIt's definitely better than Phong May House (see my review if you want to compare). I think my initial reservations about going here revolved around what it looked like from the outside, and to some degree what it looks like on the inside as well. It's in the Crafton Ingram Shopping Center and it looks like a dive. But it's a great dive. There are tables for dine-in eating, but I'd say more than 90% of Chan An's business is take out. They don't do delivery.\n\nBut that's no big deal, as the food is always ready in about ten minutes, unless they're really busy, in which case it'll be twenty. So what's good here? \n\nWell, for starters, I love the wonton soup. Chan An uses a dark broth that is actually packed with flavor, unlike all the other Chinese eateries in the area which stick to a chicken-based broth, which is always flavorless for the most part. I don't get how that happens. Someone please explain it to me. The lack of flavor, not the base, that is.\n\nI'm a fan of the sweet and sour pork here, as well as the cashew chicken. I've noticed Chan An likes to use lightly battered dark meat pieces of chicken with a darker sauce when it comes to some of their dishes such as the cashew chicken. It can sometimes be a little salty, but most days it's right on the money. Plus they also throw in water chestnuts, which I love and wish more Chinese restaurants would do. \n\nThe egg rolls are really good. Not greasy, not overdone, but just right. The fried wontons are good and the beef on the stick is amazing. It's not your usual beef on a stick. Well, it is, but then they wind up deep frying the beef before skewering it, and I've never had it like that, but it's really tasty. It bring out the sweetness of the beef really well.\n\nThe people who run the place are super friendly and they'll do their best to accommodate your tastes if you want something made a little differently. The prices are good and in line with other affordable Chinese restaurants. So don't let the look of the place fool you. Chan An does a lot of business and I'd say that's mostly down to the quality of their food. Convenience is nice, too, but that doesn't always make for tasty eats.

This is where my now-husband and I had our first official date many years ago and where we went the night he proposed. We don't keep going for sentiment, but for the food. My favorite dish is the beef with broccoli mainly because the brown sauce they use is delicious and the broccoli is fresh. My husband enjoys their general tsos chicken, paper shrimp, wontons, and chicken with broccoli. His brothers really enjoy their hibachi dishes. If you enjoy vegetables, the hibachi dishes are a very good deal. We go there often enough that there have been a few off nights, but their off nights have been very few and far between for us. We both dine in and do take out. We do both lunch and dinner. One dish I haven't had much luck with is an appetizer, their bbq spare ribs. They're flavorless except for the oil they're cooked with. I haven't had much luck with bbq regular or boneless spare ribs in Chinese restaurants around town anyway so it's not a deal breaker by any means. The service can be hit or miss depending on which severs you have, how well they're staffed that day, and how new the staff is. Some days you may have to grab several different servers as they dash around to get what you need, but they're typically eager to please and easy to work with.",1.0,0.9679881930351256

I was promptly greeted and seated and presented with some sauces and a bowl of crispy noodles. I had ordered a hot tea, vegetable egg roll, and tofu with fresh broccoli and brown rice.

The broccoli was very crunchy, and the tofu was not the normal crispy fried kind but still good. I think I'd like to go back and try some other dishes.

The owner comes over and asks how is everything and makes small talk. -customer service five stars\n\nSoup was great I got the wonton soup to give it a whirl and loved it.  \n\nCrab ragoons, oh the crab ragoons!    I love these things and they have the best in charlotte hands down. \n\nSpring rolls were good, and these things they called shrimp toast were ok.  I didnt know what to expect since I had never heard of shrimp toast but wth right?   Live a little.  I really dont know how to describe them. Soy cake with ground shrimp maybe?   They were a good appetizer and I actually like the flavor but the texture threw me through a loop.   Try em, let me know what you think....\n\nDinner comes right on time.  I dont give a crap what anybody says about food too long too early too whatever. My food, came out perfectly timed and the waiter was on point. \n\nOh dinner...  8 chicken, chicken 8,  something like that with brown rice.  Nom nom nom.   Excellent stuff.  \n\nSo now I sit, on my couch, belly full of really great chinese and all I can say is this, my fortune cookie fortune was lame reslly lame, but the service, food, and atmosphere was freaking Awesome!

Lets be clear here, my girlfriend and I are both college students, Chinese food is our main food of choice. We both decided to go in and dine there yesterday and we regret it fully. We go in and order at the counter and get dine in. Shortly after as we are sitting there in the cheap decor, cheap tables, cheap uncomfortable seats the sever/possible owner brings our food out to us. I got the sesame chicken which looked weird and my girlfriend received the chicken and cashews dish which was made up of 90% mushrooms and the rest being very tiny pieces of chicken. Neither one of us likes mushrooms to any degree but from the image we were shown we would have never know that the dish was made up of that. To continue on as we were sitting there a woman called the place asking where her delivery was. This according to me overhearing the conversation was the 4th time that she has called wondering where her order was because it had been an hour since she placed the order. The women working in the restaurant (possible owner) then began getting angry that she had called again and canceled the order for her and continued on to yell at the customer. This all went down as I was trying to eat my food, I honestly wanted to tell her to shut up. \n\nYes there is more and it gets worse..... The bad looking food, which was brought out on cheap paper plates was HORRIBLE... DISGUSTING... NASTY... etc. There are not enough words in the world to describe how badly it tasted.  The only piece of this experience that I enjoyed was the orange Fanta I got (because it was a standard closed can, it would be hard to screw that up)\n\nI will not return to eat there, I will never order from there, and I advise everyone to refuse to go here for any reason what so ever.

I'm not a Chinese food expert, mainly because I've never visited China, but I could compare it to food I am familiar with, fast food. When I eat at a restaurant, I evaluate it on service, food, and atmosphere. Sing High's disappointed me with their service because the waitress, who seemed to be as old as the eighty-year-old restaurant, accommodated my family with constant refills; however, when my cup finally became vacant, she disappeared into the abyss. Granted it was somewhat busy, since it was 5:00 PM on a Sunday, but I observed she did not tend any other tables. She has waited on my family in the past, which means I should have the luxury of my one complementary refill without having my father go near the kitchen to ask her. However, my experience with their food was phenomenal. I enjoyed my Cantonese Style Chicken Lo Mein, which had a thick, rich gravy mixed in it with medium-sized pieces of chicken. Out of any Chinese dish I've eaten, this was by far the most filling and delicious, not only because of its decent price tag of $7.50, but due to the massive, towering portion. This Lo Mein is tastier than the Chow Mein at Panda Express, and is more satisfying than having any two-entr\u00e9e plate from Panda. \n     The atmosphere was nothing fancy. Even though it doesn't have the crowded feel as a Panda express, it still had an average restaurant feel. The restaurant felt as if it hadn't been updated to a more modern look, mostly because of the faded color plates. I expected more of a Chinese appearance, but the atmosphere, in this case, was not as important as the food. The food was the best feature, and completely dominated the service and atmosphere in my criteria.

Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya. \n\nSo, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.\n\nOh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called \""Salty Fish\"". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home.

The people who touch this grime also handle your food.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of those ingredients has taken a major slide as well.  It seemed that several years ago, those doing the cooking had a sense of pride in their work, which resulted finesse in dishes that's unusual for typical Chinese-American fare.  You could tell subtle differences in preparation from one cook to the next...one would do the egg rolls a little peppery and spicy, the other would do them more vibrant and acidic.

It was spicy, but a flavorful spicy. Not \""OMG, get me water NOW!\"" spicy, but just enough that you felt it. \n\nBetween the two of us, we seemed to favor the black pepper chicken over the kung pao. Both made a very delicious lunch the next day for both of us.\n\nAt the end of our meal we were given the traditional fortune cookie as well as what I would describe as a bit of banana in a wonton with honey drizzled on it. That was a pleasant and delicious surprise.\n\nService was good, as usual with this place.

This newly opened George & Son Chinese & Asian Cuisine Restaurant is next to the AMC Deer Valley movie theater, and they already have another restaurant by the same name in Scottsdale (same recipes).  I came here for lunch and tried their Mongolian Beef ($7.95) and Shrimp with Walnuts (Honey Walnut Shrimp) ($8.95) lunch platters.  It comes with salad, crab puff, vegetable roll, lo mein and steam rice.  Although their salad tasted warm (should be served colder), everything else tasted great with flavors that jumps out at you!  Beef was tender with lots of flavors from the sauce and scallions, and honey walnut shrimp was breaded well with yummy sauce and fresh walnuts.  Good portion size too.  They have typical Chinese dishes such as Egg Foo Young, Fried Rice (6 varieties), Moo Shu Pork, Ma Po Tofu, but also items such as Hong Kong Style Ribs, Pad Thai, and Salt & Pepper Shrimp.  Hosts and waitresses are all very friendly (even seems over friendly), and asks for your feedback on their food.  It looks like they have a full bar, modern decor, and clean.  If everyone is giving Shangri-La 4 stars, then this place truly deserves 6 stars!  However I know good Chinese food, so I am giving this place 4.5 stars for being the best Chinese restaurant I know in AZ.  I would highly recommend going here for lunch and try their lunch combinations, but dinner too ($10+/dish) if you have people to share dishes with.

I thought it might be in the process of closing, but they weren't. After perusing the menu, I ordered the lemon chicken, same as Taric. After placing my order to go, I chatted up the owner about how long the restaurant had been there, how business was, etc. She was incredibly warm and friendly, and after hearing about how the economy had recently took a toll on their profits, I suggested that if the food was to my liking, I would stop in for return business.\n\nIn short, I'm grateful that I didn't read Taric's review beforehand, otherwise I may have been disinclined to visit. The lemon chicken that I had was fantastic. It wasn't at all overcooked, had a great flavor, and was served on a bed of delicious fried rice. Since my order was takeout, the lemon sauce was on the side. Expecting it to be super sweet and syrupy (as Taric suggested it was), I poured just a light drizzle on my chicken, and I found it to be just the right flavor, so I added more.\n\nAs for the accoutrements, not only did my meal come with a wonton and a hefty eggroll, it also came with a fried shrimp. The combination meal that I ordered was considered the smaller portion, and it was filling. My out the door total was less than nine bucks, so I have no idea how anyone could call this food overpriced.\n\nAll in all, I had an excellent meal (that totally hit the spot after 90 minutes of hot yoga) for a reasonable price at a local business that I will be more than happy to continue to give my business to.

This weekend they did a \""remodel\"".  I believe they upgraded their POS (Point of Sale) system.  They also no longer accept coupons.  For $26.18 + tip, we would get a decent amount of food.  This included 3 entrees in a good size box with egg fried rice, steamed rice, and lo mein. along with egg flower soup, and free crab puffs (coupon).  All orders included packets of soy sauce, hot mustard, and a cup of sweet and sour.  When I order tonight, we ordered the same things we always did.  The portions are half the size, egg flower soup looks nothing like what used to be (basically broth and egg), nor do the crab puffs (processed coating).  We were now charged over $30 for a dinner for a dinner that I didn't touch and, even if I ate, couldn't feed my family.  I hope other regulars post their comments.  Do not order from here until they change back.  I now wish I took pictures of food I previously ordered, so I could post what I just got in comparison.  I will complain in person, but will be finding some place different to get my Chinese food.  To my delivery driver, I am sorry, Henry.\n\nMy thoughts are that Larry Y's comment are because he is the new owner or some how affiliated with this new restaurant.

In an effort to enjoy all that the city has to offer, I found myself here at Chang's one recent weekend afternoon, with the hope of scoring something delicious. What I had found was what I expected all along: an average run of the mill \""yum cha\"" experience.\n\nIt's not entirely their fault, after all Las Vegas isn't overrun with a Chinatown that isn't filled with seedy adult joints and gringofied Chinese spots without the support or demand of a larger community. Hence, the exterior gives away the experience ahead of time: a semi-cheesy palatial looking front coupled with a retro sign that screams Chinese Americana from decades before.\n\nInside the Dim Sum scene is within the typical banquet hall, with a few carts that make their rounds, usually a couple with steamed dishes and the others with more fried pastries and desserts. Once we saw the same 4 carts that approached the table and very few staffers with special dishes to give out, the experience and variety is going to be limited.\n\nEverything from the steamed to the fried was bland. My beloved shrimp dumplings (har gow) needed some serious hot sauce before I could rip them from their mini bamboo baskets, even when the rice shell is dry and falling apart. The same could be applied to the fried pork dumplings (ham sui gok), which all of its glutinous glory was puffy and thick, but unfortunately was lacking on the pork part, skimpified on the guts side. All of the rice noodle wraps / crepes (cheurng fun) all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption, though the same can be said about the lo mai gai, siu mai, and fish + meat ball (ngau yuk yuen / lang yu kau).\n\nA surprisingly decent dish? The stir fried rice noodle with sesame seed. Soaked in soy sauce, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seed and peppers, it was surprisingly flavorful and light. It was fragrant and the texture was silky smooth. It piques my curiosity for their other non-cart noodle dishes. To no one's surprise, it falls in the special price column on the Dim Sum receipt.",0.0,0.9872099161148072

I am a fan of the Chinese restaurant lunch specials. They are one of the best deals in town. I didn't do my homework, and after burning fuel driving around, I wanted to grab lunch and get on with exploring Charlie Frias Park. I checked-in at the Panda.\n\n  These days my opinion of the Panda has changed. The average $9 plus tax transaction for a two item combo and medium beverage trails behind the pricing of genuine Chinese restaurants. Especially at lunch. \n\n  In my book, Panda Express is a good choice when it is in a large place with a captive audience or when the area lacks good Chinese restaurants. This location is an example. It is in a location where a transient stretch of Tropicana merges into Las Vegas communities. The majority of restaurants are fast food eateries in the shadow of the Orleans. When I dine here it is more out of convenience than hunger. In my situation it was near Charlie Frias Park, a quick yet creepy walk.\n\n  This Panda has a large footprint. I cannot see a problem with ever getting a table. \n\n  The chicken with mushrooms, fried rice (they also have brown), and chow mein was fast food good.  Where Panda outbeats local Chinese restaurant lunch specials is in their chow mein. At the local restaurants I often leave over the chow mein noodles where in Panda, the chow mein noodles on my plate turns to air. Problem! Chicken with mushrooms was not my food of choice. This location suffered from what I call the Panda Syndrom. This is a major flaw when the food trays are empty causing a presentation of metal and cooking oils (to put it kindly). This looks bad. They would be doing the customer a favor by putting a cover over the empty food trays. Possibly showing a panda with a frown saying \""Sorry we will be cooking new food.\""\n\n  When there is a good Chinese restaurant nearby and I am unrushed I will probably pass over Panda.

The main issue as re-iterated over and over again by many reviewers is the price.  I know its Vegas, and on the casino floor, but some of the pricing is just eye watering; moreso considering its not fantastic by any means. (Sidenote, Pin Pang Pong at the Gold Coast, Zine at Palazzo and the Venetian Hong Kong Noodle restaurant all manage reasonable Chinese food at decent prices on/close to the strip, it is possible!)\n\nI should clarify that its not bad, not bad at all.  If you're looking for something crazy authentic, or top notch, then this isn't for you.  Indeed the strip probably isn't the best place at all.  After a loooong day of wandering around, several beers and frosty frozen beverages, gambling away and what not, we randomly ended up in Dragon Noodle out of simple necessity to refuel and take a breather.\n\nWe tried a few egg rolls, both vegi and non vegi, a fried rice dish, a seafood noodle dish, a beer and a cocktail.  I think all said and done it came to around $90 with tax and tip, which just *felt* like too much for a relatively simple and basic selection. Service was fast and efficient, but not particularly friendly, and the atmosphere wasn't anything to write home about.\n\nIf they were to drop the pricing and told their staff to cheer up, they could easily up themselves to a three star.",0.0,0.9951711297035216

I came in with a group of friends (we have all been here numerous times prior and just can't seem to stay away).  Here's the scoop:\n\nOrdered:\n Pot Stickers (8)  $6.95\n Spicy Salt Squid $8.25\n Baked Pork Chop w/ Spicy Salt $8.25\n Sweet & Sour Chicken $8.25\n House Special Crispy Noodle $6.95\n Shrimp Fried Rice $7.50\n Ice water\n\nPros:  \n* Service is extremely fast (even when it's busy) & accurate w/ the order.\n* Generous portions and decently priced\n* Awesome Chinese food... I love it!\n\nCons:\n* My favorite dishes (see below) are missing from the Lunch Specials\n* There's a \""house special\"" board in the restaurant, but I can't read it because it is written in Mandarin (or perhaps Cantonese...I'm not sure exactly which it is).\n\nTips:\n* We didn't order it this time, but definitely try the Baked Pork Chops with Chef Sauce... It is to die for!  A perfect combo of sweetness and crunch that I can't get enough of.\n\n* Lunch Specials run from 11 am- 3 pm and only comes Steam Rice\n\n* This place is a little hard to find, but look for Sonny's Saloon.  Diamond Chinese is connected.\n\n* ask for their hot sauce.. mmmmmmm\n\n*  Yes they cater!\n\nFinal Verdict:\n  This place is a must!  I'm a big fan of Chinese cuisine, but this place just stands out to me.  I haven't had a dish that I  didn't like from Diamond (not to mention the food is not overly oily like most of its' competitors).  My favorites and \""must haves\"" include: the Houes Special Crispy Noodle (AMAZING!!!!), Baked Pork Chops w/ Chef Sauce (this sauce makes this dish!), and the Spicy Salt Squid.  Aside from the food, the service here is amazing as well.  The server always recognizes me (even if I have not gone in for months).  She always remembers that I'm a big fan of their hot sauce (which appears to be a homemade concoction of sorts mainly composed of Sriracha) and that I like to have hot tea.  Upon taking my order, she already has both in hand.  It's always nice when places remember their customers.  What can I say... I'm a fan!!",1.0,0.9990262985229492

I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but you know, at least decent food. This was not decent. The family and I got: calamari, Singaporean street noodles, Buddha's Feast, and the Chino-Latino Pineapple pork. The calamari was alright, bland and wasn't crispy. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the calamari at all. It almost overpowered it. The Singaporean noodles had potential, but it was wayy too salty. I ordered the Buddha's Feast, expecting it to be like a Buddha's delight sort of thing: veggies with brown sauce. What I got: steamed vegetables with some pieces of tofu. NO SAUCE. Like, wtf? I wouldn't have gotten that if I knew I was only getting steamed vegetables. I just doused it with some soy sauce because I needed some kind of flavor. The Chino-Latino pineapple pork wasn't bad at all actually. It the pork was a bit crisp, and the pineapple salsa ish topping was good. Also, my sister ordered this coconut refresher (can't remember the exact name) and it was just like coconut milk out of the can with a shitton of sugar. Not good.\n\nWith the quality of the food being not good, the price they charge is not worth it. At all. You're pretty much paying for the ~ambiance~.

Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant. \n\nThe Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but  fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu. \n\nAs for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional. \n\nAs a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties). \n \nTake out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website. \n\nHere is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available. \n\nhttp://goldenphoenixrestaurant.com/",1.0,0.9933524131774902

Cashew Chickn and Kung Pao Chicken ($8.25) are both good dishes, but lacking in the sauce flavor department. Both dishes had plenty of veggies, chicken, and nuts, but were fairly bland overall. Hot & Sour soup is one of the best I've ever had, and they include plenty of medium sized shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, etc. I've had better tasting and better quality food elsewhere, but the difference is absolutely marginal.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great place to go for a good ol' fashioned Chinese/American meal with your family or friends.

Several months ago, I dined at the buffet--truly the best buffet I have ever experienced. This time, I decided to try Jasmine, a much touted and pricey Chinese restaurant.    Now, as most of you know, Chinese food--even delicious Chinese food--is typically quite inexpensive. That's why I was curious to see if there was anything different or tres gourmet about Jasmine to justify it's acclaim AND its price tag. To my disappointment, I found little justification.

But let me right off the bat say that the food here is actually of a pretty good quality.  It is true that you will pay a slightly higher price for the food given that it is in the upscale Wynn hotel, but then again, if you really crave good, authentic asian food while on the strip and do not have the time to drive out to Chinatown, then Red 8 is probably a good place to settle, because it does have decent food.  So I've giving it a solid three stars becuase it is nothing spectacular, but when you just want a simple Asian meal in a nice setting, then Red 8 is the place to go.  Head to Wing Lei if you want an upscale experience with phenomenal quality Chinese food. \n\nThe setting is pretty casual and you can come in dressed as you are, although I have seen some people dining here who are dressed pretty nicely.  Order their noodle dishes - get it from the section of the menu which offers noodle dishes from the Wynn Macau.

Not bad for the Wynn, I think. \n\nI've eaten here a few times and the last time I was here I got the Mapo Tofu.  It was delicious.  The sauce was not too starchy (which can happen when too much corn starch is used) and the pork was pretty lean, yet still added flavor to the dish. As an aside, the debate over mapo tofu is usually whether to use lean or fatty pork.

Don't get me wrong, I understand why people would not like this place.  It is an overpriced, fusion asian place in a casino.  Since casinos expect all their venues to make money including the comps they give to big players, this has resulted in menu prices to go through the roof.  Of course, there is increasing food prices in general, but it does not explain the situation alone.\n\nSo, when I dine at a casino restaurant, my expectations are a bit lower.  As I tell everyone who will listen, eat anywhere but a casino.  I end up doing so because the people I am with are too lazy or do not think that they are missing out on anything.  Anyway, on to review.\n\nAmbience and service are very good.  Our server did speak in heavily accented English, so he was a bit hard to understand.  It does not bother me, but I realize some people are annoyed by this.\n\nFor the food, I think it is a fair parallel to PF Chang's.  If you hate PF Chang's because it isn't real Chinese, then you will hate this place.  This place is for tourist from all over the place and often places that only have a PF Chang's representing Asian food.\n\nI think that given that you are in a overpriced casino restaurant, the prices are decent.  It is a bit less than the Wynn's Chinese restaurants.  At least the bowl of Hot and Sour soup is $6 and not $9 or whatever it was.  Most of the entrees ran about $15 on average for your typical noodles, Mongolian beef and such.  The portions are not outrageously tiny like the Wynn, but they are not terribly big either.  If you have a ton of heavy eaters, you had better make your way to the buffet instead.\n\nAt least I got my rice fix and I was not charged extra for it  (a very common sin in casino Chinese restaurants).\n\nIf you want decent Chinese food, jump in a cab and go to:\n\nHarbor Seafood Palace\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/harbor-palace-seafood-restaurant-las-vegas",0.0,0.9841892123222352

Each slice was half a mouthful lol...\n\nBBQ Pork & Duck Noodle Soup 2/5: Barely any duck, and a few slices of bbq pork, the presentation was great, but honestly not worth it.\n\nFu Chow Fried Rice 3/5: presentation, taste, and portion was bang on! lots of shrimp, chicken, mushroom, calamari, and scallion gravy...worth it!!\n\nOverall the quality of the dishes were below my expectations.

This coffee shop, located adjacent to the Palms' convenient self parking garage, used to be inexpensive and reasonably decent.  Now the food is inedible and the prices eye-popping.  There are American and Asian menus.  The American menu features $10 burgers, $12 BLT sandwiches, and late at night a $7 ham steak and eggs (toast is extra).  Soft drinks are $4 and a cup of hot water with a tea bag will set you back $5 -- unless you order from the Asian menu where hot tea is $1 per person.  We wound up ordering from the less-expensive Asian menu.  One of us had $9 kung pao chicken which was OK, but rice is now $1, and the free crispy noodles with duck sauce and mustard that used to arrive automatically is no more.  I ordered the $9 beef chow fun with gravy.  It almost arrived with the kung pao, but the waitress said, oops, we forgot the gravy so I sat there for 15 minutes or so watching my SO eat her kung pao while they redid the chow fun.  The beef chow fun with gravy turned out to be no fun, the \""gravy\"" was some tasteless brown substance that was so greasy the chow fun noodles slid off the fork every time I tried to eat them.  The beef was likewise bland and inedible.  A bottle of soy sauce was served with brown crud caked onto the side of the bottle.  \""It's only dried soy sauce,\"" she explained.\n\nThere is just no comparison to, say, the excellent and reasonably priced Chinese and American fare a few miles down the Strip at the South Point.

Again, really good.\n\nMy second night there I had the Cantonese sausage fried rice and lamb tenderloin (more along the lines of what I would usually order) and it was very flavorful.

I've been jaded when it comes to Chinese food since I came to Arizona. I used this line before in my review for George and Son's in Scottsdale, but Arizona feels like the land that Chinese food forgot. Every single place out here that I have tried (other than PF Changs) uses low quality meat, large amounts of MSG, and overall is disappointing in every aspect. This is why I go to PF Changs.\n\nI come from Philadelphia, which has a pretty large Chinatown. When I first learned of the Chinese situation here, a tear rolled down my cheek. Chinese food is a staple to my existence (as someone who is Jewish, my Christmas's would be lost without it!).

The portions are very tiny, the prices are high, and I hate the commercialization. \n\nMy personal recommendation is to get the Chicken Chow Fun. For the price, this is the largest thing on the menu. This is a dish of wide egg noodles with large white meat cuts of chicken.\n\nHere is a picture for reference (though this is Beef Chow Fun):\n\nhttp://jadecafe2565.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Beef_Chow_Ho_Fun-3.29102408_std.JPG\n\nSometimes this comes with the noodles undercooked. Sometimes this comes drowning in sauce. Though most of the time it comes just right.  I grew to love this dish after my time over there. It is a staple street food that I could get for 5 RMB at the most (around 70 cents).

P. F. Chang's somehow built a reputation, albeit hardly deserved, of offering high quality \""gourmet\"" Chinese food.  So, naturally, I decided that I wanted to try P. F. Chang's.\n\nOne evening before I graduated, the team decided to celebrate our impending freedom from Michael Crow's tuitionary grasp by dining at the P.F. Chang's across the street.  I don't recall what I had, but I think it was a Singapore Chow Fun (or something to that effect).  It was...passable I guess, but it cost $15, and wasn't even close to being as good as the Singapore Chow Fun I've had at Chinese take-out places in New York, and it cost over twice as much.  This poor college student could tell right off hand that this place is incredibly overrated (its average 3-star review is still too generous).\n\nFast forward a few weeks, and I'm in Houston for a job training regime.  The group decides to hit up P.F. Chang's for dinner.  I figured, since the company is reimbursing, I might as well give it another shot.  The appetizers were the best part of my meal, and the rest... well, it was the same drab, flavorless ennui we have all grown to expect from this place.\n\nThen, of course, there was our lunch last week (once again, I didn't pay.  P.F. Chang's now occupies an important spot on my list of places I would never pay to eat at).  I had the honey garlic chicken, which didn't taste honey, garlic, or anything else besides deep fried chunks of chicken dipped in a lame sweet and sour type sauce.  I only ate half of it, which is worth mentioning, if you knew me at all.\n\nAnd don't get me started on those lettuce wraps.  Those are the most overrated dish in the history of corporate faux-ethnic cuisine.\n\nThe only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because their less expensive offering, Pei Wei, manages to be EVEN WORSE!  I swear, Pei Wei has only one sauce, whether you buy the Thai or General Tso's.  Do yourself a favor and just stick with your local neighborhood Chinese take-out place.

The nice thing is that they have pictures of almost all their dishes plastered up on the wall if we wanted some visual idea of what we were to order and there's Chinese on their menu too. The owner also speaks both Cantonese and Mandarin. Unfortunately, when we went on a Friday night, the place was horribly understaffed with only one cook (most likely the owner) and one waiter.

At least we had tea to keep our stomachs from growling too loudly.\n\nOnce the food arrived, I guess I expected more authentic Chinese cooking. The beef and chicken was steamed and looked like one of the healthy options you would choose off a separate menu. They had a nice variety of Chinese styled vegetables though and a very wide Asian drink selection. My regret is that I should have looked at some of the pictures before ordering because some of the dishes were surprisingly simple. Such as the shrimp & eggs for $10, which was literally a couple of shrimps put inside an egg omelet. I'm not quite sure how authentic that is...\n\nThe decor was simple. There were just a couple of tables for sit-down eating and only two tables that could accommodate large parties of either 6 or 8. It is also BYOB which I didn't discover until another party brought in a couple bottles of wine.

Spare ribs wasn't bad either, definitely had the black bean flavored infused in the meat.  Note that you're going to have to do a lot of sucking/ripping off the meat from the bones (something I'm not fond of doing, but that's what you do with spare ribs!)  I liked the pork/tofu dish!  The brown sauce was a bit thick and very flavorful.  The sauce is perfect for the tofu because the tofu just absorbs whatever sauce it's sitting in.\n\nI thought it was funny that there are actually two separate menus.

It didn't contain the usual mix of chinese mushrooms that you would normally find along with that dark brown chili broth that I live for.\n\nThe fried rice was dry as a bone and the expensive 10.95 pu-pu platter was a few pieces of dry overcooked pork, 1 ghetto chicken wing that we were afraid to eat and these measly little dried shrimps. \n\nThe egg rolls were dry, tasteless and inedible.\n\nI ordered the orange chicken and I seriously think that they pre-ordered this stuff from some ready- made food company and microwaved it because it started to make me nauseous. \n\nAnd now the dumplings.....It says we were suppose to get 8 and the pictures looked good..what we got was 6 shriveled little things and I don't even want to venture with whats inside. \n\nI am from New York and have had my share of bad and good Chinese and I know I will not get the quality of good NYC Chinese food in Phoenix but this is just bad, overpriced food, with a nasty receptionist and I will NEVER eat here again!!\n\nPass the Maalox please!!!",0.0,0.9996128678321838

First off, I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on that - which dominates a lot of their menu items.  But here's what we did have\n\nMongolian Beef - This was the only good dish I sampled. However, this is NOT mongolian beef. They're like mini steaks. It tasted good, like duck actually, and it was very tender. However, it was nowhere near Mongolian beef. I did like the sauce that came with it since it was infused with a slight hint of habanero. But this was not Mongolian beef in the slightest.\n\n\""Chow fun\"" (Beef rice noodle with soy sauce) - they weren't kidding. It was just that. No other real flavorings, just soy sauce. No attempt at making a delicious sauce. Just take some kikoman or something and pour it over noodles, fry it for 5 seconds and serve. Wow. bad.\n\nCombination Fried Rice - What the hell is with all these beans? There was like no meat in my dish. Who does this? Really????\n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - My cousin's favorite dish. He enjoyed it. I enjoyed the walnut.\n\nAdditionally - no free refills on soda. I mean, I'd expect that at a Pho restaurant, but not a crappy expensive Chinese restaurant. (I guess it's not really Chinese, but \""Asian Fusion\"" - Asian fused with crap)\n\nFor those that enjoy Chinese food, you know it's about the large, family-sized portions. I didn't expect much of that here, but for the price they make you pay, they surely don't delivery in either quality or quantity.\n\nOverall this place sucks, and it left such a bad memory in my head, that I went to Panda Express the morning after and had a much more satisfying meal for less.

DO NOT!\n\nThis review is specifically for the Chinese Fast Food in the front of the store which is set-up similar to Panda Express.  We like the store itself.\n\nDO NOT!\n\nWe wanted something quick and easy for dinner and made the mistake of giving this a shot.  In case you didn't pick up on my previous admonitions, DO NOT eat here.  \n\nWe took our food home, tasted it, picked at it, I actually ate some and regretted it still this morning.  The rice was dry, the cubed veggies in the rice were re-dehydrated.  The spicy chicken was spicy, oily and stale.  Overall the freshness and quality was poor, especially the freshness.  DO NOT!\n\nAgain, the store and staff in the store are friendly and the manager cheerfully refunded our money this morning so for the store, DO and for the Chinese prepared food, DO NOT.\n\nIn closing I would like to sum-up with the following: I don't recommended the Chinese food here.

But pay attention to the \""Asian\"" in the title; these are not Chinese people and they do dishes other than the expected standards. Also, this is not the place for your romantic once-in-a-lifetime gastronomic adventure; it's a place that gives you consistently good, well prepared, food, on a regular basis.\n\nThe folks in there are from Burma (brother, sister, husband thereof); they make food that seems to be from all over. Since this is the U.S., most of the menu is standard Chinese-American, but check out the dishes listed on the right-hand side of the menu. There's a real range. In particular the curried dishes are invariably yummy.\n\nOrdering by phone is the right thing to do. Sonny would always tell me (it seemed) that your order will be ready in \""40 minutes\"". For a while I was puzzled by this, especially since the food never seemed to be ready at the promised time. Eventually I figured out that they wait for you to show up and then make your meal  and so you end up with fresh made dishes. We're regular customers, so this works out. You probably have to go there a number of times before they start to recognize you on the phone.\n\nI'm a bit puzzled by some of the other reviews: you're not going to get something just like what you got in some particular West Coast eatery; eating out is about variety, and being open to different approaches. In any case, if you want to be picky, in my experience none of the stuff in this country is anything like what you get in mainland China (where the cuisine is just totally way better).\n\nAmong the things that I like about this place is that they cook everything to order (I can't believe someone compared Zaw's to the vendor at CMU that serves almost everything from a steam table; yuk). Certain dishes stand out: I hate to use this one as the example, but their General T'so chicken is (I think) the best I've had in the city. Many other places treat this as a \""chicken-flavored fried dough\"" dish. Zaw's does it right: the batter is very thin and the chicken is all white. It tastes as a chicken dish; who cares if there's a bit too much sauce? Yes, I know that T'so's is not \""real\"" Chinese, but I believe that Zaw's preparation of it tells you what you need to know about their general approach.\n\nI should point out that there's also some real losers on the menu.

The noodles weren't the authentic thick and round kind, and the taste was a far cry from what I'm accustomed to.  Gross. \n \n* Xiaolong bao: the XLB were decent but you could detect the thawed taste in the meat filling--obviously frozen, not fresh.\n\n* Fish fillets in wine and vinegar sauce: mediocre dish, but the wine and vinegar ratio was very imbalanced.  It was more vinegary than drunken.\n\n* Wheat gluten (mian jin) and mushroom dish for our veggie friend: the mian jin was funky--way too spongy and slimy inside.\n\nWhat finally broke the camel's back for us was the service.

As for me, I remember seeing the noodle shop, and having some hot noodle soup or chow mein sounded yummy after drinking all weekend. So, our group headed over to the noodle shop.\n\nFirst off, the service is really really bad here. The service is slow, and half of the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Granted you don't get good service in a Chinese place, it was still worse than many other places. Our waiter just didn't care about anything, and never came back to ask how our food was or refill our water. On top of that, we wanted to split the bill at the end. So the way we usually do that, is write each person's last 4 digits of their credit card number and the amount they want to have charged on their card. At every restaurant, waiter's are please to see us make it so easy for them, and have it done right away. However, the staff here just couldn't figure it out. We waited a total of 20 minutes just to get our bill back. I noticed that there was about 4 people trying to handle the bill, and none of them could get it, so they finally had the manager come out. After the whopping 20 minutes, we finally got our bill back.\n\nAs for the food here, let's just say I much rather go to Panda Express for my Chinese food. I ordered chow mein, and it was soo bland and soo oily and greasy. I can't cook Chinese food for shit, and I could whip something better up.\n\nOverall, I was really disspointed since I was craving some good , or even settle for decent, Chinese food.

Good idea not to use msg but my shrimp dish should not have chicken in it because I didn't order a combo dish.  I also found chunks of whole garlic which I had to spit out.  Traditionally, shrimp with lobster sauce does not have ginger as a flavoring.  Lots of ginger which in most chinese dishes is great but not lobster sauce. My partner had orange chicken which consisted of large pieces chicken on a bed of duck sauce.  Did not see any evidence that orange peels were used as is traditional in this dish.  My partner thought the chicken had too much crust.  I tasted it and thought the  crust was fine.  Ordered pork potstickers (dumplings) and the dumpling dipping sauce was vinegary.

Yes, you read right ... I'm not having a stroke:  this is REAL Chinese food as it's meant to be and not the slop most Americans think is Chinese food.  The restaurant has its flaws:  the young girl playing waitress is inefficient, sullen and spends more time listening to music than taking care of guests.  But she's a kid; where's the surprise.  The place is run by a husband / wife team and they are usually overwhelmed and can't handle the customers efficiently.  Sometimes, dad goes a bit overboard with the oil in the wok and customers need to open the door to the restaurant to let the smoke out.  And you might be waiting a while for dinner  (bring a book).  Oh and they don't take credit cards.  So, you might ask:  why the positive attitude?  Because all of that is outweighed by huge portions of real and tasty Chinese food as your imperialistic, colonizing  great grandparents had, when they forced westernization on China at the end of a gunship.  The Chinese eventually got back at us by ensuring that any and all emigrants to the U.S. couldn't cook to save their lives.  Somehow, they forgot to brainwash this couple.  \n\nTry the eggrolls, hot and sour soup and duck for an idea of what these dishes are supposed to taste like!  Be very careful of ordering portions like you're used to at other places:  they really do serve huge amounts for little money.  Your stomach will be happy; your wallet will do the Happy Dance.  \n\nSome reviewers have said, that the restaurant plays loose and easy with their hours and this is true.  They're supposed to be open till 8pm  (ahh, the joys of late night dining in a \""major\"" city); but sometimes they'll stay open later ... sometimes not.  Be flexible!  I know, it's frustrating; but the food is worth it.  Come here and you'll never eat Chop Suey or Fried Rice ever again!\n\nClosed on Thursdays?  OK ... that's strange, I know.

Dumplings come either steamed or fried and the ponzu sauce with it tasted home made and was simply amazing. The pepper steak was fantastic, the best I've ever had. They were out of green onions so zucchini and mushrooms were added instead, it was still fabulous. Hot and sour soup was some of the best I've ever had - crispy noodles that came with it were slightly stale (tasted weird) and so took off a star for that. \n\nThis meal was otherwise perfect and I will definitely be ordering here again.

No egg--just a mound of sticky brown rice clearly created by adding soy sauce to overcooked clumped white rice.  Wow, what culinary prowess.  I can't tell you how bad the rice was.  None of it was eaten. The egg roll was fine.  Probably purchased frozen so all they had to do was fry it.  No wonder it was good.  \nHubby had chicken with broccoli and it was mediocre at best.  The same egg fried rice in one, brown mound of clump.  None of it was eaten.\nI felt it was my duty to tell them that the rice was terrible.  They have to try to fix it right??

We did not want to be late... I wanted to go to KJ's for some authentic chinese food and we ended up coming here as the event was starting and located in Summerlin.\n\nHere we go...\n\na.  The Good - Ok, if you are not used to eating the real authentic chinese food, then you will like this place. It is like an upscale Panda Express with healthy foods choices and a really nice and inviting eat in environment.\n\n- Choices - I like that they have a lot of spicy choices, and you can order many of the items on the list with Chicken, Pork, Beef, or Tofu.\n\n- Brown Rice - Awesome that they have brown rice and this also adds to the healthy \n\n- Fresh - Everything seems so fresh.  We Had:\n\n- Honey Seared Chicken with Brown Rice\n- Thai Wonton Sooup\n- Thai Dynamite Chicken\n- Spicy Korean Chicken\n\nb.  The Really Good - Their drink and condiment section is totally cool. I don't know why I liked this so much, but it is clean, they have a great deal of choices for drinks, some teas, plenty of cut lemon and orange slices, Fortune Cookies, chili sauce and hot chinese mustard!  Oddly, I did not look for, and I don't remember if they have soy sauce, and this would actually get a way from the healthy aspect of the food.\n\nc.  The Ambiance - As I said, upscale atmosphere for extremely casual people. You really feel that you are in a well taken care of and top notch cafe.\n\nd.  The Bad - The only bad I found was that everything was a bit bland.  The Thai Wonton Soup was not very Thai style to me. The taste was a bit off and uninspiring.  The Spicy Korean Chicken had a heavy sauce that created all the taste and the chicken itself did not have any of the flavor. Kind of like dipping chicken in kitchen.  The sauce was the overpowering flavor and that is not great to me at all.\n\ne.  Comeback - I will come back to give this place a second chance. While it is not what I consider really authentic, I will also challenge the healthiness of the food here as even though there is brown rice and some really great looking stuff, it seems that everything is 800-1200 calories and there are so many other better choices for quality food for the same caloric intake. \n\nGK says, not bad, and as long as you know this is totally just an asian influenced cuisine and not really authentic, then you will be very happy.\n\nI give it a 3 star because of the blandness and the overpowering sauces and under performing soup...",1.0,0.9771583080291748

That's definitely expensive for Chinese.  But I don't think you can argue that food here is bad.  \n\nBasically what you're paying for is the service and decor.

That said...this stuff tasted exactly like the Chinese food I get in Monterery Park.  And in fact, the mongolian beef actually tasted almost exactly like Panda Express' Beijing Beef.

There was a slight change in staffing, one that I'm not particularly fond of.\n\nAfter being to several fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas and other parts of the countries, I've noticed that it's quite difficult to find a ridiculously stunning Chinese restaurant.  For example, there's a reason why you don't find French fast-food.  It's just not built that way.\n\nAnyways, me and a client of mine went to Wing Lei with reservations, and we ordered the carpaccio and the potstickers for appetizers.  They were fine- they tasted fine and not as bold in flavor as other Chinese restaurants, so I don't think they were worth the money that you pay for.\n\nAs far as the main course goes, they were pretty good- even though the menu items are similar (if not the same) to other items you see at regular Chinese restaurants, you can tell the difference in taste.  Where the appetizers lack, the main course dishes compensate in terms of the strength in flavor.\n\nIf you went to a Chinese restaurant off the strip with chefs who DIDN'T go to cooking school and learned recipes straight from the mainland, you'll notice a difference in taste because when a dish is spicy, it's SPICY, or when it's sweet, you taste the sugar.  At Wing Lei, it's a little toned down because it's catered to tourist, but you can still notice the small distinctions of the dishes, like the sauce used in their General Tsao chicken and shiitake mushrooms used in their braised tofu dish.\n\nI think that if you wanted a fancy Chinese restaurant with all the decor and all the service- this is certainly the place to take a date on.  This is NOT the place to take a large family with children.  As far as food goes, you can find other Chinese restaurants off-strip, or Pan-Asian cuisine that is loads better than Wing Lei.",0.0,0.9883614182472228

Where is the rest of the duck I just paid $80 for?  \""It's being made into duck shu mai\"" the waitress said.\n\nWell -- they brought the shu mai out, and I highly DOUBT it was made with the duck we just ate. Very small pieces of duck in the shu mai, that tasted pre-made, overly salty and not very good. And there was practically a WHOLE peking duck leftover that they took away. Where is the rest of that glorious, glorious duck?? A lady at the table next to us was now chewing a Peking duck leg. I'm pretty sure that's where our duck went. SHADY!!!  \n\n(If you order duck at this place, I suggest asking that you just eat the duck as is with the bread, onions and hoisin sauce, and DON'T get the shu mai. See if they'll let you keep the whole duck! We should have asked for this!)\n\nSo we felt pretty screwed. I mean the $20 for white rice was the nail in the coffin. We could have gotten a fried rice dish at least for less than that.

But as they started to carve the duck our outlook changed greatly. They didn't separate the skin from the meat, leaving all the fat trapped in between. They then cut four pieces to be divided between two pancakes each, only to wheel away the remainder of the bird. We watched in horror as it went back into the kitchen. The duck itself was fatty and flavorless, the pancakes fell apart before you could get them into your mouth. \n\nThe next course was duck salad, which while beautifully packaged was boring to taste and lacked flavor. It was wrapped in a wonton casing which while you could eat, but was also 100% flavorless. The third course was duck wonton soup - it had a great smoky flavor to the broth, but lacked any real duck meat. Finally, the last two courses, duck chow mein and wok fried duck were also flavorless which seemed to be the theme for the evening.\n\nThe food felt as if it was \""dumbed down\"" for a boring American audience.

So does spending $34 for an order of orange beef or walnut prawns make it better than your favorite dive?\n\nThe food.  The walnut prawns were outstanding.  Fresh, sweet, perfectly cooked with the right balance of crispy coating and not overly sweet honey cream sauce (it's not mayo).   The orange beef is well cooked, tender.  It is dressed in a tangerine, yuzu, and garlic chili sauce that adds a nice acidic balance but lacks the flavor punch you expect.

This review is clearly long overdue, but here's my two cents anyway.\n\nFirst, the decor is absolutely gorgeous. With red, gold, and black accents, the ambience is very elegant and luxurious. One of the things I remember most about our dinner was not the food, but the beautiful chairs they had at every table. There were some tables that had booth seats on one side, against the wall, and those were just as opulent.\n\nAt the time, my parents didn't want to go over the $150, so there were only so many things we could order. As I'm Taiwanese, I don't see a reason to spend more than $20 (heck, even $10) on one Chinese dish. Majority of the plates here are at least $30, going as high as $90. I'm glad I'm fortunate enough to live in an area where authentic Chinese & Taiwanese food is readily available for less than $10. Anyway, between the four of us, I believe we shared 3-4 plates. Since this was awhile back, I don't remember exactly what we ordered; just that it was surprisingly tasty.\n\nI would love to come back again for dinner, even though I don't remember the specifics. Considering that Asian fusion restaurants seem to cater to non-Asians more -- I'm looking at you P.F. Chang's -- I'm just happy that I didn't find the food repulsive.

The food comes out one dish at a time. We ordered house fried rice. Which turned out to be shaved cured pork belly, not bacon mind you..think salty pork, green onion and rice with an overwhelming flavor of fish sauce. It was also quite oily. Our second dish of pork spare ribs in sweet and sour sauce comes. The flavor is good but there is very little meat and mostly bone in bite sized pieces. It's not cool to be fishing in your mouth for bones especially when you feel like your being observed by patrons and staff alike. The third dish of smoked duck comes, clearly it is liquid smoke, not true smoked meat. Nothing good about this meal. I am not a rude person so we asked our server to box the leftovers so as not to insult them. I told her she could just put it in one box. I believe this offended her as she was adamant that they be put in separate boxes...ok, we walked out of there and immediately threw it in the trash which was our intent from the beginning. Hence the one box. Don't go here...fair warning. Hard lesson learned. I will be eating on the strip for my Chinese food fix from now on.

I've heard that the Orange Chicken is awesome, I'm not a big fan of this dish so I've never had it here, but at some stage I'll see if I can convince the wife to get some then try a small bit to see what the fuss is about. The only thing keeping this place from getting four stars is that it's a little on the pricy side - I bought an order of their (new) Taiwanese style beef and an order of Yang Chow rice, and the total came to almost $20. Entrees come with a small side of boiled rice, probably about 20c worth in the scheme of things. I'd have felt far more comfortable paying about $10-12, and in fact your dollar buys you plenty more food at Chen and Wok down the road, which is almost as tasty (and THEY have pork w/black mushroom! :-) At any rate, Buddha is a great little Chinese place in Surprise, clean, well-run, great selection of food but something that unfortunately I have to consider a rare treat based on cost.",0.0,0.8803937435150146

She had a cup of corn and chicken soup; I, the egg drop soup. When they came, we made sure that our server hadn't mistakenly given us the bowl size. She hadn't. In some places, a cup of soup is usually about two shots worth, but at Wai Wai, the cup is a very generous portion. I found the soup the best part of the meal, though it was probably nothing more than cheap chicken broth and shredded egg whites. The pot of jasmine tea was average and could have used a bit more flavor. \n\nWe shared an order of the honey chicken, again generously portioned. I realize in a place like Wai Wai, raising questions about MSG, as well as whether or not their meat is locally sourced and/or humanely raised (and thus healthy for the consumer) are somewhat unreasonable (even absurd) queries to posit. While my partner and I do care about food awareness and personal health, by choosing to eat here, I suppose we tacitly approved of sloughing off such concerns and slumming it for a meal.

Yeah, my aforementioned ethical concerns were the root cause of this, but the food was very middling. There was nothing terrible about it, but it was just your typical, Americanized, unhealthy Chinese food. \n\nThe server was attentive and friendly; we tipped accordingly.

I hate to say this, because to the contrary of popular belief, there IS such a phenomenon as expensive, high-quality Chinese cuisine that is absolutely worth paying for.

Sure it was good and tasty, but I am absolutely convinced you can find this same taste and quality from a local Asian eatery (probably on Spring Mtn Road) 5 minutes away by car. \n\nService:\n\nI have to admit the service was top-notch. They constantly checked on my table, asked us if we needed anything else, and it made me realize I should focus my criticism not on the staff that was simply working here trying to make a living, but the overzealous owner or hotel mastermind behind this careless restaurant concept. \n\nHere is a warning to those who are planning to use a similar voucher at any of these Palazzo restaurants: they will automatically calculate the 18% gratuity based on your ORIGINAL total, not the discounted total. So while my bill essentially came out to around $50 dollars for two people, the 18% tip was based on a total of course $90. \n\nOverall:\n\nI would probably not come back here again unless there is a miraculous price adjustment to their menu. I would to reiterate that I am a proponent of expensive Chinese food, though it must prove its extra worth through quality and taste.

Is it over-priced. Extraordinarily!  Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  After a long night of party hopping from LAVO, to Marquee, to Tao, being seated in a quiet booth in the corner and lunching on Chinese is the way to go.\n\nThe American ginseng is amazing.  There is a word in Chinese that describes the effect this soup has and I'm not sure if I'm translating it properly, however, drinking this soup really provides a \""healing\"" effect especially after what we put our bodies through in Vegas (8+ hours of 5 inch heels, taking in second-hand smoke...you get the idea).  The bowl is small and runs you $20 for one, although it is SO good.  I was skeptical of the minced beef initially.  It is a dish normally not ordered by the typical Asian person.  It turned out to be generous in portion and very tasty.  The raw egg is stirred into the saucy beef mixture and tossed with the rice.  It is served piping hot in order to cook the egg.  I don't think this dish is on the menu so it must be special ordered.  Finally, the oxtail and tendon soup is good in small doses but a little overwhelming when you're eating a large bowl of it.  This is dish you'll want to share amongst two to three people.  Oxtail is meaty and the satay flavor is strong.\n\nWe enjoyed ourselves so much at Zine, we came here both days for lunch!

Plain and simple.\n       - Value - You're not really getting value from this place. All the dishes are about twice as expensive as your normal Chinese restaurant with only a little better quality. You're pretty much paying to eat at the Palazzo.\n**Ordered**\n       - $10.50 Chilled Jelly Fish - Your standard Jelly Fish appetizer. Portion and quality wise, it's standard (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=ag2_JZA1cw80fMH4y1jGSQ#ag2_JZA1cw80fMH4y1jGSQ).\n       - $19.80 Ma Po Tofu - A decent amount of Tofu with bits of ground meat to keep it filling. It goes great over rice.\n       - $32.00 BBQ Combo - You get 3 choices and we got the duck, pork, and cold chicken. Everything seemed a little higher quality than you'd get at a normal Chinese restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zine-noodles-dim-sum-las-vegas?select=6HIB5tmvQ-dpQfprj4v2Tg#6HIB5tmvQ-dpQfprj4v2Tg).\n       - $18.80 Fu Chow Fried Rice - If I ever come back, it's because of this dish. The concoction of seafood, creamy sauce, and egg over the fried rice is probably one of the best things I've ever tasted.

Secondly, the Chinese buffet my parents used to take me to as a child, the one with scrumptous food, and horrible washrooms was no longer in existance.

As with the seating, the buffet was huge as well.  There were three different tables of dessert and 5-6 of main course dinner items.  I tried to eat a little bit of everything and still stuffed myself like a pig.\n\nOverall, I'd consider the food at Jade better than the Mandarin (and cheaper too!)\n\nHowever if you can help it, don't use the washroom.

The wine came out first, and was actually really delicious, and only $22. The food came out quickly and was good. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but definitely good. There was SO MUCH food. We finished the appetizers, wine and broccoli, but left half the fried rice and 3/4 of the tofu. It was all really delicious- we just couldn't finish it. With our check, they gave us 8 slices of oranges and 3 fortune cookies. Yummy!

The gai lan was cooked perfectly, and the server kindly cut it into smaller pieces when asked (I hate gnawing on large chunks of Chinese broccoli).

A perfect place to spend Chinese New Year.\n\nI can't comment on the Gordon Ramsey thing because I know nothing about it and didn't visit it before it was apparently aired. Either way my first experience there and my visits since have all been great. The basic idea of Chop Chop is to try first hand real Chinese food, in a traditional manner, ordering several small dishes which are brought to you as and when they are ready. This really is a far cry from your usual greasy takeaway. Equally, expect to pay a little more. But when you take into account the quality in comparison, it is more than worth it (it averages out to usually around average to just above average for Edinburgh).\n\nI should also add that as a vegetarian there was plenty for me to choose from, and at that first banquet they went out of their way to ensure there was an equal amount of dishes to try. I found their vegetarian dumplings a little strange at first, but ever since I've started craving them. I also agree Evelyn's comment on the aubergine!  I should add that the staff are really friendly and if you've never been before they will help you with the menu and give you any advice you might need.\n\nA fantastic Chinese restaurant where you can experience some great  Asian cuisine in a traditional manner.\n\nOh but do book early!

Well dumpling don't leave crumbs (unless you suck at chopsticks like myself) \n\nAs for the noodles, don't bother with the peanut sauce one, it was lacking something and sort of felt like melted peanut butter on noodles with that extra crunch if you get my gist. \n\nThe service was very efficient and friendly and we were pleased when they actually brought a jug of water to the table rather than doing the one-glass-at-a-time method which frankly I do not understand. My only small complaint is that we kept getting a different person serving us or coming up to us, sometimes two people coming and asking us if we liked our food within the space of two minutes. Some may read this as keen and helpful. Others as annoying. I will leave that choice to you!\n\nOverall, my feeling towards Chop Chop is to visit it again for something other than the business lunch.

Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner.",0.0,0.9904402494430542

My auntie from HI thought it was good.  For those that know you got it good pass this spot up  \n\nBad-\nService-The same unattentive service you expect expect in chinatown.  Waiters need training and more discipline.  It does not look good to stand around playing on your phone or speaking overly loud where customers can hear your conversations.  \n\nHostesses-not very host like these girls need replacing.  Do some work other than just standing up front and then ducking in the back\n\nI came here for the hand made noodles and thus put in an order and informed only after I ordered that there were none available.  I then asked the waiter to inform me when the chef was making more so we could put in an order.  NOPE had to spot the chef making more and flag down our waiter to order.

Despite finding the style of food I was looking for, the flavors were only a little more engaging than the woman behind the counter.  I REALLY wanted to like this place, but despite the food being a fairly good value, the lack of personality both in the food and owners will prevent me from returning.

I haven't been here in a couple of yrs. It was really good back then.I don't know if they changed management but I will not be returning back. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli w/ garlic sauce and brown rice. Is it me but how come when I ask a Chinese restaurant for brown rice they think I'm talking about fried rice. NO!!! The rice was kind of hard and stale. The shrimp and garlic sauce was a bit on the salty side. \n\nThe rest of the food that the family ate was nothing to write about. You would think since it's conventionally located in a popular shopping plaza they would keep you coming back for more. Sorry house of Leng I'm no longer a fan. Where can I get some descent Chinese food in north Charlotte?,0.0,0.9966625571250916

Banging.   My.   Head.   On.   My.   Steering  wheel!!\n\nWhat is up with trying to get a bite to eat in Middleton?  First I went to Palmyra.  It was closed for good.  As I was Yelping on my phone, I saw a local guy and he recommended Tapas Rias.  So I drove here to Tapas Rias and guess what?  It was closed for good. \n\nNext I go to the gas station to fill up and I ask another local what he recommends.  He said the buffet at the grocery store (Copps Food Center) was great and Imperial Garden has the best Chinese food around. So I pretended to sound interested since he was kind enough to talk with me. However, a grocery store buffet and chinese food...in Middleton?  That's the best a local could offer?  But it got better.  As he gave me directions to Imperial Garden, he explained that the restaurant was attached to a gas station.  UGH!!!  No thank you!\n\nNow I'm frustrated AND hungry and I'm just trying to find some decent food to bring back to the hotel for me and my husband.  \n\nSo on my way to Imperial Gas station....I mean Garden.  I drive by Crandall's.  This place looked like it had good food.  Unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday.  After Yelping a bit more, I looked up Captain Bill's. I wasn't necessarily looking to spend a lot of money, but it sounded good and I was in the area. I passed it up a couple times, but once I found it, there was a sign on the door \""open 5 PM to Close\"".  Well...it was almost 3 PM.  Is this for real people.  I had nothing to eat today.  How can this be? \n\nThank God for Yelp.  I starting Yelping again and looked up more reviews in the Middleton area.  That's when Mharaja Restaurant came up.  I called immediately to find out if they were open...for the day...or at all for that matter.  The man who answered the phone explained that they close at 3 PM. It was 2:51 PM and he was kind enough to wait for me to get there.  I ordered way too much food but it was pretty decent.\n\n***I would have rather had tapas, but as you can see from my photo, it will soon be a little Mexican restaurant called Cocina Real.",0.0,0.9922343492507936

Sometimes, I need a Chinese food fix, and this place is close to my apartment, so I stop in to get Chinese.  Panda Express is the fast food of Chinese, and honestly, its not half bad.  This location is actually one of the nicer ones I've been to, which is an added bonus.\n\nI like it here because they have a nice selection of dishes, and I can walk in and order just about anything.  They let you sample dishes if your not sure your going to like it, which is nice.  Colorful interior, reasonable prices, and you get quite a bit of food and its actually kinda good.  \n\nThe downside, is well, I guess part of the territory.  Every time I come here there's a line.  Sometimes its one or two people, other times its like 9 or 10.  If your starving, that seems like a long line!  (maybe I shouldn't wait so long to feed myself.  LOL)  Service speed is okay, nothing to complain about.  Tables are always clean, supplies are well stocked.\n\nParking is tight here.  There's a few spots, but the lot also doubles as the drive thru line, which BLOWS.  Why? If it's busy, you get blocked in by drive through people, and it takes forever to get out.  Why they did it like this makes no sense to me.  Also, they do not serve crab Rangoon.  I am baffled by this.  They have cheese Rangoon, but NEVER crab.  I prefer crab! I know, I know, my problem and not theirs.\n\nI've never done the drive through, but overall this place is not bad at all!

There was not enough light on, and that was not good for bringing up our appetite. There were only two waitresses who seemed to be new on this job, one of them even accidentally spilled water all over some other costumer.\n\nThe food, well, the flavour is not bad, but it is definitely NOT authentic. We ordered water-boiled pork and fish-flavoured eggplant (sorry guys can't remember what exact English names they put on the menu). These are two of the signature dishes of Sichuan food that I like the most, but what they brought to us was definitely not how these dishes supposed to be. Fish-flavoured? I would call it sweet-and-sour, and trust me, these are totally different flavours. As for water boiled pork, it was supposed to be soupy (guess one can tell by their literal-translated name), but somehow the cook decided to add wet starch and created something different. Again, flavour-wise it is not bad, but I would never call that water boiled pork.\n\nSince later we soon discovered a much, much better Sichuan food place nearby, I will definitely never go back to this dark little place again, and I will not recommend this place to any Chinese friends.

Each piece was fried just right, brimming with crispy, oily perfection. And it costs only $1.95 and was definitely  a favorite among my friends and I. \n\nThe wonton noodle soup was delicious as well. I was looking for something brothy and warm, since I needed to recuperate from the night before. The wontons were crafted perfectly, with a generous helping of meat in the interior and slippery, soft wonton skin on the outside.

The broth is light but flavorful and was perfect for warming up my stomach. \n\nCurry fish balls were delicious too!

Dark, almost Black and with Rice inside - 2 yelp stars\n\nRotisserie Chicken - the skin  had a good flavor!  I'm not a fan of Rotisserie Chicken so I'll stop there!\n\nDessert Case!  Check it out!

So far my favorite is Red 8 at the Wynn.  But I had high hopes for Blossom.  \n\nBlossom's interior is nice, but a little busy.  It fits in well with the rest of Aria.  We were seated right away.  The tables are fairly close together, and if it was really busy, it could have been a bit cramped.

The menu at Blossom is simple and pricey, with some entr\u00e9es at $300+.  \n\nOne item that popped out at me was the \""live fish\"".  I'm hoping this just means fresh fish, not an actual live fish, like the disgusting YouTube video.  I thought about asking, but it's so odd that I thought it might be offensive.  \n\nEverything we had was really good, but I wouldn't say it was good enough to justify the price.  Red 8 is significantly less expensive, and is far better quality food, in my opinion.  I would say that Blossom is more on par with Shanghai Lilly in Mandalay Bay, except at 3X the price.  \n\nI would have rated the place at 3 stars, but something happened that made me add a star for service.  As we were being seated, we were offered drinks.  My girlfriend just asked for a Diet Coke.  I asked her is she wouldn't prefer having a drink to celebrate the fact that this is her birthday dinner.  (she was turning 30, and I thought that would require a drink)  She said no, and we had our dinner.  After dinner the waiter brought over a beautiful, and exotic looking tower of deserts for my girlfriend's birthday.  This was unsolicited, and beyond the call of duty for our server.  The entire staff of Blossom and Aria were top notch, and made everything very pleasant.  \n\nSo in summary, not the best Chinese in Las Vegas, especially for the price.

It isn't hard to see why this place succeeds, though at the same time they do leave something to be desired.\n\nThe big draw of Panda Express is the obvious one - It's a fast, inexpensive way to get Chinese food. They have a variety of items, including chicken, pork, beef, soup, egg rolls, and a variety of drinks, both fountain and bottled. The Orange Chicken is, far and above, their most popular item, and is an excellent choice. The place also has a variety of promotional items on their menu on a regular basis. \n\nOne complaint I have about the establishment, however, is that very few of their restaurants actually have drive-thru windows. The ones I know of that do are Stephanie/American Pacific, Sunset/Sandhill, Warm Springs/Las Vegas Blvd., and Boulder City. There are tons of others, but these are the only ones I know of and have visited on a regular basis.\n\nSadly, the food at Panda is ready-made and waiting under heat lamps. This means no customized orders. \n\nMuch as I like the food here, I do have other complaints. First and foremost, service is second-rate. Ordering through the box, they often mishear my order. At the aforementioned Sunset/Sandhill location. I said I wanted \""fried rice\"" with my Panda Bowl. The woman said back to me \""white rice?\"" I said \""fried rice\"" again to correct her. So why were the next words out of her mouth \""white rice\"" again? There is no such things as \""white rice\""; it is called STEAMED rice. This is just one story of hundreds I could tell. \n\nAdditionally, I usually eat at the Stephanie/American Pacific location, but one time I showed up right at the time it said they opened, and NO ONE showed up to take my order. Your opening time is a contract to your customers, period. BE READY TO SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS AT THAT TIME.\n\nDespite the order mishaps and the lackluster selection of restaurants with a drive-thru window, the food here is quite good. There is bound to be a restaurant near you, so I can give it a firm recommendation.

Therefore, I had pretty high expectations going into the restaurant. I was hoping that it would be authentic stuff.

Everything I ate was sweet, even the things that aren't supposed to be. One of my favourite dim sum foods--the rice wrapped in lotus leaf (jun jue gai) is always made savory, but their's tasted like it was dipped in syrup. They also used bbq pork in the jun jue gai instead of conpoy, mushroom, or even chicken (the GAI in the name means chicken). They used pork instead of chicken.\n\nI ordered a lot of things that day and none of them tasted as they should because everything had some superficial sweetness to it. Cantonese cuisine should not taste so... gaudy. Also, the dim sum variety is quite limited.\n\nAs for the waiters/waitresses, there was only one person that spoke Cantonese there (a guy). I think the others were Mandarin and Filipino. Not really a problem, it was just confusing because there was a waitress that kept speaking Mandarin to me. I kept trying to speak Cantonese, but always had to fall back to English.\n\nConsidering all of the high reviews on Yelp for this restaurant, I was very confused when I left. I came on a weekend for dim sum with two others, and we ordered a lot so we could try everything (bill came down to $20 each, which is absurd for dim sum). Sure, we're not in Toronto so I shouldn't compare with delicious dim sum that usually costs like $5 per person at most. Still, I still think it was unjustifiably expensive.",0.0,0.9903188943862916

For about 90% of those 364 days, I would say I actively dislike Chinese. For one magical day, however, I must get my Chinese fix.\n\nToday was that day. A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went. \n\nHonestly, it's not your traditional Chinese restaurant. In fact, I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you. You don't really see a server except when the food comes. You clear your own table or you pay them to do it. It's kind of absurd how it's all organized.\n\nAt the same time, it's Chinese food I would eat more than once a year. I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn't really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff, it's four stars on the basis of food alone. In addition, when the rice cooker crapped out, the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead. \n\nIt's a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it.",0.0,0.9910486936569214

Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.\n\nWhen I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular \""Chinese\"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.\n\nUpon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name.

Totally not efficient at all.\n\nOnce we finally got a seat, things got worse.\n\nOur \""Har Gow\""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.\n\nThe trademark \""beef internal organs\"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. \n\nThe BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.\n\nI understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. \n\nI don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food.

I can honestly say that Mekong Palace is a gem in Mesa, AZ for authentic HK style food.  \n\nI've been here many times, for a quick lunch, a late night dinner, and a weekend Dim Sum event.  All of my experiences have been great.\n\nFirst, let me talk about their BBQ: roast pork, duck, chicken, etc.  The BBQ which you can buy by the pound or get it over rice for lunch is very good quality.   This reminds me of the Chinese BBQ back in NY.  \n\nFor dinner they offer a nice selection of options ranging from deep fried whole fish to a steamed fish with soy sauce, scallions ,and ginger.

I would ask them if they had a particular dish, and they said they were still cooking them and that they would be ready soon.  To my surprise, when they were ready, the server personally delivered that particular Dim Sum to us.  That act seldom happens at a Dim Sum restaurant partially because the restaurants are usually too busy and because the servers just don't care.  You don't have to worry about that here :-).

Below is what I ordered and my thoughts on it.\n\n* Hainan Chicken (Steamed) with Flavored Rice - the chicken tastes good, but the meat is on the tough side. The rice is slightly flavored, and not the pronounced flavored rice I am used to having when ordering this elsewhere in the past.  ($6.95)\n* Garlic Crispy Chicken WIngs - 6 really plumped and crispy on the outside, yet still very moist on the inside chicken wings. The flavor is spot on for me, and is not too salty and with a nice but not overpowering garlicky taste.  Definitely the star of my dinner and worth trying again.  ($4.95)\n\nThe restaurant is very tiny, the kitchen is probably the same size as the dining area.  When they are washing the pans in the back, you can totally hear it.  Also the decore is very minimalistic, with some pictures hung on the wall and a flat screen tv playing some Cantonese TV series.\n\nWhat I didn't care for: While I was eating, I guess the kitchen staff were on break and some decided to come and hang out in the front to relax or watch a little tv. They were just steps away from the table I was sitting at, so it felt like my personal space was being encroached.\n\nOverall, I considered this a 3 stars operation but their Garlic Crispy Chicken Wings is 5 stars!",0.0,0.9377182722091676

Cleanliness - Bathrooms were clean (a stickler for me), and quite a bit of care has gone into the details of the interior with a nice design. \n\nI really hope Peking Tokyo stays around...good food, friendly staff, clean environment and affordable. \n\nKeep up the good work Peking Tokyo!",1.0,0.996697187423706

I cannot believe that none of the dishes had any flavor except the Tako Su, which I believe had wasabi mixed in the extremely oily sauce, which for Tako Su should not have been oily and the octopus was rough and really hard to find, for Tako Su that's a feat considering that is supposed to be the main ingredient.  I come from NY where we would order 'real' Chinese on a regular basis. I was so disappointed I had to call the restaurant just to let the owner know, maybe he didn't taste the food, who knows.

This place is AMAZING!The BEST Chinese food I've had in a very very long time. My boyfriend and I were craving some Chinese and sick of all of the mediocre delivery places in the area so we turned to yelp (of course) to help us find something new.... we found this place w really good reviews and decided to give it a shot. At first site it is a clean and comfortable casual dining space. Brightly painted modern walls and plenty of two or four person tables. Up front there are some seats occupied by people waiting for  their scrumptious take out. You are greeted nicely by someone who will seat you then get drinks for you (even though there is a soda machine and you can do it yourself) The menu is filled with terrific beef, chicken, pork,duck,lamb and seafood options. Here is the great part, it's not your typical fast food Chinese place the dishes are really restaurant quality.We started with the egg rolls because quite a few reviews mentioned how fresh they were. We got one egg roll and one shrimp egg roll. They were so fresh the cabbage was still crispy. Best egg rolls ever!Then we moved on to the sizzling rice soup which was chock full of large shrimp chicken and pork and freshly added veggies.  I had the szechuan chicken and my boyfriend had the jalapeno steak. The portions are not only generous and like 8 bucks they are prepared so fresh that the veggies are still crisp my favorite. The chicken dish had broccoli, red peppers, onions,water chesnuts,baby corn,mushrooms and the presentation is beautiful.. big pieces of sliced meat, large  veggies nothing diced.The sauces are full of flavor, not salt you can both see and taste your entrees. The jalapeno steak was super delicious and spicy very, very good. It had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, onions, red peppers, chili flakes and some smokey and spicy delicious sauce. I was kind of jealous i'll probably get that next time. Overall this is the best Chinese in Phoenix. They could easily charge 12 bucks a plate.

It's a troublesome process and, it is true that most places do not do it often enough, but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your food.\n\nThe chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all.  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce.  Overly starched and overly salted.  Does not have any flavor at all.

And this is the dude that eats everything. \n\nDear fellow yelpers, stop short changing yourself.  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food.  Neither does big shrimp, crisp cabbage in egg rolls, big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food.  Guys, U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste.  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price, that's perfectly fine too, send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet, seafood or no seafood.

Lin's has a huge pump bottle of A1 near the \""steak\"" area. I mean really... if it's under the guise of Chinese buffet, they sure aren't trying very hard.\n\nSecond, for some reason there is this intense sense of discomfort associated with being at Lin's that I can't really explain, like you just want to scarf down all your food as fast as you can and get the hell out of there. I think it's mostly caused by the crowdedness everywhere. The chairs are pretty close to each other, the people at the buffet seem ravenous and you always have to be careful to not bump into Big Momma behind you who is snatching up all the crawfish, corn on the cob and french fries she can. Nobody goes here for the atmosphere, and usually I don't care at all about things like this, but here it's extreme and you feel very rushed.\n\nI'll go back the next time I have no regard for my health or happiness and just need to gorge myself on cheap food, because the food really isn't too bad, but I would not make Lin's a regular on my list.",0.0,0.9896870255470276

Born in Taipei and grew up in Northern California.  Speak Chinese fluently.  Been to Taiwan ~15 times in the past 10 yrs for business so I do know what hot pot place would look like in both Taiwan and California.\n\nMy family also do hot pot at home once every few months.  Hot pot is a popular home meal in the winter time.  Decided to Came to this place based on Yelp review.\n\nShort conclusion:\nThis is not a typical Chinese hot pot place.  It's a poor attempt at going somewhat upscale from what a typical hot pot place in Asian and SoCal.\n\nTaste:\nTwo sauces are provided without any option.  This is generally a big no-no in hot pot place.  Generally customers are provided with lots of sauce options.\n\nMeat and vegetables are fresh which is about the only good thing.\n\nA few hot pot soup base option.  We chose the original so the kids can eat.\n\nPrice:\nFood price is considered quite high for a hot pot place.  It was $100 for 3 adults and 2 kids.  Serving size is small to medium.  All 5 of us were still somewhat hungry and left to find another restaurant for snacks and drinks.\n\nService:\nService is rather poor.  Had to find the waiter a few times to get anything.  Once in a while, the waiter will come by and shut-off the electrical stove for you without checking with us while something is still cooking in the pot.\n\nNot really sure why other reviews are so positive.  I am guessing that most of them have little or no experience in a Chinese hot pot place prior to this.\n\nSo for people who are expecting a Chinese hot pot place, skip this place.",0.0,0.9989744424819946

(I actually got to take a look at the full menu later but the only thing that was kind of fusion was a taco or two where they used some Chinese ingredients... but didn't sound too appetizing)\n\nSo to try both Chinese and Mexican, I got the breakfast taco and a Chinese pork sandwich.

My friend did, and my initial reservation about the price to size assessment were correct. A typical rou jia mou is something like sauced pork in a flatbread sandwich about five inches in diameter (to simplify the explanation). This one was sized accurately and slipped into a protective waxed paper pocket to keep fingers clean. $8.88 is much too steep for such a \""snack,\"" even in the somewhat stylish surroundings. The meat in the rou jia mou had the same shortcomings that I've seen in other restaurants in the same dish and in beef rolls.

But boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.\n\nThe hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. The server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but I had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something.

Next, was the Beijing Glass noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself.

We split an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and also an order of Red Curry Chicken. The dishes came out fast and looked mouthwatering. The Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of flavor and included peanuts (one of my favorite parts) and some sort of chile but no other vegetables. The chicken seemed poor quality. It felt a little mushy and slightly slimy. I don't think it tasted as good as it looked, I got a little sick of that dish by the end. The red curry chicken was not fried and the the chicken looked and tasted of much better quality. The curry came with the chicken along with an assortment of vegetables all covered in the red curry sauce.

I don't actually like Chinese food. Not, like, I absolutely won't eat it - I'd just never choose it myself. I came here for Paddy H's birthday and so, I should preface this review with that, and state that my twenty-ish quid for the unlimited banquet would have been better value if I'd actually dug into everything properly instead of tentatively nibbling and then just waiting for more chicken dumplings to arrive. It's already not cheap as meals go, even all-you-can-eat ones.\n\nHowever, my rating is based entirely on the experience as a whole and not my own personal foodie preference (because that would be just daft). Besides, I was informed by the gentleman on my left, who had spent no small amount of time living in China, that what we were indulging in was in fact extremely good, albeit the geographic and cultural equivalent of serving linguine, sangria, falafel and bratwurst on the same table.\n\nI believe I've mentioned my tapas hesitancy before - how I cling desperately to my favourite thing and guard it, snarling, from others' hands. This is also a large part of my problem with Chinese meals. This is not, however, a problem with the Chop Chop banquet - you can simply ask for more! MORE! MOAAAAAAAR!\n\nSimultaneously the good and bad side to this is that everything is made fresh to order, so if you don't ask well before you've finished what's already on the table, you're left sitting for a goodly while before more sails toward you. And, in the case of my beloved chicken dumplings, you might have to ask a couple of times. Given the size of the place and the number of replenishing orders they must take from people, it's unsurprising and somewhat forgiveable that the occasional order goes astray.\n\nThe staff were efficient, if not overly friendly, and attended our table frequently. The real highlight for me, though, was the glittery tables. Just like Christmas in my mum's kitchen! Red glitter everywhere, yay!\n\nSo - it's just fine, and on nights of better service this is a definite four-star place, but my own experience on this occasion, with some hyper-extended waits combined with a fairly high meal price, registers at a positive three.",0.0,0.9884670972824096

The Chinese dumplings are around $8-$10 for around 8-10 dumplings. That's a dollar each. These are literally the same dumplings you can get at an Asian grocery store. I usually pay $8 for a bag of 30 dumplings. Doing the math makes me very confused at DumplingHaus' pricing level. The baozi is a similar hilarity -- $6 for 2-4 baozi. You can buy larger baozi than the ones they serve here for less. Another specialty here is their noodle bowls. You definitely won't get full on one bowl of this as they really cut back on the amount of noodles and toppings you get. \n\nNow, I mentioned that the idea is smart. I give credit to that.

Upon walking into the restaurant, expectations were high since the decor is notably more modern than the usual Chinese restaurant ambience and currently residing in Henderson, I was optimistic towards the prospect of a decent dim sum joint without having to make the trek towards Spring Mountain.  From start to finish, I'd have to say the quality of the dim sum was consistently meh.  My mom, dad, and sister joined me and I found it problematic that each dish had some undeniable flaw that found all four of us consistently in unanimous agreement.   \n\nTemperature: a marker of good quality (and signs of active turnover) is how hot the dishes are when they arrive at your table.  Virtually every dish was room temperature on arrival, and even after we requested a fresh one or that they reheat a dish, it came back lukewarm at best.  \n\nTexture: The daikon cakes were gelatinous and missing the crispy edges, the long flat rice noodle filled with shrimp were overcooked, and the shrimp dumplings (the benchmark for dim sum) had skins that were gummy.  Even the salt and pepper squid (pretty much a staple at any Chinese restaurant) was coated in a dark brown batter that resembled the KFC extra crispy batter rather than the air-y tempura batter that barely coats the the natural contours of the squid pieces.\n\nService: My sister and I had a recent discussion regarding the rise of Korean and Japanese cuisine in the states and the relative stagnation of Chinese food.  One of the things which are done well in the former two is service and it's almost an anticipated assumption that any decent Chinese restaurant will have either rude servers or mismatched silverware/plates since as a cultural whole, neatness and courtesy are not heavily emphasized as you would normally expect when walking into a Korean/Japanese restaurant.  Folks here seem apathetic and inattentive, which is all the more surprisingly considering the grand opening was within the past few weeks.\n\nMy mother, who usually can be quite forgiving towards Chinese food, summed it up best (paraphrased from Chinese):\n\n\""If our friends ever invite us to this place, I will probably have to make up some excuse for our unavailability so as to avoid coming back\""\n\nThere's dim sum, and then some....and this is definitely the latter.",0.0,0.954891800880432

It has a neat and inviting decor. It has a good selection of Lunch Specials of typical Chinese cuisines; complete with soup, chips, and a side of rice or fried Chowmein, for $6 or $7 each, thus, of excellent value.\n\nThe waitresses are very friendly and quite accommodating.\n- The Szechuan Spicy Chicken I ordered had excellent aroma, texture and presentation, but surprisingly, it was unsually \""too SWEET\"" at every bite! I asked kindly and half-jokingly my friendly server if the chef had used sugar instead of salt by any chance. She was helpful and accommodating, and actually went to talk to the chef about it, who said it was no mistake, but was totally WILLING to re-make the dish with less sugar! Well, to me, that is a mark of good business practice, I was impressed.\n- Yes, I have had Szechuan style spicy dishes in restaurants in SZECHUAN, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and in a few Chinatowns in the States, but no, I have never tasted a Szechuan dish with such sweetness before. Well, at least the chef at ChinaTango was willing to remake the dish! The helpful waitress offered her good advice that the next time I order, make sure to ask the chef to go easy with the sugar! Good advice, I'll definitely go back and give it another try.\n\n- Based on the happy faces of other customers, the cuisines must be pretty good in general. I'll definitely go back there and try other items in the menu.\n\nBy the way, another plus for this Chinese Caf\u00e9: - It has a very CLEAN bathroom, complete with paper towels.\n\nPeterskis3\n12/16/11\n--",1.0,0.9968156218528748

But I go in around 10, the place is really dead, and I try to order. The guy looks at me like I'm an idiot and says Dim Sum is only mornings. \""We're authentic\"" he says with an attitude normally reserved for the French.\n\nFair enough, I think. I've been to China, I know the drill. This is traditionally a morning thing, although they didn't give me grief when I was in Hong Kong asking for it for a later lunch, but whatever, we're going authentic here.\n\nIt would seem that the authenticity ends with the serving times, because the food was about as authentic as Panda Express. I'll say it falls more between PF Changs and Panda Express, but I don't think you'll find any Chinese willing to use the word authentic to describe any of those establishments either. \n\nTo be frank, the food kinda sucked. And the service was practically non-existent. The food came out quick, which is good, but keep in mind no one else was ordering. But then it got dropped off, no asking if everything's cool, and the guy then heads back to a table where the servers seem to be eating their dinner. \n\nIt's cool, I know everyone has to eat, but I don't think I'm being overly snobby to say that if our waiter is taking his dinner break, give us another waiter. After a 5 minute attempt to politely get his attention, I finally got up to retrieve a bottle of soy sauce myself. Not the end of the world, but not the type of service one would expect for a $60 dinner for two. \n\nGetting the check was a near similar hassle, but thankfully I was able to divert his attention away from the big TV long enough to drop that off. \n\nOh, and you know how when you get fortune cookies, not here, they're to \""authentic\"" for such Tom Foolery, but at other low quality places?

If you're in Vegas looking for a decent Chinese place, as a local I'd recommend Red 8 in the Wynn. It's not really any more expensive, it's much nicer, the servers are top notch, bordering on hovering, and the food is genuinely authentic, and fantastic.

Saw all these great reviews and decided to give it a try. Came here at around 5:30 p.m. to an empty house...it was still empty when I left after 6 p.m.\n\nA little early for dinner but this being near Chinatown did not make sense.  Ordered the Beef pot and it came with like 5 thin slices of beef cooked already in the pot...oh well, they had side dishes so ordered a side of squid and fish balls.  \n\nThe squid rings looked really sad, like it had been frozen for years and finally defrosted, all dried and swiveled up...asked the waitress what's up with that and can I exchange it for something else...can't believe she said NO and insisted that it was fresh...said that it came in a bag from supermarket and they defrosted it and since they boiled it before putting on a plate for me, they can't take it back. I asked her to look at it since it did not look fresh but she kept insisting it was fresh. I did not want to argue any further and it was just 2.99 for the sides so I just let it go. \n\nI felt sorry for the empty restaurant  and ordered another side of noodles since I wasn't going to eat the squid. $9.99 for the beef pot and 3 sides, a total of around $20.00 (not a lot of money) with only 5 thin slices of cooked beef and 6 fish balls and a sad plate of overcooked noodles, just felt cheated. I was not going to write a review but leaving the restaurant, feeling hungry and used, I just feel that I have to warn those who might think about trying this hole in the wall...It's even more sad when you are eating somewhere by yourself and run into bad food and bad customer service.\n\nNoodle Exchange is 100 times better and being a hotel, I think it's a lot safer.",0.0,0.999530553817749

(for $14?!?)\nEverything was at least $10 except the soups that were around $6.\n\nThe waitresses spoke to us in Chinese; however I felt that they didn't understand what we said or ordered because they got our order wrong and could not understand when we asked for a container for soup and a plastic spoon in Chinese. \nThey seemed more fluent in Cantonese I don't see why we couldnt just communicate in English.\n\nThe food was also very salty. Everything we ordered was super salty almost unbearable.\n\nWhat really got me was how overpriced these plates were. Being Taiwanese Chinese and vegetarian for 3 years, I can vouch that other chinese vegetarian places would not charge as much. \nTheyre usually around $8 per plate and for a plate of steamed veggies would NOT be $14! It would be much cheaper than the regular plate, around $6-7.",0.0,0.9980722665786744

Except, there's none in Cave Creek/Carefree worth eating.  But we had stopped at Home Depot in Anthem and we see the sign for Hong Kong Asian and thought---hey!\n\nI don't know why people are complaining about the pricing.  It was right on par with the Chinese restaurants in our old hometown.  I ordered the Pan Fried Noodles and DH went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I also added the egg roll and cream cheese wonton to my meal and we ordered a hot and sour soup to share.\n\nOkay, the soup was maybe a dollar more for the same quantity.  And at our old place, for 3.95 you could combo up to an eggroll AND soup.  But I have noticed that AZ restaurants are really stingy on their \""add-ons\"".\n\nYou know, it wasn't bad.  Not fabulous, but it was the first *real* Chinese we have had in a year.  There was plenty of beef, pork, chicken and shrimp in my nicely sauced noodles---they don't skimp on the proteins----and lots of tender/crisp veggies.  Same for DH's Kung Pao.  The egg roll had a crisp exterior, but the inside was bland and mushy.  The cream cheese wonton was tasty---I could have munched many of those.  The hot and sour soup lacked a depth of flavor that I was accustomed to at our old fave.\n\nI have to agree, though, it was salty.  Not so much that it was inedible, but after the first bite, I removed my rings because I knew there was some finger-swelling in my future.  But frankly, we overlooked that in our pleasure of *real* Chinese for the first time in a long time!  I wonder if you can ask them to pull back on the salt?  Or if they even read these comments and can tweak the kitchen on their own?\n\nWe took our meals home, but the restaurant looked quite clean, though the decor was nothing to get excited about.  About half the tables were full and there was a steady stream of folks picking up their carry-out.  The guy at the counter was polite, if not warm and fuzzy.\n\nOh---and quantity---we each got two meals out of our containers.  I think that's reasonable.\n\nBecause of the salt, I probably would have gone with a 2.5 star rating, but you know how Yelp is.  Whole numbers only.\n\nWe'll be back.  It's 14 miles from our Cave Creek home to Hong Kong Asian, but our previous home was eleven miles from town and Chinese, so....  The joys of country living.  :)",0.0,0.8770783543586731

No.  A Chinese buffet?  No.  Chain restaurant PF Chang's?  No.  An 1980s-decorated Chinese sit-down restaurant?  Definitely, no.   That's when he remembered seeing a new place being built in Matthews.  We drove by Ming Fu to see if it was open yet.  We had been at this establishment before just a couple of years ago when it was a burger place.  It was very nicely decorated inside before, but walking into Ming Fu now, you wouldn't even recognize it from before.  They've totally redone the inside and gave it a very modern, calming Zen-like feel.  It was beautifully, yet simply, decorated, and I was already immediately impressed upon walking in the doorway.  \n\nThe menu options were very diverse without being overwhelming like at some Chinese restaurants.  There were decent typical Chinese $10ish meals or, if you wanted to get something a little more high-end, there were $15ish meals.  We opted for the first, along with a couple of cups of soup.  \n\nOur server brought out complimentary fried Chinese noodles with a spicy mustard and sweet and sour dipping sauce, and all of these were tasty.  The hot and sour soup was good, but not as flavorful, peppery, or spicy as some I've had.  The Sa Cha Chicken entree (broccoli, water chestnuts, snap peas, brown sauce) was very good, too, with a \""just right\""-sized portion served on modern dinnerware.  Although denoted as spicy, it too wasn't anywhere what I'd call spicy.  I like some heat!  Some sriracha or hot chile sauce/paste on the table would have been a much welcome addition.  I had to resort to adding heat by using the Chinese mustard.  \n\nThe service was great and friendly, and we're definitely going back.  The atmosphere alone is awesome, and then you get the bonus of a very reasonably priced, good Chinese meal.",1.0,0.9976818561553956

Not so much...I've been here twice and both times I have had painfully long dining experiences. The first time I ate at QC at least the food was decent (hence the 2-star rating), this second time around everything was terrible.\n\nFirst mistake = coming here on Christmas Day (around 5:30pm) - but I had nothing at home to eat, and there weren't many dining options open except for Chinese. George & Son's had a 50 minute wait, and we were quoted 20 minutes at QC so we decided to eat here.\n\nWe walked in to a fairly full restaurant, and our first red flag should have been the sight of the staff (all 5 of them) frantically running around, except for a young 10-year old girl who was seating guests....\n\nIt took quite a bit of time to get our drinks and appetizers out to the table but the real disaster came with the time we had to wait for our entrees. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entree plates, it had to be at least 45 minutes. In that time we saw multiple tables get up and leave due to not having any service, which at first was amusing, and then turned to annoyance. \n\nRepeatedly there was a gentleman (who seemed to have come into the restaurant to help his buddies during dinner service because they were so backed up) who told tables, \""sorry folks, we didn't think we'd be so busy today!\"" Well - it is Christmas, and you're the only restaurant open...c'mon man.\n\nWhen the food finally got to our table, the same gentleman came with the plates and said to us, \""Does this look like the food you ordered?\"" Uhh, what!? You tell me guy, you're the one who works here...plus almost all Chinese food looks the same, so, sure?\n\nThe last straw was that the food was terrible, cold, and unappetizing. Poor marks all around. Running a restaurant when you're slow is easy, a true mark of a decent restaurant is managing and being capable when you're busy.\n\nI know its Chinese food, but still, let's keep some sort of standards here folks.

Also, the aggressive service would benefit from a little organization/toning down. If the cashier doesn't like taking orders, that's fine.

It's in a decrepit part of town and the front is windowless and looks like an old hardware store. The only thing that convinced me to keep going was the cute, friendly panda on their sign (when has a panda ever been the cause of a person's demise?) and once I parked there was another sign that indicated I was not the first to hesitate when approaching the building. \n\nWhen I walked in, I think I entered through the kitchen door because I literally walked through what looked like a kitchen. That opened up into what looked like a living room (or a karaoke room?) I kept going until I got to the dining room. I was seated at a table and waited for my friend. He entered through a different door and apparently that one came right into the actual restaurant dining area. (Note to self for next time - choose the door on the left).\n\nFood was awesome. Green beans and eggplant with beef were my favorite. Everything was very authentic and it drew a mixed crowd which was great to see in Mesa. \n\nI loved the food so much I wanted to bring my mom here for Mother's Day dinner but decided on something a little more picturesque in the end. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try more of their menu.

They do it right and have some twists to their Cantonese style cooking that we love.  One of those is the \""Szechuan spicy won ton.\""  These are soft won tons in a spicy brown gravy, warm but not hot.  The sauce is of the peanut variety and the won ton dough is \""slimy\"" in texture, but they are DELICIOUOS. It is not on the menu so ask for it, in fact, if you are heading there, call ahead to insure that they will set aside an order or two for you.\n\nMy wife and I fought over the final one and ended up making a second order which we laughed through as we slurped them down.  So yummy will go there today for lunch.\n\nTheir won ton soup is PERFECT, being golden yellow, flavorful and not greasy or infused with soya sauce.  Marvelous with those soft delicate won tons.  Do wish that they would have a larger order and one with vegetables.  Will have to ask for the \""wor won ton\"" type of soup.\n\nI find that the portions are fair, but not generous.  Rice is a measured bowl and the servings are OK for two people, but far short of what you get at other places.  You might find that where you order two mains you might want an appetizer or a third main.\n\nAnd don't expect spicy. Cantonese food is generally not spicy, so please ask if they will juice it up if you like more zip to their dishes.  Some dishes they will and others, no.  Chef's call.\n\nIt was no surprise to me when I found out that the chef of this family-owned restaurant is the former chef of Wan Fu in Charlotte.  This is another reason to know who is in the kitchen.  It makes a lot of difference.\n\nJade Dragon is located in Quail Hollow, off of Rea Road in South Charlotte.

Both the sesame and general tso chicken. My California roll was HOT from being packaged with my meal. We decided to call gh and not risk eating anything. Zen's wound up calling us, and tried to tell us that they cut the chicken bigger than normal, and that's why it was under cooked. That may be, but from my time in the food industry, I know that everything leaving a kitchen should be temped before serving. Raw chicken can kill someone and shut down a business. They also told me that their California rolls were meant to be served hot.  What we did taste (some sauce, the egg roll, a bite of rice) was mediocre at best, so needless to say, our search for good Chinese in the Burgh continues.",0.0,0.9977908134460448

I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. \n\nMenu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. \n\nThe Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.\n\nOverall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either.

I wanted to like it, but I just did not like the food. The crispy chicken chow mien noodles were the type you get out of a can or bag, not the real thing. The other items were pretty standard Chinese-American fare. Honestly, I like Panda better, and it is cheaper.

Beautifully thick looking sauce and a nice portion sized per $.  I took my first bite hoping for the best and it was soooooo close.  Amazing flavor for a quick cheap spot, but yet again over salted and that was pretty much the story of the meal.  Even the eggroll tasted overly salty.  That is the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars in my book.\n\nMaybe I was off kilter, maybe my taste buds were overly sensitive, that did come to mind once the eggroll wrapper tasted so briny.

I wish there was a separate listing for the restaurant but according to the receipt, it falls under the same name and address.  \nI had passed by the marketplace many times and never stopped there but on this recent trip to Vegas, I was finally curious enough to go in.  I was also hungry, so when I saw the Chinese restaurant, I decided to get the 2 item combo (4.99).\nThis seemed like the typical pre-prepared Chinese food type of place, like a Panda Express, so I wasn't expecting gourmet food but still something half-way decent.\nWell, this place exceeded all expectations...in a bad way.  From the first bite, I could tell this food was something \""special\"", something so gross and disgusting that I could barely force myself to try a second bite.  Just for reference, I've eaten my share of iffy food and filled myself many times at cheap Chinese food buffets so I don't have unrealistic expectations.\nWell, this food was probably the worst I've had that I can recall.  The chow mein was greasy, the chicken was tough and they both seemed like they were cooked at least a day before if not much longer...in rancid oil that should have been discarded a week before.  The meat tasted as if it came from chickens dead of old age or disease...or at least what I imagine those taste like.\nEven if I could have fought back the gagging and swallowed it, I was too afraid of the expected digestive and perhaps other health effects to even attempt it.\nSilly me, I was so outraged at this revolting food being served that I asked for a refund even though I was almost certain I would not be given one.  \nWell, of course, I was not given one.  The kind of business who serves this kind of food does not exactly care about customer satisfaction.\nNow, I usually hate wasting food but tossed this in the trash with no hesitation.  Then again, this could hardly be worthy of the name \""food.\""\nThere is no reason to eat here when there is much better cheap food to be had in Vegas.",0.0,0.9992316961288452

Its authentic Sichuan Chinese food has drawn so many people to its wonderful central location at State and Gilman. I at least have dined more than 10 times during 2009-2010 and have been constantly happy with its food. Back then, only Wah Kee Noodle was the other \""Authentic\"" Chinese place on my radar. \n\nBut you know, restaurants are precarious business. \n\nSince 2009, there has been a revolution in the Chinese food scene in Madison. I can count almost 10 new authentic Chinese restaurants joining the competition. Ichiban, Oriental House, Double 10, Dumpling Haus, Hong Kong Station, to name a few. Fugu was no longer unique, and I have settled with Ichiban for Sichuan food in the past couple of years. \n\nEarlier this week, I went back to Fugu and was totally disappointed. The dining space was under-staffed with only two people handling 50 people. Through the whole time of our dinner, servers never had time to clean up dirty dishes left by previous customers. When we left, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. A group of people came but was unable to be seated. So they left. It was ugly. Plus, there were flies accompanying our dinner. \n\nWe had 5 dishes, but they slowly came during a 30-mins period. The fast and accurate service was gone. \n\nFood was good but inconsistent. Water-boiled beef and Tofu Fish were really good, but somehow our stirred fried pea shoot, the easiest and overpriced dish of all, was messed up. Too much salt. \n\nMy experience sounds really bad, but I tend to think it was an anomaly rather than the standard. Therefore I gave it a 3 star instead of 2.

Not at all spicy as it claimed to be and was covered in onions.\nPork fried rice was decent. I'd order this again.\nEgg drop soup was also tasty and glad it wasn't salty.\nWon ton soup broth was delicious, but a bit salty and the won tons were definitely pre frozen and the pork inside the won ton was rubbery and tasted like jerky.

Chopstix is a new Chinese restaurant on Green and 2nd.  My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. \n\nThe girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. \n\nAnyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again.

The name tells you everything you need to know going into the place, it's a mixture of Italian and Chinese cuisines.  There a few Italian-only and Chinese-only dishes, and five fusion dishes.  All are priced between $4.00-$6.00, so no breaking the bank here.\n\nI wanted a little kick in my meal, so I went for the Szechuan Angel: angel hair pasta with chicken tossed in a spicy peanut sauce (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=mOwNIOGbhJLhNgWX9NUVFQ).  My entree came with a side salad and two pieces of garlic bread.  The salad had an odd dressing that I couldn't quite place; some bites tasted of sesame, others of citrus or orange.  The garlic bread was good as it was also topped with pesto.\n\nThe real downside to the Szechuan Angel dish is that it wasn't spicy at all.  That was the main reason I ordered it, so that was a bummer.  The peanut flavor was a lot more subtle than other peanut sauces I've had; this can be a good or bad thing depending on your palate.  I was fine with it, I just wished it were spicy.  The entree is a generous portion and decent deal at $5.00.\n\nMany of the sides are only $1.00, so I also ordered the Curry Beef Puffs (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z57kLRRnYXcaIhFZnxNJCA?select=gUUVV5Zuapt7sL3TXNHq5g).  The filling is ground beef cooked with a yellow curry.  I've never had ground beef with curry before, but it turns out better than you would think.  It would be better if there were a stronger curry flavor!\n\nOverall you're getting a well portioned meal for no more than $6.00, and sides are cheap enough where you can order one while still eating for less than $10.  I think the food is decent, but your mileage may vary depending on your expectations and palate.  I'll be back again to explore the rest of the menu!",1.0,0.93448007106781

Crispy noodle dishes were awesome.

That isn't saying much considering that an easy and fairly bland dish that is.  But the chicken had a good texture and the breading was right.  They had a lot of dishes that I enjoy, but most were dried out or almost empty.  The coconut shrimp looks like it would have been very tasty, but all that remained in the dish were remnants of sauce and one lonely shrimp.   I tried both the hot and sour and won ton soup.  The wonton soup had good flavor, but the won tons were dried out, again probably because they had been sitting a while.  The hot and sour was not horrible but not great either.\nService was nonexistent.  I had to go to the register area (where the person was playing games on her phone) in order to ask for a refill on my water.  \nNot a great overall experience and the food was meh, but for the price, ($10) you aren't spending that much more then you would have on fast food and had a larger variety.",0.0,0.9987019300460817
