It was hidden a little in the shopping center, but the sign was fine.  I was greated upon entry.  I took a look around and was a little shocked that the building could look that old, outdated and in desperate need of repair and upgrade.  The girl behind the counter was very nice and explained everything to me.  She took me into the room and showed me how to use the bed.  I was very impressed with the actual bed equipment.  It was a high grade just like I had seen at other salons.  However  -the good stops there.  The room is about 3 feet by 3 feet larger than the bed.  There was a single chair there for my purse, clothes, jewelry, ect.   No hooks or shelves or anything.  During the tanning - I pushed the \""mister\"" button - and what a surprise - it didnt work.  I tried several times during my 12 minutes of tanning and still didnt work.  When I was done - i went to get dressed and realized that there was no mirror in the room. Neither was there a tissue, deodorant, wipes, or lotion, or anything else that most tanning salons have in the rooms.  I was shocked.  SO after being heated up, wind blown, no misters....there was no mirror to check myself.  So when I went out of the room - I asked for the bathroom.  Down the hall....And surprise - nothing in there either.  Well, there was a mirror.  I did tell the attendant about the mister and she said she would let management know.  I would never pay the $70 a month they want for that package for a place that has no amenities at all.  And it is now the next morning and I have not even a hint of tan from the most amount of minutes they will allow in their highest bed.  Dont even go there for the free tan.

It worked great, though was definitely scary with cracks and bare bulbs.\n\nWhen I came back 2 weeks after associate told me I used up all my sessions and she knows nothing about it. I asked her to look up the days I came in, as expected there were only 2 days I came in on and I bought 3 sessions. She said in the system I was switched to something else and she couldnt do anything about it.\n\nShe did not have manager's contact info, could not give me any refund and could not give me a session per her words. How does one working at a tanning salon have no manager contact info? What if there is fire? Someone burned? Inspection came in? Robbery happened?\n\nAlso phrases like \""I don't care\"", \""I can't do anything about it\"", \""Maybe she will call you\"" - are not acceptable in service industry in this context.\n\nI am extremely displeased and disappointed. If manager chooses to limit what their associates can do to resolve issues such as refunds, comping sessions, changing things in the system - they should either be on site of accessible 100% of time.\n\nBest,\nNataliya",0.0,0.9990696310997008

In the last week I try to come back to them now their telling me I owe them $260.00 . I have not used their services since now I cant join until I pay the full amount. I even went inside to talk to the owner she refuses to work with me, I am willing to pay the amount the account been frozen and some late fees. Its not my fault they never contacted me. I even try to call the corporate office they called me once.

I called ahead of time to get the scoop on how to prep.  I swear to you the chick on the phone told me to moisturize.  I thought that was weird because I had heard you're not supposed to put lotion on before you spray tan.  Well, I figured maybe I'm out of the loop, so I did it.  I went in, got sprayed and...

Have you ever seen that Friends spray tan episode where Ross gets a spray tan on level 4 like 4 times on one side?  That was me!!!\n\nSo I came out, the chick took one pitiful look at me and was like, we'll give you another go round.  I was so \""burnt\"" from this horrible experience I figured I'd take a week off and try again.  So the week came and went and I made SURE not to lather up with anything!  \n\nI went in, spray spray spray... didn't look like I had chicken pox again and showed up a couple hours later with a pretty decent looking tan.

I'm interested to see how long it will last (I'll be sure to update!).  \n\nThe rooms are very clean but service can be hit or miss.

A contract is good for 10 months where you're paying 60 a month, and to cancel, its a whopping $200! Really?! As if it's an important association. It's a TANNING salon! Aside from that, its limited to Nevada so its practically impossible to move without practically selling them your lung. In addition, they don't offer other benefits within their contract. I visited another tanning salon where my friend is a member, and to avoid possible thoughts that I'm an employee there, I'm going to keep the name anonymous. Anyway, it's the same price and they treat their \""VIP\"" members with monthly facial red light treatments, hydration stations and water massage beds. To sum my frustration up, as part of the customer service industry, I'm well aware that exemplary customer service is what brings people back to businesses. That being said, being excessively ripped off by Body Heat tanning is enough cause to avoid this place at all costs in the future.

I had a similar experience as the other reviewer Brian A. They were recently bought and became affiliated with Celebrity Tanning and I had bought multiple spray tans a few months prior. When I went to the location at Tatum and Cave creek, I said I wanted a spray tan. She proceeded to tell me how many people weren't transferred over from the previous owner so she has no way of knowing if I have tans or not but will have someone call me. I was expecting this to be a quick in and out but now I'm filling in a form to be entered in the computer, am worried I've lost money if they don't find my tans. Then after all of that she says the machine is broken right when I think we are done and I can tan! She sends me up the road to the celebrity tan where it got worse.  It is more expensive than it ever was before. Frustrated to buy a tan when I already have some, been given the run around, I'm not in the computer and they can't call a manager about my tans. Kids running the place that have no idea about making something right with a customer. Left there leaving my phone number for the mgr to call me about my tans. They never called. I called them and they said they found I have 3 tans when I had 7. Went to use one and they have a new machine ( tatum location) and it turned me orange. Previous machine never did that. They can keep my two remaining tans that would just  make me orange.

I don't think twice except i'll MAKE SURE to ask next time someone else is working besides her. \n\nSo next time I tan, I ask... and sure enough she only put 3.

If you wanna charge more just be up front about it. I'm not stingy, I could pay 50-100$ a month for a tan, I HAVE BEFORE. \n\nAnother recommendation would be stop putting little cards and useless crap advertising in the actual tanning bed. Put a table or something then the customer doesn't have to waste time and effort removing it every time they tan.",0.0,0.9988118410110474

I had dark spot on my stomach and she did not move the disposable undies to get an even tan all over so I had a white strip down my crack and around my hips.

I bought a living social voucher and when I tried to use the 3rd of my spray on tans within the 30 days they were closed early due to an issue and I was unable to use it. I went back a cpl weeks later because I couldnt get there sooner and explained what happen and the girl working would not let me use the 3rd tan. I did speak to the manager and he offerded a half off tan but to me its poor customer service to not honer 1 spray on tan when they know they were closed during posted business hours. I live far so to go there twice and not be able to use that final tan was a waste of my time and gas and I have no desire to spend money where the customer doesnt come first. I am waiting for a responce from living social on a partial refund..If you buy a voucher make sure you read the fine print and verify the terms. 39$ for 30 days of red light therapy + 3 spray on tans and botton of voucher says promotional value expires in Dec didnt sound like I had to use all 3 spary ons in 30 days.,0.0,0.999237895011902
