I read all the reviews and almost passed this place because of negative reviews.\nI am going to say that it depends on you.  If you search for a restaurant by who the chef is and what awards he has won nationally, then this isn't the place for you - actually no buffet is for you.  HOWEVER,  I AM a foodie, so I am a bit picky.  I want flavor and don't want it covered by salt or sugar.  \n\n     6 of us enjoyed the breakfast without any complaints. The omelet station was full of every option we could think of.  And the omelet cook had skills.  One of the group couldn't figure out what to add (so many options) so he suggested that he make him the omelet that he cooks for himself.  Excellent job!\nThey had 2 soups on the buffet - turkey and seafood bisque.  Generally a seafood bisque has no seafood - I was pleasantly surprised - and I commented that I would have been proud to have called it mine.  (and I make an amazing seafood chowder).\n     \n     The options for breakfast we as you would expect:  pancakes, waffles,salads, sandwiches, fruit, all the breakfast meats, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy and the rest of what you would expect.  \n\n     Right on the way to Hoover Dam - really - it is a light in the middle of the road to turn in.  And no wait at 12:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  The dining room wait staff was sufficient - her name was Miami Florida - she did just fine - I don't expect the Four Seasons service if I am not at the Four Seasons (their brunch is 40.00)\n\n    Didn't have room for dessert - (none of us could fit anything else)  so I'm not going to provide a review for them.\n\nMy goal is to let you know that if you are interested in having a low priced breakfast, even on Sunday morning - you will be well satisfied.",1.0,0.970414102077484

The food was decent nothing blew me away but there is something for everyone. But its just ok.. I wouldnt say omg you have to go to this buffett. This was actually voted one of the top 5 buffet in vegas and I def dont think so. Ive been to the Monte Carlo buffet and I think the quality of food there was better and it was cheaper. The waiter was very slow with clearing tables and refilling drinks. Granted we are drinking straight champagne at 10am but still do your job. \n\n\nThe hotel Aria itself is very modern and quite stunning. Would I return to this buffet again ... prob not when there are others with better food quality.,1.0,0.9928916692733764

They had a little of everything... an omelet bar (a brunch staple), pancakes, waffles and French toast, all the eggs, bacon and sausage one could ask for.  The buffet had a salad bar, a little Mexican food, a little Chinese food, some sushi, and a touch of Italian.  The dessert bar was adorned with beautiful confections and various types of gelato.  The real star of the show were the crab legs.  Mounded high like fresh picked corn at a farmer's market, the crab was plentiful.  Served with drawn butter and lemon wedges, it was chilled and delicious.  The only thing lacking... a little crab fork.\nOur plates were cleared quickly and our server was friendly and generous with the mimosa refills.

I only enjoyed the penne pasta with marinara...the most simple thing on there to eat, but that's all I liked.
