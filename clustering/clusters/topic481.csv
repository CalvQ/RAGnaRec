First time was 5 stars. Looks like it is under new management since last time I visited. Constantly trying to up sell. Tried to get an extra $10 for the clear coat. \n\nPlus now they have a window chip repair onsite- another up sell. Told me there were tiny chips in the windshield and wanted to change my insurance. \n\nDidn't even clean my cup holder. \n\nI will never go again. Find another place,0.0,0.9991719722747804

I would use Mountainside Glass again and recommend.\n\nJesse did inform me that he fixed the wind noise by taking off the strip at the top of the windshield, cleaning it off, and applying new adhesive.
