Went with the other reviews and tried Genaro's. This was some of the best food ever and we eat out a lot, everywhere and all cuisines. The rotisserie chicken held up to the reviews as the BEST we've  ever had! The sauces were crazy fantastic too. From the Aguadito soup to the plantains to the cilantro rice to the most awesome Tres Leches. Wow. If you're in the area or anywhere  near Pineville, NC definitely recommend. Service and recommendations  from Luis were greatly appreciated  as well. 5 stars. We are bookmarking  this one and are so happy it's only 1/2 hour away:-)",1.0,0.9997944235801696

I had the Chicken Chop Suey and she had Sweet & Sour Chicken.  We started with an order of Steamed Dumplings.  The dumplings were great.  They had a lot of meat in them.  The Chop Suey was made with a white sauce.  I am used to it being made with a brown sauce.  That did not matter as it was delicious.  The S&S Chicken was wonderful as well.  The S&S sauce that came with it was not laden with all that bright red food coloring.  Very tasty.   She also got an Egg Roll.  It was huge!  We had to split it.  Niiice.  And, even though you order and pick your food up at a counter, the service was great.  I ordered a Chicken Lo Main to go for my son and she asked me if I wanted them to wait a bit before they cooked it.  I like that!  That tells me that they care about our experience after I pay them!!  A plus!  We've passed this place up numerous times.  Not any more.  We'll be back!",1.0,0.9986788630485536

I always get some form of the chicken strips.  Most recently I ordered some new Buffalo hot strips that are covered in buffalo hot sauce.  They were pretty good.  I wish the sauce was a bit spicier but I realize I am not the average person, I like really hot and spicy foods.  The sides are one of my favorite parts of Popeye's chicken.  I usually get the red beans and rice, but the mashed potatoes and gravy are very good as well. Price wise, I think they are hit and miss.  I usually only come here when they have some special that sounds good or is cheap.  They do seem to have a lot of additional options which look expensive to me.  BTW:  You can order your strips regular or with a spicy seasoning cooked into them.",1.0,0.8519944548606873

First off, the chicken was cold, tasteless, and was hard like it had been cooked for quite a while before we ordered it. Secondly, the chicken wasn't any different than the breaded frozen chicken tenderloins that you can purchase at Sam's club. Finally, one would think that a place named Parmezan Subs would specialize in Parmesan Chicken Subs and that this particular item on the menu would be a safe bet for flavor and value.
