For the most part the bartenders have been great, but sometimes if they are busy they will not even acknowledge you are there. \n\nFood Review: The calamari was so-so on flavor, but wins points for not having a rubbery texture. The dill pickles were very good, and the cheese plate was astounding! Very good aged cheeses and Wisconsin made mustards. \n\nThe desserts have also been good. The Chocolate mouse is. to. die. for! This is not your 'whip cream' chocolate mousse. This is thick, rich, slightly salty chocolate decadence. Pair it with the beignets for a delicious treat. The banana's Foster is also pretty good. They also serve French Press Coffee, which is a definite bonus.\n\nnow, the entrees. This is where the rating loses a star for me.

The next time I went and ordered the scallops (without looking at the menu, which is my fault) They were served with some veggies and sweet potato puree. it wasn't bad, but it was more bland.

It's free to get in most of the time too, though the most popular nights (Friday/Saturday after 11pm) now charge - never more than \u00a35 unless there's a big name guest playing. These charges were introduced with consultation with the Jazz Bar clientele, and ensure that the musicians are paid fairly, so are not to be grudged. You'll need to get there early to get a seat on the busy nights, but if you get there before the door charge kicks in you don't have to pay to stay, so it makes sense...\n\n\n The music ranges from pretty straight jazz, such as the Saturday night house quintet (usually unrehearsed but great quality musicians) to funk jams and DJs late nights through the week. The programme has also recently branched out into singer-songwriter nights and even poetry nights, usually run by external promoters. The quality of musicians is almost always superb though, Edinburgh boasting some of the country's finest young jazz musicians.\n\n\n Drinks are in the upper end of Edinburgh's price range, \u00a33 for a pint of San Miguel (at least it's decent beer!) but this is to be expected in such a small place.

Next time we'll try the wines - they had a really good $20/per person for 4 wines and an appetizer on weekend nights that we'd like to order.  \n\nThe attire seemed to be jeans and a dressy top.  It was a pretty casual and relaxed atmosphere.",1.0,0.9995379447937012

The interior was uninteresting but comfortable enough, and the service was average.  \nThe second time I went, however, I found out the hard way that they have a strictly enforced dress code that is pretentious and ridiculous.  I wore dark jeans, shirt, sweater, new converses and a leather jacket, but due to my \""tennis shoes\"" the greeter refused to seat me and told me that I (and by default my friend) had to leave.  Specifically, I was told that I could wear - for example - sweatpants, but that tennis shoes or sneakers were strictly forbidden.  (Perhaps next time I should pair baggy sweatpants with dress shoes; I would certainly be a stylish addition to their clientele!)  They also have a sign saying that one must be thirty or older to enter, which is simply absurd (especially since an important part of keeping jazz alive is engaging younger players and fans).   Management seriously needs to lighten up; CJ's is not the type of place where such arbitrary rules should be enforced so strictly.\nBottom line: go for the Thursday night jam session, but plan your outfit accordingly.",1.0,0.96288001537323

I quickly tuned into my reliable source for great reviews....Yelp and was excited to see the great reviews for Hasaki.  So...I made a few u-turns...and turned a corner or two...and found offstreet parking within a half block of the restaurant.  Entering...it was quiet....just a couple of patrons.  The ambience was very nice.  It had the comfortable feel of a nice place to eat.  So...my quest began for a simple meal...an d a nice vino or beer....and what started out as a 5 star rating...began to go down fairly quickly.  I took away a half star because the waiter had no knowledge of the specials...or what was the most popular items.  Also, no knowledge of how dishes were prepared or what was included.  So...had to wing it.  Started with the spring rolls...and found that they were processed items out of freezer box!  That meant another 1/2 star.  Down to 4....could it get worse?  I was hoping it would not.  So, I started on my second appetizer...the jumbo fried shrimp tempura...OK...that was good!  And as I searched for my pinot noir...it was not to be found.  Nearly 10 mins after ordering....there was a challenge uncorking the bottle.  OK...so the liquor license was just issued....aaaaaaahhhhh no excuses. (down to 3 stars)  OK...on to the main entree.... Hibachi chicken with mushrooms....no...I had to have brocolli...something green.  OK...the entree arrived.... and the chicken was very chewy...tough....and almost tasteless. I wish I could stay with 3...but down to 2 stars.   Had to season with soy and Tabasco.  It was quite a challenge getting through the meal.  Fortunately....the other entree ordered was filling.  The hibachi shrimp with rice!\nOK....so maybe on a Friday night....it was just difficult to get it all right!  Perhaps I will try again.....sometime I will get back for sushi and add some stars back to this rating!!!",0.0,0.9962570667266846

Firstly, my food was delicious and everyone I was with said the same about what they ordered. My burger was cooked perfectly. I had pulled pork & bacon on it and the BBQ sauce was dripping with flavor, ahhh. One of my favorite burgers I've had to date.\nThe ambiance was just okay which is where the three stars come from. We went on a Friday night to hear the live jazz band that was playing. Jazz  bands play in the basement of the place. It's dark down there and has a big pub feel to it which is cool. It's crazy loud though! I spent the evening screaming to my friends and was grateful for times when the band would take intermission to be able to talk at a normal level.\nThe band was fun and really talented. It was great seeing them goof off on stage. It wasn't exactly bluesy New Orleans jazz though; more like a muddling of jazz, pittsburgh polka, and rock. \nIt was a good time with a group of 4. Taking a date there is probably a bad idea if you want to talk. You could always grab a table on the main level though I suppose where it seemed to be quieter. But even if you can't talk, the tasty food will keep you busy in those inaudible times of jazzy inspiration.",1.0,0.9981414079666138

The musicians that play there are some of the best in the city, and I like how there are two sections, so you know that the people who choose to sit in the speakeasy are going to actually appreciate/listen to the music. The menu has a great selection of drinks and food. I have yet to order something I didn't like. I also think it's nice how there is a different cover for sitting at a table vs. sitting at the bar. As a music student who is still in college, it is not always easy for me to put down $15 just to be able to sit in during a jam session. At Little E's, I was constantly pestered for money (even for a glass of water with my meal).

My friend had eaten here the other day and said it was very,very good so I suggested going and I'm so glad we did! This was such a neat atmosphere-very old-timey yet sophisticated and we could hear lots of great jazz music coming from inside (which later we discovered was live downstairs in the speakeasy). Their cocktail list featured a lot of prohibition style drinks-I ordered a whiskey sour and my boyfriend ordered a vesper martini. The drinks were hand-crafted nicely and very tasty, enough so that we each had 2. For food, many items looked tasty but I settled on the pulled pork sandwich (the honey-chipotle BBQ sauce was exactly what i was craving at that moment so i was sold immediately). The coleslaw was on the side and it lacked flavor but I used a little on top of my sandwich and the BBQ sauce meshed with the coleslaw nicely. House chips came on the side. They wer eok, nothing to talk about. My boyfriend ordered 12 wings, 6 tequilla lime and 6 chipotle BBQ. I tried a tequilla lime and was not impressed but then again that is not a flavor I would have ordered myself. When we were leaving we popped quickly downstairs to check out the speakeasy and I cannot wait to go back to hear music there! It's a really neat environment to see jazz in and my boyfriend being a band director who plays the trumpet as well is very into jazz (obviously) and was already talking about coming back before we even left. Overall, this is a really cool spot (it is a little pricey but not over the top-basically on par with the trendier restaurants in Pittsburgh) and I'd like to sample more of the food to get a better idea of the overall food quality but I'm so thrilled we have now found a new place to see great live jazz if nothing else!",1.0,0.9774737358093262
