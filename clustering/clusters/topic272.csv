As a person who have worked in a dental industry for last ten years, I know the average cost and what other doctors are charging. These guys were trying to charge me close to $1,400 for a dental crown (after my dental insurance coverage). This is ridiculous amount of money they are charging. It only cost them $50-$90 fabricate the dental crown from a lab. This is almost an implant crown price. By the way, most doctors that I have known only charges $600-$800 for a dental crown (which is reasonable due to labor and overhead costs). They charge me more than $200 for simple cleaning and a couple of x-rays. I had this similar procedures done in California for $75. By the way, I had a filling done less than 2 years, and this inexperience doctor recommended me to get a dental crown, which is a major red flag. For your information, run away from the doctors who recommend, veneers, dental crowns, implants, and bleaching right away. Veneers and dental crowns are major dental procedures and will affect you permanently. For bleaching, you should not do it unless you really have bad staining. Bleaching will turn your teeth partially grey, and you will have difficulty matching your shade if you ever have to do veneers or crowns. Dentists should always recommend least invasive procedure to maintain the natural teeth.",0.0,0.9983922839164734

Fourth, the office staff is super pleasant.  I had a minor mishap with my insurance not covering some work, and when I called to clear it up, there was no chastising for not having paid on time (I thought my insurance had taken care of all of it, oops).  \n\nLet's put it this way, I live on the west side of Vegas and I travel all the way to Horizon Ridge in Henderson to see the dentist, and with gas prices the way they are, that's saying A LOT.",1.0,0.9944913387298584

I was able to get an appointment with Dr. Lam within a week.  The office is very nice and clean.  The staff is very friendly and was very welcoming.  Jacky made sure that I understood what my insurance would cover and what my costs would be.  Rex was very thorough in my dental cleaning.  Fabi was very friendly and kept making sure I was comfortable while getting my x-rays.  Dr. Lam was very thorough in his examination and made sure I knew exactly what he was referring by showing me the pictures and x-rays and describing what he was seeing.  It was discovered that I had a small cavity and I was able to get it filled that same day.  They provided headphones and pandora music for me to listen to while they scraped away at my teeth.  They were very fast, efficient, clean, welcoming and friendly.  I did not hesitate to make my next 6 month appointment.",1.0,0.9995656609535216

My cosmetic procedure changed my life in about a half a day. I had some bad crowns, bite was messed up, etc... Dr. created a model and the very next day we went to work in the morning. \n\nBy noon I had a fantastic smile and the experience was positive. I had surprisingly little pain after getting approximately 12 teeth prepped for crowns. \n\nHis pain management, coupled with his friendly and competent staff, assures me I will return to this practice whenever I need work done.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Jackson!",1.0,0.9992338418960572

I have completed my Invisalign services here and my teeth are perfect. My family also drives 6 hours from San Diego to her office and they love her too. The phenomenal work ethic and talent that dr.
