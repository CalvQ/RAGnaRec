I've taken family and friends visiting from out of town and I've visited just because it would make for a lovely Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfternoon tea seating is in the lobby of the hotel where they set up low tables and comfy seating  - perfect for a relaxing afternoon. The only thing you have to decide on is your tea. You are offered a menu to choose your tea - it's a pretty wide selection  - but my favorite is the vanilla.  Depending on the time of year, they also have special teas such as a holiday tea.\n\nThe rest of your tea consists of a preset selection of tea sandwiches, scones and pastries. It all comes out on beautiful china and tiered serving trays. The sandwiches and pastries do sometimes change with the seasons but they are all very good.\n\nThe service is very attentive. Patricia, the server we see most often, is great. She recognizes us and is so welcoming each time we visit. She even remembers where we like to sit :)\n\nAfternoon tea is offered only Tuesday through Saturday from 1:00 - 5:00pm so I do recommend reservations on Saturday.  And it is a leisurely experience, so expect to hang out and relax.",1.0,0.9995278120040894

We both had the Grand Royale Tea which included unlimited sparkling wine and tea plus the three course tea menu.\n\nTheir finger sandwiches are very good, though, I wanted a little more salmon on my smoked salmon offering. I enjoyed the ham and asparagus one and the chicken salad was lovely. The scones were amazing and their homemade lemon curd went wonderfully on the cranberry one.

We all chose different ones so we can test the other tea flavors. There is also a tiered display of tea sandwiches and tea cakes that they bring out for your table.

We had the Lavender, Jasmin and Oolong tea. Mild and aromatic.\n\nThen we chose our tea sandwiches which were pretty good but the scones with the devonshire cream and lemon curd were so delicious!  yummm!!! (Definitely a must try!) They also served some sweet mini deserts which were very good. \n\nOverall Service was great and attentive and everything tasted great.",1.0,0.999726951122284

Scone's were hard.  Desserts varied from subpar to pretty decent.  The worst part was the tea which was not even as good as good as what you can get from Pete's.  It wasn't even just my tea.  I went in a group of ten and tried some of the other ones and they were all just okay.  What you really get is decor and ambiance but honestly the place is located in the middle of a casino and there is casino visibly all around you even when you are seated inside.  I can't say ingredients are much better or quality was better... nothing was really better to justify the price premiums.   Even service was only average.\n\nI gave an extra star though cause i did like the lemon custard.  Try to always find a positive.  It helps you get through life.,0.0,0.6094733476638794

You could only get one flavor of tea or had to pay extra for an additional flavor. All the tea sandwiches were on plain white bread with mayonnaise based salads which were disgusting. For the price, they could have used croissants. I have been to high teas that were not in the most sophisticated of places, unlike the Frick, and they still gave you more gourmet tea sandwiches than the Frick Cafe. Would not recommend this cafe for high tea.",0.0,0.9993597865104676

But the tea could be much better. When I asked where it was from they said Canada. Seems strange to get tea from Canada Mandarin can do better. \n\nI love the view its a great spot to have a tea and the finger sandwiches were excellent.,1.0,0.9992414712905884
