For those who know me, I am a nocturnal gambler and for me, that means either sleeping in during the day or trying to find some activity to do. As I was browsing through the magazine in my room, the ad for the Shark Reef Aquarium caught my eye. Hopped in a cab and off I went to The Mandalay Bay. The aquarium in itself wasn't really what I thought it would be, I was expecting more exhibits like the ones they have at the Maui Ocean Center or Waikiki Aquarium. The highlight of this aquarium is the large tank with various sharks, jacks, grouper and my favorite, the sawfish. I waited for like 20 minutes for that guy to swim by and show his saw so I could take a picture! There's a tunnel you walk through also that you can take pics of the fish swimming above you. I enjoyed my outing there because I'm a saltwater fish enthusiast, but maybe the admission price was a little high. Oh well, saltwater aquariums are costly to maintain.",0.0,0.9882510304450988

Did not see any Great Whites though. Guess Monterey Bay Aquarium is one of the few places that does house a Great White.\nThey also have a shark exhibit tunnel, which offers a closer look at the sharks.\n\nAll in all, a nice place to stop by if you have kids with you.

You could easily tear out a wall and put in several more species of fish. I will give them credit for the main display, the shark tank themed like a sunked ship was massive. You could barely make up the back of the tank from the viewing area. Thats it thou, everything else was interesting but non-exciting.
