The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\n\nSo why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!\n\nHappy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!\n\nI ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.\n\nMy recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!",1.0,0.987036406993866

I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain.

I can never pass up the crispy tofu (which is also great at Mad Mex) -- it's the perfect balance of sweet and tart. For dinner, I realize the menu changes all the time, but if you ever come across it, I highly recommend the butternut squash soup as a starter. It's delicious! It's filling on its own (almost), but naturally I followed it with one of the noodle bowls with chicken, which was just spicy enough with flavorful chicken and vegetables.  The curry dishes are excellent, too. Soba service has always been friendly and attentive, and I love the dimly lit atmosphere and decor, particularly the waterfall wall. Meals are on the pricer side, but it's a nice night out, so it makes up for it (appetizers are around $12, meals are around $18-38 each).\n\nThey have excellent cocktails for happy hour, too, even if they are a bit on the pricey side ($10-13).

You got people doing all kinds of balancing acts with one plate of ground beef, another with taco shells and some even trying to balance a third plate with a potato burrito I think and some fruit and broccoli. Give us bigger plates - we are adults. Tried a few tacos and they were OK.

The three of us ordered:\n\n- Sea bass and tofu hot/clay pot : Bubbling cauldron with pieces of fish coated in a breading and well-marinated tofu. This was highly recommended and while tasty, became soggy fast and the textures didn't do it for me. There were also random pieces of char siu that struck me as incongruous. \n- Salt and pepper pork : Kind of like pork nuggets. Juicy, crispy and easy to eat a whole piece in one bite, these disappeared but would've been more memorable with the right sauce. \n- Scrambled eggs with char siu : One of my favorites from the meal. The eggs were well cooked and had nice little bits of char siu- some of the pieces of pork were burnt, which ruined the creaminess from the eggs\n- Half roast duck : Lots of bony pieces, but the meat was juicy and the skin had a nice crackle to it. The dipping sauce was great!\n- Steamed dumplings : Just ok. \n\nOur whole meal, including a large bowl of free soup and a huge bowl of rice, came out to $46 or so. Awesome!\n\nOverall the food was better than the average americanized chinese, but I wasn't magically transported to Hong Kong or anything.

I have only eaten dinner at the downtown Austin location.\n\nThis is my Arizona friend's favorite happy hour spot. The few times he is up for a happy hour, we go here. The happy hour is confined to the bar area (saloon) and the patio. Be cautious of the wait for the indoor seating. The Roaring Fork happy hour is not a secret. Try the patio, you will usually have better luck getting a seat.\n\nMy friend only gets one thing: the Big Ass Burger, cooked medium rare. He loves it. The Longhorn cheddar, the bacon, and especially the poblano pepper. He is a little disappointed that over the years, the Big Ass Burger has gone from one pound of meat to two-thirds of a pound. However, this fact does not stop him from devouring the burger. Five stars for the burger.\n\nWe split the guac and chips. The guacamole is wonderful and I love the presentation. For me, this appetizer is totally worth $6. \n\nI usually munch on the friend's fries and drink my mojitos, as there are not very many vegetarian options at Roaring Fork. The mojito is decent and the margarita is good too. I'll have to try the Huckleberry marg next time. (I hear it's great!)\n\nAll in all, a great happy hour location.

The HH menu is large and I ended up with Blue Corn Enchiladas (one shrimp and one chicken) with rice and beans for $9.25. Most other food was around this price range or at least over 7 bucks. The enchiladas came out steaming hot and it is way better to let the cheese cool off before eating this dish. Great chicken and shrimp and tasty Mexican Rice.

The poppers ($22) weren't on the happy hour menu and came with 3 tuna balls and 3 yellowtail balls, each served raw on top of fried rice patties.

Came here for the famous happy hour and $1 oysters at the bar and was disappointed to learn that they'd changed their happy hour menu more than a year ago (according to our server) and no longer offer the $1 oysters or $15 pitchers of Sangria. Annoyingly, as we were walking to the restaurant through MGM, the PA system came on reminding everyone to hit up SEABLUE for $1 oysters for Happy Hour. They really need to update that 'cause it's false advertising, jerks. They also no longer carry lobster corndogs.\n\nRegardless, the new \""bar menu\"" (they don't have a happy hour menu anymore) is available from 5:30-10pm or so, and they offer a $12 for 6 oysters deal and a few other items, so we ordered 12 oysters (only offer Fanny Bay--pretty good), stuffed clams (an order comes with 2) and chicken skewers (2 or 3 3\"" skewers) which I believe were $5 per plate. We also ordered duck fat fries from the full menu since I'd seen them in so many yelp reviews. For $11, they were good but not amazing. The baconnaise the fries come with was awesome though.\n\nWe also got $5 glasses of Sangria which tasted more like water than wine or fruit. Disappointing.\n\nServicewise, was just okay. The server was sort of rude about the whole happy hour debacle, and then was kind of creepy and linger-y while we were eating.\n\nI won't be back for \""happy hour\"" at SEABLUE unless I'm staying at MGM and craving oysters like crazy.",0.0,0.9954907298088074

We were the only ones in there which I thought was a shame.  For all 3 of us, the bill was around $50, and we ate a ton and had adult beverages as well.  What a deal!  The weekend happy hour is extended...noon to six I think.  This beats an uptight brunch any day!  So, we had laksa, sweet chili chicken wings, roti, pork satay, and crispy duck...all good.  I wouldn't say the duck was actually crispy though, but it was still really good.  The satay was so flavorful and tender.  The wings were sweet, sticky, spicy, and wonderously crispy.  Roti was buttery and served with curry broth.  And the laksa, which I've been wanting to try, was a meal in itself (for 3).  I think it would make a great hangover remedy...warm and comforting and spicy.   I brought the girls here the following week.  We ordered all of the same stuff, plus calamari satay which was the best, extra orders of roti, and large amounts of wine. We sat on the patio even though it was over 100 degrees outside, but with the misters, it felt great.  It was a little busier this time around so the service was not quite up to par with the first visit.

We had late dinner reservations so I was looking for a spot where I could grab a delicious cocktail and a small bite or two and not stand out like some creeper. Two points for Japonais! The menu offers a smallish but varied selection of small plates and two different specialty cocktails, all for $7 each. I believe there were some special beer and wine selections as well for even cheaper. I tried one of each cocktail (hey, I was in Vegas!). Cucumber passion was tasty but a bit sweet. The Floating Orchid was absolutely lovely - looked beautiful, tasted delicious, not overly syrupy. I read in a review that the orchid was edible and got a rather hilarious look from the gentleman to my right when I ever so delicately ripped a chunk off it with my teeth. Maybe it's \""edible,\"" but that doesn' t mean you gotta eat it, ladies.\n\nFor my bites, I had the yellowtail and scallion roll and the lobster spring rolls. Spring rolls were fine, but I probably would have preferred another sushi roll - it was deelish.

Pretty crappy considering all the restaurants that surround it had 4-7 happy hours with $5 drinks and aps.  Also, the happy hour food options did not match the website.  I did not see Kobe Cap Pastrami Slider, Baked Crab Dip, or Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho as options.  But you can get hummus. For $6.  Yay.\n\nHappy hour drink selections were also very limited but they did have 3 wines by the glass at happy hour prices that were not listed.  After I had a crappy melon mojito, the server informed me that there were secret wine selections.  I got a pretty awesome glass of sparkling wine for $6.  So make sure to ask about those specials. \n\nSince I went, it looks like they've at least partially updated their website to the right hours.

The beers are reasonable; five dollars for my Marzen and 5.50 for his summer seasonal. \n\nThe service was attentive enough to where we got our waters refilled, but nothing more.

First, the place looks so good it makes even me look good in it.  The entrance is a long walkway surrounded by floor to ceiling windows behind which are hundreds of wine bottles stacked, well, floor to ceiling. The staff all ooze cool while at the same time executing some of the most solicitous service I can think of in town right now.  Their signature cocktails are amazing, and their bartenders know just the right way to make them.  At $8 a pop during HH, that's a mighty fine deal for top shelf liquor done right.  Food is $7 on the HH menu, so of course we tried just about every one, and they were outstanding.  Ok, I have to fess up, the lobster mac & cheese was really boring, but that was the only boring thing this evening.  I guess they have live music some nights, and I hear they're thinking about offering bourbon flights.  Bourbon flights??  That's a bit beyond my league, but it could be fun to watch.  \n\nBest of all, Bourbon Steak's HH goes until 7, which gives me plenty of time to fill up on the value menu and still get my old butt home in time to crash at a decent hour.",1.0,0.9955841898918152

We went their for happy hour since we were staying at the hotel and we didn't want to go out again.  We sat at the bar and decided to try a few happy hour menu items and also a couple of items from the regular menu.  The positives - our bartender was very knowledgeable about the food and provided great service.  The wine list is also extensive.  The food is just ok and given the value, it is less than okay.  The not so positives - We started with deep fried macaroni & cheese - it was good but not memorable.  The duck fat french fries (3 different kinds with three different sauces) were very good.  They were crispy and the sauces were flavorful.  The pulled pork sliders with some cream corn pudding sauce.  The sliders had very little taste, buns were dry and the sauce was not edible.  The philly cheesesteak springroll with carmelized onions and spicy ketchup was very good.  Small appetizers for $5 each.  We tried the tuna tartare $19 - tuna was fresh, habanero infused sesame oil was overpowering in sesame flavor.  it also came with diced pears, hot peppers and pine nuts - again, sesame oil overpowerered everything.  Happy hour wines $5 were okay.  The bourbon malt adult milkshake was very good.\n\nOverall, overpriced for the taste of the food.  I don't mind paying good money if it is good - I definitely wouldn't return to this place.  It wasn't awful, just not worth wasting a meal there.

The nice bites of pickled spiciness was a welcoming palate cleanser. The spinach artichoke dip was decadent and rich. It comes with the same flat bread you get once you sit down. The bisteca salad was a huge wedge that comes with a creamy dressing. Tossing some balsamic with it made it better.

Not only was the fish dry, but the size of the fish in the taco was about the size of my pinky finger. The seasoning was of a likeable taste, but it was drowning under a big mound of coleslaw. Definitely not a happy hour item I would recommend.\n\nThe macadamia nut goat cheese for $5.00 was pretty good. It is a small portion (like a small scoop portion) garnished with a sweet mango salsa. It was had a nice sweet flavor with a good macadamia crunch! \n\nI also tried the lobster bisque which was good too. A good cream density with a great sweet bisque flavor. It had very subtle pieces of lobster in their, but it was still a good eat! \n\nThe desserts as usual are on point! As always I chose the Pina Colada cake which is my favorite cake of all time. It never fails. However, I did come across a new infatuation with the pineapple creme bruelee. So sue me for being super overly excited that it's serve in a pineapple dish! Don't start worrying that maybe with the nice presentation that they may hold out on the pineapple chunks. The creme brulee has two layers of pineapple in it, and then the actual brulee on top of it. Oh it was such a good combination. Who knew that pineapple and creme brulee would taste so good!\n\nIf the happy hour doesn't improve in quality, I do hope they bring back their 3 course menu special. (Hint. Hint.

It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the patio. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised by the HH prices. Bud lights for $2 and ANY other draft for 2.50. And while they don't have an extensive draft selection it is a good one. Specialty drinks were only $4. My friend and I had a cucumber gin/vodka drink that was very refreshing and delicious. My other friend had a cranberry martini. I usually don't like cranberry martinis but I tasted it and it was really good. They sprinkle cinnamon on top which I think is a fantastic touch. It tasted a bit like Christmas! \n\nFor food we ordered 2 orders of fries and 2 happy hour pizzas, one margarita and one cheese. Their fries are to die for! They rival the garlic fries at Gordon Biersch. Smothered with garlic, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Yum. The pizzas were pretty good. Thin crust, flavorful sauce and cheese. We ordered pretty basic pizza so I'm pretty curious about how their more adventurous pizzas taste.\n\nSo what was the damage for 4 girls with 4 drinks, 2 pizzas, and 2 orders of fries? Under $40.

The food is good but the service was even better. Our waitress Nicolle provided some of the best service we've had at any restaurant in quite some time.

For happy hour beers on tap are $3, wine is $4, and appetizers are half off.\n\nHere's what we got (all appetizers):\n- Potstickers: pork dumplings w/ szechwan sauce. Cooked perfectly and tasted great.\n\n- Baked Goat Cheese: goat cheese surrounded with marinara. Comes with garlic toast. Nicolle brought out more bread when she saw we were out. It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.\n\n- Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.\n\n- Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city. The fried onions were pretty sad -- tiny stringy pieces of onions that were over fried.\n\nSome of the wines were decent. Beer was good. Food is about 3 stars, service was 5 stars.

I went there for a happy hour with coworkers on a Thursday and was pleasantly surprised to find it was half price bottles of wine. Awesome. Now which bottle do I choose?  I like red and there was quite a selection to choose from.  I strolled over to the bar to make my selection. The bartenders allowed me to taste my potential selections before committing to a bottle. When I finally decided what bottle to choose they were out of stock. Darn!  I allowed the choice of a 90.00 dollar bottle Shiraz for the price of the one that was out of stock which was 50.00. So essentially I paid 25.00 for a 90.00 bottle of wine. Even Better! The wine was excellent and went well with the mushroom we ordered. I will also add for those that do not care for wine there is a nice beer selection. Not your crappy beers either. Good stuff.\n\nOur group ordered several selections from the appetizers list and we were all pleased with food. The mushrooms and hummus were very tasty. The atmosphere was relaxing with a slightly older crowd but a few younger folks mixed in as well. Water refills were plentiful as well. \n\nMy only reason for 4 stars rating was that you had to go to the bar for your drinks instead of someone serving it to you. We have another event planned in about a month so it is well worth the return visit. \n\nAnother tip: They offer mega tastings on a Saturday afternoon once a quarter where you can taste 20 to 40 wines for a nominal fee. I will need to check that out and give a detailed report. That is if I can remember it well enough to provide a review. That's it for now folks.,1.0,0.9877712726593018

The veal meatball was just totally mushy and came with the same awful marinara. The apple salad was the only item that showed some promise, if it hadn't been terribly over-dressed, and at $7, it's certainly a great value.

The first time we were there was for Happy hour since we were told that it was $2 wells and half off of some food. Score! right?!...  kind of. I had ordered a blood orange vodka premium drink that was $4 and okay tasting, while my friends got wells. Our waitress appeared to be out of it, rarely checked on us and over charged us on our bill ($4 for wells and premiums? that just doesn't make sense) and when we questioned it, she said she was not sure and asked her manager. The manager i guess had squared away the bill, we paid and went on our way. My friends who bill was wrong ended up having the original pricing charged to her card.\n\nWhy we decided to return baffled me but friends were there so we met up again. I think it was the allure of $2 wells and us thinking that maybe by then they had their servers better educated for happy hour service. Plus i was hungry,...Wrong! Our server this time was better, but again when it came to the bill had charged us $4 for wells, and had to talk to the manager, again, who thankfully took care of us. \n\nNow for the food. I ordered the pork tacos with mango salsa. The tortillas were delicious but i had wished there was a bit more pork on there and more salsa, it just wasn't very much. but for $3 i wasn't really complaining either!

They also changed the recipes on the pork tacos (pray they did not change the fried fish ones, OR ELSE!) Not only that, but the tacos are not even discounted for happy hour. What. The. Hell.

Who cares what oyster farm they came from because they're $1 each!!   Nicely sized and pretty good!\n\nNow check out PJ's Famous Sliders\nhttp://bit.ly/XADMzK\nNow you know why I put quotations.  Sliders?  Are you kidding me?  To me, sliders are little burgers that you can stuff in your mouth with one or two bites.  These suckers were huuuuge!!  Very tasty and also complimented the oysters very well.  It's almost a steal at $1.50 each.\n\nWashed it all down with a $3 Blue Moon which is another great Happy Hour deal.  So all together, half dozen oysters, two sliders, and a Blue Moon came to a whopping $12 before tax and tip.  Awesome!!!\n\nI'd say next to the Prime-time Bites at Palm Restaurant, this is probably one of the best Happy Hour deals on the Strip.

They know how to make great drinks, that are not too sweet which is why I consider them to be the perfect liquid chefs. If you dine on the restaurant side, Dennis is the best server!

The host also was unaware as to what was half-priced and what was not, he was probably new so it's not a big deal.  \n\nYou can tell they've changed very little from the previous Claim Jumper decor, \""those elk horns must be from a Japanese elk,\"" and the space just feels too massive for this type of restaurant. Our waiter did great, was comfortable to talk with, but did not seem to know everything about the menu when we tried asking questions. Most of these issues were not deal breakers at all. \n\nThe food definitely tasted above average. The spicy tuna roll and the dynamite roll were our favorites. The sushi was fresh was enough to satisfy. The prices were very good as we were able to get 5 rolls and two drinks for under $30. \n\nIf you're looking for a trendy ambiance and a mind-blowing dining experience, this isn't the place for you.

We waited maybe only 15 minutes and they gave us samples of their vanilla and chocolate concretes which kept me even more happy and satisfied. \n\nThis is by far the largest Shake Shack I have ever been to. Lots of ample seating inside and outside. Heating lamps outside for those chilly winter nights. Decor is super modern and yet comfy. Service was great as usual and food was done super quick. This is a very friendly and efficient staff considering it was grand opening and there are sometimes hiccups. But I saw no hiccups. They were all a machine and happily working.\n\nMy fiance and I got the Stack Shack which is my personal favorite. I love the cheesy portabello mushroom with my burger. I also normally get their vanilla shake but this time we changed it up and got their special which was the salted caramel shake. I am so glad we did. This shake was phenomenal and so delicious and creamy! It wasn't too sweet. It was just perfection.\n\nJust as a heads up, Shake Shack is technically not connected to a specific hotel. It is located in between NYNY and Monte Carlo. You can't miss it!\n\nAhh even as I am writing this, I am craving their shakes. Their shakes are phenomenal.

No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \""yes, it's got lemon in it.\"" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\"" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks.

At first they were a little confused, but after finding out that it was 75% off, they quickly started perusing through the cocktail and tapas menu.\n\nLet me just break down our orders for you:\nPrime Rib Sliders (Chef's special for the night) - $10\nCalamari - $8\nPitcher of Red Sangria - $28\nEspressotini - $10\nPerfect passion - $10\nDreamsicle - $10\nAlmondtini - $10\nBourbon Cookie - $10\n\nThe prime rib sliders were just a little too salty for my taste, but my bro and Don still liked them. The calamari was SO DELICIOUS. They were kind of cut up in cubes, which was different, but the breading was perfectly seasoned and the texture was was a nice combo between crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The Red Sangria was A LOT for a the price (not that everything else wasn't). It came in a large pitcher and two big cups that came filled to the rim. The Espressotini was probably my favorite. It wasn't too strong and it tasted exactly as described. The perfect passion was okay, just a little to light for my taste. I thought the Dreamsicle was also just okay, but my brother happened to like it a lot. The almondtini was very flavorful and tasted like pure almond extract (in a good way); the waitress even admitted it was her favorite. The Bourbon Cookie was too strong for me. It was one of those \""Okay, I'm just gonna f*ck you up so you guys can leave already\"" drinks. Overall, it was an awesome experience to try so many creative drinks and apps for 24 bucks. Even though the drinks didn't suit my taste, my brother and Don enjoyed them very much. \n\nWhen our bill came, our discount total was $72!!! The tax was $0.06 and our TOTAL amount owed was only $24.06!! It completely blew me away. My brother even acted like a baller and threw down $30 saying, \""I got this bitches.\""\n\nHonestly, can you think of a better happy hour than this? Because I sure can't.

We were very pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe staff was all very attractive and very nice.  \n\nThe happy hour options are great!  Loads of choices.  The sake sangria and lychee martini were quite tasty but will sneak up on you! Yikes!   \n\nIt is very nice that the happy hour menu is offered in the entire restaurant.  You don't have to worry about cramming into a tiny bar or lounge space.  We were seated at a nice table just like any other diner.  \n\nKabuki is very nice inside and the food presentation was flawless.  Just about everything we ordered was a win!   The only miss I recall was the tofu appetizer.  Bland and boring.  The fried mozzarella wrapped in seaweed were clever and tasty!\n\nI'll definitely return and you should go check it out!,1.0,0.9997697472572328

While I was slightly disappointed in the complete lack of happy hour drink or food specials (how can you refuse to acknowledge happy hour??), by the time I left, I was still a fan.  My optimistic potential viewpoint is based on these 2 unique factors:\n\n1) amazing rooftop bar.  Seriously.  We were up there at about 8:30pm on a 102-degree day, and it was honestly comfortable!  I had been skeptical that we'd be able to make it, but between the misters and canvas \""retractable ceiling tiles,\"" it was a pleasant way to view an amazing sunset over Camelback and Squaw Peak.  This view is fantastic and I am glad that Del Frisco's is taking full advantage of it.  This rooftop is simply cool, and made me feel like I was in a real, proper city!\n2) complimentary valet.  But even better than just the complimentary valet right in front of the restaurant, the valet also has an option where you can text them 10 minutes before you're ready to go, and your car will be pulled up when you walk out.  This makes this place a very convenient place to meet up without having to deal with parking!\n\nThe cocktails and wine list were pretty standard, and we had a flatbread pizza that was really yummy.  But it was the rooftop bar and valet that will make me come back -- and next time, stay for dinner.",1.0,0.9992489218711852

Half off pitchers of sangria and mojitos. I am torn between a love-dislike relationship with Firefly. They tend to be inconsistent between the two other locations and that trend runs over to their new one in Anthem. The menu is still the same, the prices are unchanged, but they have down sized the portions. \n\nI came here with three other people and went crazy during their HH. For $14-$15 a pitcher, it is easy to order 6 between three. That's right folks, one must be sober enough to be the DD. Don't drink and drive. More importantly, do not drink Firefly's drinks and drive. They are lethal, yet taste like candy. \n\nOur server, Cole, was awesome. If the drinks were not enough to make this a regular hang out, coming and chilling in Cole's station made it so. He made it clear that if we needed anything to just ask. He has a gauge for how far he can push it and with our drunk group, he saw nothing was off limits. Spunk is welcomed.\n\nThe food was good, but everything is 1/3 smaller than the other locations. Being located in Anthem does allow them to get away with more. All the usual items are on the menu. Their mixed paella is delicious, but their is no crispy bottom to scrap up. \n\nThe view from the patio is gorgeous. If you have a small party, request it for a gander down Eastern and over to the Strip. Sitting in the back area will also allow for a nice view of the Strip. When the sun goes down and the stars come out... It is breathtaking.",1.0,0.9969111084938048

I don't remember his name, but he was dead behind the eyes and slightly creepy. And you have to be pretty creepy for me to think you're creepy. \n\nAll of their signature drinks were on special for happy hour, but every single one of them was some sugary concoction. Figured I'd play it safe and get a mojito... but they were out of mint. He asked if I still wanted one, clearly ignoring the fact that mint is what makes a mojito work so well. I got some blueberry lemonade thing (at my chick's insistence). It was so sweet my face puckered. \n\nTime for some appetizers! The cheese steak spring rolls sounded great... except that they're egg rolls, not spring rolls (learn the difference, guys!), and they consisted entirely of meat shoved into a fried egg roll. That was it. The picture they showed made them look delicious, what with all the cheese and steak and onions and gooey innards slowly oozing out. This... this was gross. Like, something AM/PM would serve gross. \n\nThe mac-and-cheese squares were ok. Too much breading. I want to taste the mac and cheese, not all the fried crap around it. I suppose if I'd been drunken these might've been better. Keep that in mind if you plan on stopping in here.",0.0,0.9959879517555236
