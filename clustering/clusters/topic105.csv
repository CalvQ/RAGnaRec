I ALWAYS look forward to going to Paradise Cafe. I have to go at least twice on every visit and sometimes hit the one up at the airport. I give this location a generous 3 star only because I love the restaurant as a whole. Almost every other Paradise I have been to has been 5 stars. Unfortunately this location was some what of a disappointment. I saw the site about a new smoothie B-green. I thought it would be a nice change. Well by the time I got to the end of the line to pay they bring me this drink that was grayish in color. They informed me that they had ran out of bananas (which is the base for the drink) and made it wi yogurt instead. I informed them that I was lactose intolerant and they ask if they could make me the same drink without the yogurt or a different smoothie. I asked what ones were dairy free and was told they all have yogurt. Umm ok I was thinking to myself why would they offer me something they know I can't have. I asked for a refund and that was that. \n\n  After sitting down I noticed that the staff was sweeping the store. I noticed that they had swept everything into a line in the middle of each walking area. It seemed that the lines of dirt and food crumbs were there for quite some time after sitting down. It was there long enough for me to eat my salad and have to look at filth swept into a pile. Finally the staff member came by with a dust mop and got all the dirt line in the store. Still sitting and eating after the sweeping was done I wondered why he even swept in the first place or if he did. There was still food, napkins and other things under most of the tables in my section. \n\nAgain don't get me wrong I love this chain.

It's sweet-tart in a refreshing way -- it does actually taste roughly the red-purple shade that it is -- as it's basically a fruit smoothie soft-serve. The five-ounce bowl comes with slices of banana, berries, and a sprinkling of granola that's useful for absorbing the last melted bits of soft-serve. In the relentless sun of suburban Tempe, it has the magic taste of feeling about five years younger, deeply wise and earnest (if not actually in touch with the spirit of yoga masters), and in need of flowing garments with fringes.\n\nWhen not a free offering, these are ungodly expensive. They're probably also little calorie bombs on the same scale as froyo.\n\nIf I were at this shopping center again, I'd have another on my own dime because Tempe is, for me, a vast beige suburban wasteland of dehydration that I need Calories of Refreshing Happiness to endure, and these calories are extremely refreshing and happy.

At least cut the straw so it's proportionate to the smoothie cup. \nIt's an okay place. Very nice ambience, and friendly service. I probably still won't be back.

My husband had to throw it out and pour his Caribbean breeze in there for her. Luckily, the cup was so small, that he still had about 2/3rd of his medium left.

I've driven past it before as its near my old work as well as one of the best Philly cheesesteaks in the valley (Forefathers), but just never got around to stopping in.\n\nThe one thing I really liked is that, as opposed to Jamba Juice, they ACTUALLY have food! Not just pretzels! They have sandwiches, flatbread & wraps, amongst other items. However, we ate a couple hours earlier so we just came for the smoothies. \n\nWe walked into your typical 'Hawaiian' ambiance, but at least it was clean and not OVERLY cheesy. The place was empty and we were instantly greeted as we walked in. The employee was very friendly and helpful. My wife got the Blue Lagoon and I got the Silky Peach (or something like that). Both were good, but I liked my wife's a little more. I didn't see if they had any 'free throw-ins' like they do at Jamba Juice, nor were we offered any, so I'm assuming they don't. They had some free samples of a peanut butter smoothie and flatbread sandwich on the counter, which we tried while we waited. Both were really good. \n\nI'll have to go back when I'm hungry to try the food, but the smoothies were definitely on-par to that of Jamba Juice.",1.0,0.9968816041946412

I also love the prepacked green juices and have tried the famous Acai bowls. \n\nThe product has been extremely inconsistent as of the last 3 months or so. The last 3 times I've been there the following occurred:\n\n1) Chunks of frozen banana (Popeye Acai)\n2) Chunks of some kind of tart/bitter powder (Popeye Acai)\n3) Pieces (lots) of pit from the Date Nut smoothie which rendered this smoothie un-drinkable unless I wanted to use a strainer. I'm assuming the hard rock like bits were pieces of pit.... \n \nThe last one was when I actually decided to call and tell them about what I've been experiencing. My hesitation was that I would call and the message would never make it to management... either way, I tried the phone number that came up on Google as well as the number listed directly on Yelp - first number seemed to be corporate office which was closed and the phone number to the store just didn't go through at all (was during store hours). Thus, I reluctantly resorted to Yelp. \n\nI love this product. Truly. And will be trying the North location from now. I will not return to Hilton Village.",0.0,0.988599419593811
