Was listed in the dining section for the hotels on the strip. And knowing Kerry Simon from his battle on Iron Chef America, off we went to give it a try.\n\nFirst off, the decor was pretty cool with \""1960's Russian propaganda posters and thematic fixtures\"". Very modern and hip feel. Our server was cool and fast. A few women servers were dressed in sexy military attire (wish one of them served us). haha.\n\nOn to the food. There's a nice selection of house special burgers and a \""build your own\"" section. I went and ordered a house item the Cobb Burger. Has bacon, blue cheese, avocado, tomato salsa, red pepper mayo and a sesame brioche bun.\n\nOnce i got it....i was like...hmm. The burger was put together kinda sloppy and i wasn't diggin' the basket presentation. I cut the burger in half to see the layers of all the \""goodness\"". Still wasn't looking \""wow\"". My medium ordered cooked meat looked more like less than medium-rare. So after the visuals i decided to go ahead and take a bite...\n\nOh... this is pretty good. I wish it was cooked to medium, but  i got the flavor of the bacon and blue cheese and the mayo. the areas where the meat was cooked to my liking was tasty and flavorful. I liked the chopped bacon which is a change from other burgers that have slices. The bun was good, but for some reason it was really filling, And the fries were just ok.\n\nOverall, it was good, It wasn't \""wow\"" and a few disappointments. But I'd give this place a try again. Maybe pair a vodka with a burger. hmmm?\n\nI know people complain of prices, but heck. it's Vegas and it's a famous chef's restaurant. Live it up. ;)\n\nThanks!",1.0,0.996526300907135

For a burger place marketed so heavily on a Russian theme, I was disappointed in the lack of Glasnost and correlation in not having any actual food there that had any Russian influence or ingredients.  It's kind of amusing that the very nature of having a burger bar in a hotel casino in Vegas from a celebrity chef is in itself, bourgeoisie though, so I'm sure they weren't really striving for authenticity here.  Anyways, you definitely get to Perestroika your burger in general,  with multiple options of topping and type of burger meat, if the pre-set burger options don't appeal to your proletariat tastes.  \n\nThe burger I had was the Thanksgiving burger, it came out juicy, very flavorful, and was a very large portion.  The Captain Crunch shake I had was also delicious (yes, there are actual blended bits of Captain Crunch inside!).  Prices are typical for the inside of a hotel casino on the Strip- overpriced.  They will also charge you for a take out box, which loses some points in my opinion.  \n\nSo, despite the lack of influence from Mother Russia other than the skimpy Russian guard uniforms and slightly Communist-era propaganda art/spy themed art on the walls, KGB is a good place to get a burger and shake...... if you're willing to part with your hard earned Rubles, that is...",1.0,0.9260851740837096

After making our order the courses came out very well timed and Melissa was  always available.\n\nFor two people with the tasting menu and drinks you can expect a high bill, but it is well worth it.  This is a restaurant that I would frequent often if I lived in Las Vegas.",1.0,0.9998348951339722

Don't let it keep you away.  The food is solid and the vodka selection, one of the largest in Vegas.\n\nThe menu is authentic Russian.  Western dishes such as smoked salmon atop won ton chips with wasabi cream and tobiko (very refreshing and delicious) sit next to a classic steak tartare.\n\nStick to the old school classics.  The seared foie with baked apples served on French toast with a warm, apple butter and huckleberry gastrique and garnished by  smoky, oily bacon is sublime.  The traditional steak tartare is near perfect.  Super clean flavor of the chilled beef spicy mustard, salty capers, pungent onions, oceanic anchovies and creamy raw egg yolk beautifully presented (they can mix it for you if you are not comfortable doing it yourself).  All served atop melba toast and a side of cr\u00e8me friache.  \n\nFor mains, its gotta be the stroganoff made with filet mignon tips.  Warm, comforting, stick to the ribs goodness, the way a stroganoff should be.  Incredible earthiness from the mushrooms.\n\nHuge selection of vodka from around the world from the great classics to the nouveau silly (bubble gum or Fruit Loops).  All can be ordered as 2 oz, 3 oz, or even full bottles if you want the true drunken experience.  Prices are very high (Vegas ultra lounge / club)\n\nThe lounge gets crowded and very loud.  It fuels the gregarious spirit in the more plush and private dining room.",1.0,0.9994649291038512

What's not to like here. Be sure to take a minute and look at their Russian decor and vodka display.\n\n I enjoyed the BBQ bacon burger with their homemade smoky flavored BBQ sauce, Gouda cheese, bacon, and onion straws. I had a side of tots which aren't anything special but really who can pass up any chance to try tater tots? Between the burger and tots I was too full to try one of their shakes but hopefully next time.\n\nIt's a vodka bar so you have to try one of their cocktails. They cost a few rubles but welcome to Vegas. The Double Agent is a peach/melon flavored drink which was very enjoyable.\n\nI'll come back here and hopefully try a milkshake.",1.0,0.9979999661445618

So here's another place. I like the name, Dacha is Russian for \""Summer Home\"", which I've always had fond memories of when I was a kid growing up in Russia. The outside actually looks like a Dacha, which was pretty intriguing. Problem was that the inside looked like a Russian Dance Hall.. Loud music, Hookah, strange d\u00e9cor, not the best first impression. \nThe food was good. Olivie is something you can judge a Russian Restaurant by and theirs was great and it was a very nice portion. \nThey were out of the pickled Herring, which was a little disappointing. \nRassolnik was well balanced and tasty. Zharkoe was good too, haven't seen this dish on too many Russian menus, despite being a common Russian dish. \nOverall the food was authentic and the prices were reasonable. I want to come back and try the Piroshki and the Borsht, both of which are a good barometer for Russian Food. The service is not bad and I like addition of classic Russian Cartoons on the big screen. \nI am a little confused about the some of the reviews, which look about as fake as  Watches sold near the Red Square. Grammar mistakes obviously written by the same person. A little distasteful, so I am docking a star for that, even though it's a little funny. Overall, I would totally recommend coming to this place and trying the food. If you  are or have ever been interested in trying Russian food, this place will give you a good idea of what it's all about.",1.0,0.9761242866516112
