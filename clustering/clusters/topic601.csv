They had these pictures that were framed of these hilarious scenes of drunken olives and all kinds of stuff... and, true to goth culture, Betty Page.\n\nI wandered around... my psychic magnetism tends to draw me to sales... and I found these insanely cute t-shirts... one for $8 and the other for $12!!  I was so excited.  Bring that crap on.\n\nI even found David and Goliath shirts... they were actually selling the shirt I purchased at the store in the Venetian in Vegas!!  (the Spooning Leads To Forking shirt... it's flipping awesome.  Every time I wear it I get a compliment.)  They had a number of other shirts by that company... very funny catch phrases, like Ms. Lush, showing a picture of a drunken cartoon girl with pigtails. LOL\n\nI was overall pleased with this place.

In some ways it is. But it does offer something a little different. It is a jewellery shop selling genuine Scottish made jewellery. And some of these trinkets are indeed quite nice. Keep in mind that its Scottish focus is quite narrow. This tends to mean neo-Celtic design and maybe some Mackintosh. Don't start your career in Scottish art and design history here.\n\nSo The Luckenbooth though first appearing like all the others, does offer something a bit different, more niche. Or so its seems.

Bracelets, rings and kilt pins are among the other items which The Luckenbooth sell, which are all incredibly reasonably priced. The jewellery doesn't really appeal to me, perhaps because I am Scottish, but it always appears to go down well with the tourists. \n\nIf you ever want to buy traditional Scottish jewellery, The Luckenbooth is the place to go.",1.0,0.9981368780136108
