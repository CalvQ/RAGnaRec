My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\n\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!",1.0,0.961402952671051

My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.\n\nThe tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.\n\nWhat a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!",1.0,0.9998063445091248

The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there.",0.0,0.5440012216567993

The service was great! Our waiter even split the check...what? 25 different ways - that was awesome! The space they put us in was cozy and well lit. My food tasted great! I had their Brie, Marinated Artichoke, and Smoked Salmon (yes, I actually ordered fish!) Bruschetta; each had it's own flavor and textures and I liked them all, although I liked the Brie best.\n\nIt was an interesting venue for a Bridal Shower, at times I think our group was a little too loud for the surrounding tables, and when the bride-to-be started opening her gifts...well, it's a family restaurant so I think everyone was a little embarrassed bystanders and invitees/gift-givers alike.\n\nNext time I come I will order an entire meal, this place was great.",1.0,0.9996287822723388

The food & the atmosphere will not be enough to make me come back.
