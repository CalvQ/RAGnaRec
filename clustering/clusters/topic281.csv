I ordered my garage door at Home Depot and this is the company they contract with. Everything started out ok...they came out 2 days after I placed the order to measure and check out the site. We are converting our carport to a garage and the door ordered was a 10wx7h. I was told that the door would be in the week of Thanksgiving. Stapley finally called me last week to say the door would be in on Dec 11. So we scheduled Dec 13 for the installation. On Dec 12 at 2:30 in the afternoon I get a call saying they ordered a 10x6'9\"" door instead of the 10x7 and they would need to install a new header. I didn't know that garage door installers are also framers...hmmmm.  Since this was their mistake I requested they install my opener for free. I was told they could do one or the other not both. So it was my choice...have them install a new header to correct their mistake in ordering a door that was 3\"" shorter WITHOUT telling me in advance or install my garage door opener. I should mention if I choose the opener they would need to schedule a time to come back they cant do it all in one day!! Are you kidding me???  I chose to have them install the opener, and they said they would be here to install the door this morning 12/13/13 at 8am. When I called them at 9:10 no one answered, so I left a message. I called them back at 9:30 and was told the installer would be here in about 30 minutes someone added another job on his schedule..but not the scheduler.  I will never recommend this company to anyone. They completely dropped the ball on this and are not very willing to make things right. They should correct what they screwed up and install the opener.....poor customer service.\n\n\nI waited to update my review hoping things would change....my opinion of this company has not changed at all.  I should say that the very professional installer finally showed up at 10:40 and left at 1:00. That is a lot of work for 1 guy. You would think they would have 2 guys on each door and then they would be closer to on time!\n\nIt is now 12/28 and my garage door opener is still not installed.

The other places were way over priced and would charge me $50 just to look at it (oh but they'd waive that if I overpaid and had them fix my door) or we're unavailable until this evening. So glad I called HNS. Gave me a quote over the phone, got a call back within an hour, showed up and we're very professional. They looked at my door, which I backed into, dented and knocked off the track, and fixed it on the spot. If i do decide to replace the panel I would definitely use HNS. Being 9 months pregnant and at a loss for where to turn for a trustworthy repair service, they put my mind at ease!",1.0,0.9617973566055298

He did great, fast, quality work for a very fair price. I highly recommend Travis and will do work with him in the future.",1.0,0.998779594898224
