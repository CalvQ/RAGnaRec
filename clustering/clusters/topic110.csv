We always grab some egg rolls too. The lady on the phone wasn't rude, per se, but she wasn't exactly helpful or answering any of my questions, either (hubby wanted to see about getting a different sauce on his noodles, and I had to ask a few times before she finally answered my question about how large the tofu dish was). I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food.\n\nThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls.\n\nSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great. If you're looking for a quick fix to your Chinese food craving, this is a good place to order from, although I'll be going back to Uncle Chen before I try China Sea again.",1.0,0.984421968460083

On our first visit I ordered the mandarin beef noodle soup. While the beef and tendons were well-cooked and tasty, I did not like the soup as much; it was more like marinade/braising sauce than beef broth. Some may argue that this is common in beef noodle soup, but being from Taiwan (a place where beef noodle soup is extremely popular) I'm not a huge fan of this type of soup. All-in-all I still enjoyed the dish, the beef chunks and tendons were nice.\n\nThe seafood pho my mom ordered was also plain, although my mom liked it. \n\nOn our second visit I had the Dan Dan noodles while my mother ordered the Hainanese chicken rice and a side of Shu Mai. While I'm not an expert at either of the main dishes, I quite enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles; they reminded me of tasty dry noodles with sauce that I used to have as a kid living in Taipei. I would have preferred if there was more soup; the noodles were really taking up the small bowl and sucking up most of the soup.\n\n The chicken rice, on the other hand was not so good. The rice itself was dry, and everything else about the dish was mediocre. The Shu Mai were dry and average-tasting as well.\n\nStill, Noodles isn't all that bad for a quick bite of Asian food; it gets the job done.\n\nTaking into consideration that the type of food Noodles serves is - to my knowledge - quite rare in Vegas, it might deserve a 3.5.",0.0,0.82289057970047

I admire the owners for taking a risk and opening this place in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic food to the masses. \n\nThat being said, the food isn't spectacular. The first time my husband and I went there, it was at dinnertime and we thought the food was decent. The Crispy Honey Chicken ($7.95) was a bit too sweet and not as crispy as one would hope, but the Mongolian Beef ($9.50) was tender and pretty flavorful. We also had the Crab Puffs for $4.95, which were fine but no better than the ones at Panda Express. The prices were low, service good, and overall, it was an ok dining experience. However, when we returned for lunch today, we were a bit disappointed. Having enjoyed a beef dish during the last visit, I decided to try the Volcano Beef lunch special. My husband got the General Tso chicken. Their website says lunch specials are $4.95, but I believe they were $5.50 each. The chicken was ok, but again, it wasn't that crispy. Sesame Chicken, General Tso Chicken, and other similar dishes are only really good if the outside is very crispy and the sauce adds flavor not sogginess. The sauce that came with the beef was spicy and flavorful and the accompanying veggies (carrot, mushrooms, broccoli, and bok choy) were really fresh, but the beef itself was really bad quality. On the upside, the egg roll that came with both lunch specials was really good. The filling was savory, and it almost tasted like it was fried in butter! \n\nI am certainly glad that the owners of Sun Asian Kitchen brought Chinese food to South Phoenix, but I hope that many more Asian restaurateurs follow suit and open restaurants in this area, so that Kristin, Sunny, and I have more options to choose from!

We were gonna only have some noodles, but we couldn't resist ordering some entrees.  We had Hong Kong style chow mein with Chinese broccolli and pork, deep fried tofu, Chinese beef stew with turnips, and an order of Steamed chicken with ginger sauce.  The chicken was only mediocre, but everything else was very good.  The deep friend tofu is pretty simple -- just small pieces of tofu rolled in corn starch and deep fried.  But I love tofu so this dish is really comfort food for me.  My wife loves noodles, especially Hong Kong style noodles -- but of course, our favorite noodle style is \""Hawaiian cake noodle\""  -- on available in Hawaii or Hawaiian-style Chinese restaurants.  \n\nThis style of noodles came about due to a cooking error many years ago.  A restuarant in Hawaii was boiling noodles for some soup noodle dish and overcooked the noodles -- they came out overcooked and squooshy.  Not wanting to waste the noodles, they put oil in a pan and fried the noodles until one side was crispy and then they flipped it over and fried the other side until crispy.  This way, the outside of the \""noodle cake\"" is crispy and brown, but the insides are soft and chewy.  These days the technique has been perfected such that when the overcooked noodles are removed from the pot, they are drained but not rinsed -- this keep as much starch on the noodle and when fried, the starch makes the noodle stick together -- try making it at home.  It is delish!! Put your favorite Chinese noodle toppings on it, especially if it has a little bit of gravy with it.",0.0,0.7866448760032654

They have a cooler with canned sodas in it. It really irks me when restaurants do this and always brings questions to mind like: (1) You can afford to run a restaurant but can't afford a soda machine? (2) If I wanted a canned soda, I'd just drink that at home... or in THIS place's case, just (literally) walk to the pharmacy 10 feet away and buy one for cheaper...\n\nOK, back to the potato beef. I ordered this hoping it would be \""stew-like\""... like the filipinos make which is one of my favorite dishes... IT WAS NOT... This was more like Mongolian (style) beef with some potato slices thrown in... the potatoes were cut crinkle/zucchini style... cheap flavors and nothing to write home about.\n\nThe free spring roll that came with it was probably that pre-made crap from the grocery store... which I'm beginning to suspect ALL their ingredients come from the Wal-Mart or Smith's nearby. I suspect this because this place is right next to a cool butcher shop... but when I asked the manager if they got their meat from the butcher next door, he said \""No, we get it from another store\"".... he specifically said STORE... not a meat packaging or distribution place like the GOOD Chinese restaurants do.\n\nThe free appetizer with the lunch special was \""corn egg soup\""... they literally called it that... I've always heard it called egg drop soup... this one was pretty bland with no green onions added... and it seemed to be much thicker than what other Chinese restaurants have.\n\nOverall, the entire meal was BLAND... despite how cheap it is, I would suggest someone go to Panda Express if they're looking to go the cheap route... but if you want some REALLY TASTY Chinese food... in bigger portions... check out China-A-Go-Go (multiple locations) or China Tango Bistro (in Green Valley)",0.0,0.9989318251609802

We were on our way to Yu's Chinese Express but made a detour since a friend had mentioned this place, not to mention it had four stars on Yelp.\n\nWe go in, get seated, and after reading through the menu we are excited. Lots of traditional Chinese dishes, some of which we haven't had in a long time, so our hopes were high.\n\nFirst thing we ordered was the hot and sour soup. A steal at $3.50 for a small portion, which was enough to feed 3-4. Unfortunately, it was neither hot (spicy) nor sour. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't live up to its name.\n\nBesides the soup, we ordered the House Special Lo Mein, Sizzling Hot Plate Beef, Szechuan Green Beans, and Yui Shan Eggplant. We were expecting a feast, but was severely disappointed.\n\nThe Sizzling Hot Plate Beef arrived first. Interestingly enough, the beef was on a regular plate (not sizzling), which the waitress then dumped on to a hot plate (sizzled maybe just a bit). Then, she put a spoonful of what looked like rice wine over the dish, then attempted to set it on fire. That was a big FAIL, and then she tried to do it again, without success. We basically ended up with a non sizzling plate of beef that was drenched with rice wine. The Szechuan Green Beans were next, but it had a sweet taste to it. This was definitely another first...normally they are supposed to be salty and a bit spicy. The Yui Shan Eggplant was alright, which was probably the best part of the meal just above the white rice.\n\nThe kicker of course, was the House Special Lo Mein. When we ordered it the waitress made sure that we wanted crunchy noodles (cake noodle, or so we thought) and not soft noodles. We said yes, we want crunchy noodles. What we got was a plate of vegetables and meat with a side of fried won ton strips. Seriously? Normally I would've taken a few pictures, but I think I was in so much shock it didn't register in my head. \n\nWhile the service wasn't bad (drinks refilled consistently) the food was blasphemous.

Not the best we've had, but not the worst either.  The hot and sour soup tasted so watered down!  Maybe if it had another few hours to reduce it might have tasted better. The spicy chicken dish, which was recommended by our waitress, was straight up nasty! Unedible.  It was little bits of breaded chicken that were fried and tossed with a mound of red chilis.  Oddly though, the chicken itself was not spicy.  My fianc\u00e9 and I literally tried one piece each and did not touch it after that! It tasted like cardboard and I am not exageratting!  Needless to say, we had a ton of leftovers that we did not take home with us! \nThere was nothing wrong with the service we got, it's just the food that was the problem!  We left there feeling pretty nasty from all the sodium, grease and fat we consumed and we didn't even eat that much!  Yuck, I will not be going back!",0.0,0.8477054238319397

I do know the onions were fresh. The shrimp were cooked well as they were tender and tasted like shrimp, the sauce although a bit orange in color was tasty with a nice heat to it. I chose the fried rice which was a very light fry. It was fine. The egg roll was pretty good as was the crab puff and I do not like crab puffs, but this one has actual filling in it.

That being said, I ordered delivery of \""pork chow mein\"" and received \""pork fried rice\"".  I called to report the error and they said if I wanted the chow mein they'd send it right out but I'd have to return the \""pork fried rice\"".  We found this little bit annoying because the rest of our food had arrived and was still hot and we wanted to get started, but we had to then wait 30 mins for the chow mein to arrive and make the exchange, at which point the rest of the food was cold.  \n\nWhen the replacement did arrive, it was not \""pork chow mein\"" but \""pork chop suey\"".  I called back again to let her know of the 2nd mistake, this time they said keep the chop suey and they'd credit a pork chow mein to my name/number for next time.  In their defense, the pork chop suey was quite tasty, as was the wonton soup and chicken we ordered, so it wasn't really that huge a let down in the long run. \n\nA few weeks later I decided to cash in on the replacement pork chow mein, and also decided to order more of their (admittedly DELICICOUS) wonton soup and some chicken balls.  Even though they have both \""Chicken Balls\"" and \""Pineapple chicken\"" on their menu on seperate lines, and at seperate prices, the order taker informs me that \""chicken balls\"" are the same as \""pineapple chicken\"".  Okay fine, I'll take whatever y ou wanna call it as long as it's the balls in the red sauce junk food that I'm craving right now.  \n\nAlthough it was just standard red sauce and chicken balls, they were great, but \""pineapple chicken\"" they were not.... and the \""pork chow mein\"" they were supposed to send?  It was \""pork chop suey\"" yet again.  I didn't bother calling to correct it this time.  The food was decent and the price is reasonable.

And what with the hangover & food cravings that was a bonus! Then the main courses were brought out: sweet & sour chicken Cantonese style, Singapore noodles, boiled rice. \n\nThe chicken in pink sauce was only relatively nice due to the fact that the noodles didn't taste of anything apart from a hint of cleaning fluid & a fair kick of spice. I only ate half the noodles, & only ate that much because of the aforementioned hankering; also i had to steal pink sauce from the chicken to make them palatable! \n\nMy partner ate all her chicken, but most of the rice was left, due to the fact that there wasn't enough pink sauce to flavour all her rice AND all of my noodles! There were 3 other tables in when we arrived, but eventually they left one by one, leaving us the only couple in there, the only people for them to wait on/ stare at! We spent quite a bit of time discussing all the positives of the restaurant (I liked the trap door in the floor, my partner liked the blinds, I liked the plastic flowers, she liked the hand dryer in the toilet, we both liked the water..!) as well as laughing at the sheer awkwardness of the situation (awkward turtle!) There was also discussion about how terribly British we both were in that we weren't able to complain and send the food back! As we asked for the bill I decided that since I was intending to write a review on here, I should at least let them know in person that the meal had been a little disappointing to give them the opportunity to do something about it.

The color of an authentic wonton noodle soup should be in brown color since one of the main ingredient is a sun dried fish call \""Big Land Fish\"" in Chinese, and before the fish was put into the soup, it must be charcoal broiled until it was dark and burned. That's why an authentic wonton soup base is always in brown color. From the first sip of this light color soup base I know i won't go back to BBQ King on my next trip to Vegas. The soup tasted like the only ingredient  there was chicken flavor powder and the noodle was completely different than before. They still show the sign that said the noodle was air shipped from HK. What a Lie!!! \n\nWonton noodle soup is a very common dish but it is very complicated to perfected it. I guess beside HK and Canada, there is no place offer authentic wonton noodle soup in the states.",0.0,0.9869743585586548

When I first tried the Braised beef noodle, it was actually OK.  My wife and I decided to go back for lunch the next day.  I ordered the same noodle - was disappointed because they made such a big deal about my request for egg noodle (which is what I ordered the day before).  They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.  To top it off, they were not consistent with the flavor.  Should have gone to Noodles at Bellagio.",0.0,0.9994194507598876

The place was jumping, and we had to wait a few minutes. While waiting, we watched one of the chefs expertly making hand-made noodles. We were excited to eat hand-made noodles.\n\nUnfortunately, the food did not live up to the anticipation. The noodles were overpriced and small in portion, compared to what you would get in Chinatown.  I had the Lan Zhou noodle. I lived in Monterey Park, CA, for a number of years and was used to high quality Chinese noodle dishes. The handmade noodle at Beijing No. 9 tasted good and was properly cooked. However, the broth it was swimming in was weak and lacked punch, and perhaps cooked to appeal to broader tastes. \n\nMy partner had a noodle salad dish that was overpowered by Hoisin sauce and ruined by tough tiny chunks of beef that resembled cat food. The Lan Zhou noodle came with thin meager slices of beef that was quite flavorful. We shared the Hainanese chicken dish. I've had this dish in Southeast Asia, and it is one of my favorite chicken and rice dishes. At Beijing No. 9, the rice was dry, the chicken slices were pathetically nonexistent and bony (and did not include the breast meat with skin), and they did not serve the dish with a side of chicken broth like other restaurants do. Awful dish for about twenty dollars.\n\nWe went to this restaurant because it was highly recommended and they received rave reviews from Bon Appetit. We would not have minded paying the higher prices if the dishes had been remotely good. However, only go here if you're trapped at Caesar's and can't get to Chinatown. If you can get off the strip, go to the myriad noodle places and Chinese restaurants in Chinatown for superb noodles at less than half the price they charge at Caesar's. \n\nFinally, I'm wondering how wise it is to put so many goldfish in the tanks; they seemed to have no space to move around.

I just moved here a few months ago and wanted to compare it to places back home. I'm giving a solid 3 stars.\n\nThis is probably the largest Chinese buffet I've been to. You pay upfront, so our lunch for 2 cost just over $22 with drinks, not including tip. Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks). \n\n\nMy favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\n\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \n\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \n\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine. \n\nI rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills.

A cool noodle dish that is very awesome on a hot day!\nThe Mi Xao Don - Crispy Egg Noodle - fold the edges in - and wait for the sauce to soak up the noodles. They become soft and have a crispy/fried taste while being soft and easier to eat.\nLast, but not least, their Pho. It is top notch. Ask for them to keep the raw beef on the side when you order so you can let it cook yourself. Otherwise it can come out a little too cooked, and not rare anymore. I think they probably do that to accommodate Caucasian patrons, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nTry this place. I drive over from Middleton at least a month just for dumplings.

From the yelp reviews I knew I had to try it on my recent trip to Montreal.  I went there with dumplings on my mind and nothing else.  Almost as soon as we sat down a pot of tea appeared.  A nice thing, espeically since the other \""dumpling\"" place we went to (see my review of Mai Xiang Yuan) didn't even have it as an option!  \n\nWe got the shrimp, cabbage and egg dumplings steamed and the pork and cabbage ones pan fried.  Both were good.  But again a bit of a different style than I typically have gotten or made.  They are like wanna be soup dumplings.  But not really enough to be soup, more like a big squirt of broth.  Good, and tricky not to get on you, but not the same as soup dumplings I've had in other places.  I'm starting to think of this as the \""montreal\"" style of dumplings.  The pork ones were pretty good, although they could have used another 1 minute to really give them a good texture.  The steamed ones were fine, but I really didn't get any egg in mine and the dough had a bit more \""bite\"" to in than I typically expect.  Although the thickness was good.  \n\nOne cool thing is they will sell you frozen dumplings to take home.  A great idea!  Rather buy these than the machine produced ones in a bag with mystery meat.  \n\nPrices are good, but didn't try anything else other than the dumplings.  The chili oil was very good and I highly recommended using it.  Not blazing hot, just a slight tingle to the outside of your lips but a great flavor.  My solution to the squirting dumpling syndrome?  Just pop the whole thing in your mouth and bit letting the juice flood your mouth instead of squirting out onto your shirt.",1.0,0.9791695475578308

I come here for one thing and one thing only--their best seller, Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup.\n\nThe noodles are usually cooked soft with just a bit of bite. If it were up to me, I would prefer them a little more chewy. But the broth has a light to medium body and is packed full of flavor and I can honestly say that the broth alone makes up for a limp noodle. On top of it all, the braised beef and tendon are always tender and delicious. And it's all served with a healthy serving of fresh and pickled vegetables. After trying a few other noodle dishes here, I came to the conclusion I don't like any of it. But if I'm feeling frisky, I'll mix in a Beef Roll with my noodle soup. Noodle Pot's beef roll is a popular Taiwanese finger food. Scallion, cilantro, sweet/savory hoisin sauce, and tender chunks of beef shank are rolled in a slightly chewy pancake. At first glance, I would compare it to a crepe-like burrito. I suggest digging in with your hands and dipping in a bit of black vinegar. Delicious!\n\nDecor is your typical no-frills, family-owned, Asian hole-in-the-wall. Nothing fancy, but always clean. Their English isn't the best either so if you don't know your basic Chinese just point at the number you want. All in all, service is friendly enough to make this a quick stop for a bite to eat. Just make sure you remember this place is CASH ONLY! If you forget, buy some gum at 99 Ranch Market and get cash back. (Been there done that).",1.0,0.9938867688179016

The noodles and tendon were soft, very tender and perfectly cooked. I would come back just for this soup alone.\n\nThe wontons in chili oil ($6.50) was also an impressive dish, and it too was served the traditional way.

I'm not too sure if they'll be a next time....\n\nThe guy behind the counter was nice and they were accommodating in reguards to the request of white chicken and if my daughter can eat her slice of pizza inside but the food just wasn't what we remembered enjoying like at the Anthem location and my fortune inside my fortune cookie was freaky- it just said \""Learn Chinese\"".....

But my last two visits have been just average, bordering on not very good.\n\nMy first trip I had the Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup (on the restaurant menu as Special House Soup) and it was amazing!  The flavor was rich and flavorful, every bite was in perfect balance.  I followed that up with the Beijing Zha Jiang Mein with Noodles (again it has a different name on the restaurant menu).  These were good, amazingly flavorful but served colder than I would expect.  Still the end result was I was telling everyone about the great Chinese restaurant I found and counting the days till I could go back and sample some more dishes.\n\nMy second trip I made the mistake of ordering some of the \""Americanized Chinese\"" dishes.  The hot and sour soup tasted like Apple Cider Vinegar (not good), the General Tso's chicken tasted funky (in a bad way) and the fried rice was bland.  The Orange Chicken was surprisingly light and tasty.  These were a let down, but I had read other people's reviews so I backed up the order with another Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup and a Schezuan Eggplants with Knife cut noodles.  This time the soup was too salty, too oily, and completely out of balance, plus the noodles weren't fully cooked.  The Schezuan Eggplant had tomato in it (which might have been okay if they were cooked but they were cold) and the noodles were doughy and raw in places.\n\nSo I went a third time, hoping that the last visit was just a fluke.  Unfortunately, it was again just meh.  The Homemade Tofu with noodles had amazing tofu with bland undercooked noodles.  And the Beijin Wonton Noodle Soup had a beautiful aroma but the broth was lackluster, bordering on bland and the wontons were also nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service here is great, the family that owns it friendly, and they are about 3 minutes from my house.  So I'll probably end up going back again.  But in the meantime, I'm no longer singing their praises.

I was impressed with the noodle selection - but actually have not had great experiences with the noodles in takeout form.  Once the drunken noodles were absolutely horrible - but that was my own ordering trouble as I ordered a 5 spice with ghost sauce when I really wanted a 3 spice.  The confusion stems from our other favorite Thai place downtown which is on a 1-10 scale.  Anyway, I digress.  \n\nRather than delivery, today I went in to Le Thai and my whole world changed.  It is so cute, great cantina feel up front and a patio in the back with fabulous ambiance.  Backyard chic between 2 brick walls in the middle of downtown.  It is fully private from passerby's (so no visitors begging for food or money) with a bamboo roof that lets just enough sun in and misters that are perfectly placed.  It was 100 degrees out today with raunchy humidity and I was totally comfortable.  We even stayed and chatted for a LONG time.  \n\nAnd lastly the food.  I think I actually enjoyed the food more going there.  I'd like to try the drunken &/or awesome noodles again while at Le Thai - I have convinced myself I will like them more.  Today I had Ginger fried rice with shrimp at a level 3 spice and it was very good.  Spice was just enough to make my mouth tingle but not quite \""clear your sinus cavity\"" hot.  \n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  So glad we went after the lunch rush because it was so great to sit and talk in this quaint place.   Oh and I went with a couple of very, very ANAL coworkers who both approved of the cleanliness of the kitchen.  I will definitely go back.

Again, the noodles were so SALTY! I thought my taste buds were too sensitive, so I asked my husband to try the noodles. He thought the noodles were too salty too. The ingredients were nothing to write home about; minced chicken with some veggies. I was so disappointed. If this wasn't a take out, I would have returned it and gave my comment to the chef. \n\nMy husband's Lunch Special Green Curry was ok.

When I try a new Oriental restaurant - I judge it based on the same three things - their House Lo-Mein or House Chow-Main, their Egg Rolls and/or Spring Rolls and their Chicken Wings. I also eat in, which if you truly want to judge a location eat in first, don't run home with your food.\n\nWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:\n\nCleanliness - I was there at 5:20pm, none of the tables had been wiped down. The person who sits there (if lucky) throws away their trays, etc. when they are done. But it was obvious no one comes along and periodically cleans the tables.\n\nChicken Wings - not sure why the Orientals cannot make a decent chicken wing, but this place wins the prize for being the most nasty wings I have ever had. If you love grease and no taste you will probably give these 5 stars.\n\nChicken Egg Rolls / Vegi Spring Rolls - frozen and fried, mush inside (had both), though the Spring Rolls had a slight better taste than the Egg Rolls, I would not order either ever again. Grease and mush in a crispy shell is best how describe both.\n\nWHAT I DID LIKE: \n\nPORTION - I will agree with everyone here, the portions are huge and I was not disappointed there for the price. In a pinch I would go back and order a main course, just nothing else. Also don't get hung up on \""Lo-Mein\"" vs \""Chow-Mein\"" unless you have a clue what both really mean. Both can come as a soft noodle.\n\nPRICE - Good\n\n(Main Dish) TASTE - I enjoyed the flavor of the House Chow-Mein and while not the best I have had in town, it was really good and I would have it again.\n\nSo three stars - for price, main dish taste and portions. Stop there with your order and it probably will not disappoint. \n\nFor the person who said that this is the best place in the West Valley, please get out more, this is obviously the only place you have been. For those that compare authentic Oriental Restaurants to Panda Express, please get cultured - don't disgrace the Orientals that way.",1.0,0.8540413975715637

After giving me a rather serious 'don't mess with me' look, he proceed to yank the sh*t out of the noodles, then slammed the hell out of them. Repeatedly.

It was tender and seemed fresh. I had to forgo the Bok Choy because no amount of cutting (or attempts at) seemed to work. I just couldn't chop through the damn leaves. They were so pretty and green, too. Anyway, I then got a taste of the noodles in sesame sauce. The sauce was  quite nice but tasted more like the peanut sauce you would find with peanut butter dumplings. The noodles were good though I did find them to be a bit on the starchy side. Also, they really should cut these things in half so I can get them on my fork more easily. The overall dish was very good, though I will hold that 4th star for a retry - this time in soup format, as the noodles are meant to be eaten.\n\nService: This is where I docked a star.

Sadly, not so much.\n\nAfter fighting a cold for the last couple of weeks, seeing check-in's for Shaanxi Gourmet coupled with mentions of an epic \""lamb with noodle\"" soup as well as appetizing photos drew me to arrive at said restaurant for dinner on a Saturday night around six.  Shaanxi specializes in the titular region of Chinese known for pork and lamb meat.  That's fantastic - I'm a big fan of both, particularly lamb.  \n\nI read up on the reviews and understood that this was hole-in-the-wall drab decor with friendly service and great food that had rather blah decor and sometimes required paging the staff for refills.  Okay, that's manageable.  \n\nHowever.  The server couldn't understand ANY English.  I had to point at what I wanted.  I had to point at a pot of tea to show I wanted hot tea.  I asked for another serving of soup, he brought a bowl.  Beyond the language barrier, our server forgot half of our order!  I had to remind him after chasing him down for another menu to point at this.  I eat at a lot of foreign restaurants that I can get past the language barrier but it was poor, overwhelmed service coupled with a lack of comprehension.  \n\nThe epic soup?  Completely devoid of any and all flavor.  Even ramen and pho that has strong condiments at the table to flavor the soup to your liking has a strong flavor to begin with that is only complimented by the table fixings.  This was just... beyond me.  Super thick noodles and giant chunks of lamb, awesome.  Flavorless soup?  Bland?!  I was so just disappointed with all of this.  The lamb skewers were tiny for what I expected and slightly over-seasoned.  \n\nSo frustrating.  And 25 dollar credit card minimum?  Forget this place.",0.0,0.9972376823425292

I had to add a bit of chili oil and dumpling sauce to it. \n\nPork vegetable wontons - 8 wontons on top of spicy bean thread noodles. Pretty good and filling for only $6.\n\nOnion pancake with beef - we really liked the flavors and it didn't feel as greasy as some other places. Good amount of crunch to the wrap.\n\nPork belly sliders - a bit disappointing, the pork looked good but all I could taste was the pickled vegetable filling. I was hoping for more of a duck flavored sauce inside, it would have helped with the dryness. The bun is huge, but again disappointing as it was dry and way too bland, missing a little sweetness.\n\nMilk tea with boba - I added mango pudding  and red bean to it.

Judy Dench still at the top of her game, and Everyday Noodles afterwards.\nThey have been since March, but it has taken us a while to get there. Not sure why we waited so long. \nThe place is a perfect translation of a contemporary noodle shop in Beijing (with some Taiwanese bubble-tea tossed in on the side) to Pittsburgh. Clean, sharp design, open kitchen, fragrant clouds wafting out from the stacked up steamers.\nIt was a very cold night, and we wanted warm and savory. On the menu, Item #42 was Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. This sounded like one of my favorite Beijing home preparations, Zha jiang mian. I asked our waitress whether this was the dish I was looking for, and, despite my awful pronunciation, she confirmed that it was. It came in minutes and we dug in with gusto. Deep, savory, slightly sweet, a firm foundation based on bean sauce, braised pork and just enough fish stock to deepen the flavor. Slivered cucumbers to balance, and, a surprise, a sprinkling of edamame--a great touch. All over broad wheat noodles. A great start, along with green tea courtesy of Forte.\nThis was a fine beginning, and we decided to finish things off with a scallion pancake, or as the menu describes it #34, Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake. Wow!!; the best I've had since Jinan in Shandong Province, just down the Yellow River from Beijing. Crispy and flaky on the outside, pillowy soft inside, sweet and pungent scallions, piping hot . . . a 10 of 10.\nSo, if you want the best of straight-on Beijing cooking, and don't have 24 hours for a flight to the East, head to Squirrel Hill and Everyday Noodles!",1.0,0.9953376054763794

I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was a HUGE portion! Tender chunks of beef, a deep and flavorful broth, a chunk of bok choy and plenty of noodles. I had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. I also tried the Dan Da noodles which were spicy and peanuty and an equally large serving size. The cold sesame noodles were refreshing, light and also had a peanuty flavor.

They all recommend it but I think if you have had soup dumplings in NYC or California, you might be a little disappointed. But for Pittsburgh, this place is really good. They make fresh noodles on site. \n\nI came in and the atmosphere was nice. It's a small restaurant in Squirrel Hill in the busy shopping and food area. The menu was different. You check off what you want and give it to the waitress. I checked off crab and pork soup dumplings, beef and green onion pancake, and a milk green tea with coconut lychee. \n\nFirst came the beef pancake roll. I really was not a fan. It looks very good and I usually do like scallion pancakes. It was very pretty and I'm sure others will like them a lot. \n\nThen the soup dumplings came as they normally do in a bamboo steamer. I was a little disappointed that a few of the dumplings had their soup seep out before I even opened the steamer. They provide tongs for those who are unable to pick up the dumplings without popping them with chopsticks. I just used my chopsticks and picked them up into my soup spoon and ate them with a little bit of vinegar. They were a little on the bland side but still pretty yummy. \n\nThe best part was the bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually milk tea. Other places in Pittsburgh offer bubble tea but they don't actually have tea. The lychee flavor matched perfectly with the tea. The bubbles, however, were mushy with little flavor. I prefer when they are a little bit sweet and cooked firm but not raw and crunchy in the middle. \n\nPittsburgh is sadly lacking in good Asian cuisine so this place is pretty amazing in that sense.",1.0,0.9771751761436462

The restaurant was empty of customers.  I placed a lunch menu order for carry-out.  I chose the Kung Pao Shrimp (with Soup and Fried Rice).  I ordered a separate pork egg roll as they usually are quite tasty here.\n\nWhen the boy was done taking my order, he sat back down at one of the tables and started to resume pulling the ends off snow peas, which he was doing before I walked in.  He never washed his hands before handing the food either.  Later, one of the kitchen staff came out front and started to talk to him in Chinese with my order ticket in his hand.  He then came to where I was sitting and informed me that he had neglected to charge me for the egg roll, but all were on the ticket.  I thought, sounds like that is your problem, not mine, since it was one the ticket that I had paid for.  I went ahead and paid the extra $1.46 for the egg roll.\n\nWhen my meal was ready to go, looked in the bag.  I had a bowl in the bag with my meal.  In the past, there was a Styrofoam container with rice and entr\u00e9e separated.  Not so anymore.  I asked why did I have a bowl, they explained they changed the way they packaged the meals now, but it was the same portion.  Ummm.. NOT the same portion at all.  I was still upset from the egg roll debacle and now I was getting less for the same price.  \n\nWhen I got home, I found they did not even bother to provide the sweet and sour dipping sauce for the egg role.  Glad I grabbed a couple of duck sauce packs before I left.  I started to eat the Dish I ordered and it was bland.  No heat for a Kung Pao dish.  The Wonton soup was also bland with no scallions and strips of pork in it as before.  The rice was very dried out too.\n\nSo sadly, this will be my last visit to this restaurant   I will be informing all my friends who I spoke to so highly of this place, to reconsider dining here as well.  The portion size and quality are not enough to make the stand out from Panda Express.  In fact, I would say you get about the same taste, but more quantity from Panda.
