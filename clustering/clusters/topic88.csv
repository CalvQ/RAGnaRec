I think the teachers make the class and I felt encouraged and successful enough to keep coming back (about 3 times a week for a few weeks).

I have been practicing yoga for several years and have never been so offended during my yoga practice. While I understand that there is a particular flow for Hatha/Bikram yoga (which I prefer Vinyasa Flow), I always try to push myself a little farther with what I have learned in my previous practices at different studios. In the middle of class, I attempted a slightly different pose from what was being taught (without interrupting my fellow yogi's) and the teacher called me out in the middle of class saying \""Can you please do the same pose as the rest of the class?\"" (in a derogatory tone) I was absolutely offended by his gesture so I rolled up my mat and walked right out of the class. I sincerely apologize to the other yogi's there for walking out in the middle of class and interrupting their practice but he could have been a bit more tactful with his approach. Perhaps pulling me aside after class and letting me know this was not okay with him would have been more appropriate. So rude! Perhaps it was rude of me to assume I can try and progress my yoga style during his class but I always had encouragment from my previous teachers for pushing myself to evolve in my practice.\n\nIn addition, because of the Groupon, the class was extremely packed and there was no room to move or do the poses correctly.

I have been doing yoga in this town for several years now & this is the one that continues to find a way to irk me almost everytime.  It's not the instructors, they are amazing.  However, the management in these studios seems more intent on greedily making money than actually providing a quality yoga experience for their communities.  \nI wrote this studio off awhile ago, but then last year decided to give them a second chance & join a friend for a \""community\"" class which was supposed to be $10.  When I went to pay with a credit card, they informed me I would have to pay $17 if I was not going to pay with cash.  So you want to penalize me for not paying in cash?  Um, a bit ridiculous don't you think?  After driving all the way to the other side of town, I paid it & enjoyed my class.  But I thought I'd never return.  \nThen this year, Groupon had an 8 class pckg available for a significant reduction in price.  One of my favorite instructors teaches there right now & so I decided to give the \""Sanctuary\"" a third try.  I was not informed that I only had 30 days from redeeming the groupon with the first class to use all 8 classes, I was under the impression I had until the Groupon expiration date.  So when I showed up for my third class I was told my Groupon had already expired.  They were completely unwilling to work with me.  So I left, drove down the street to Bodyheat Yoga & Pilates (an amazing studio btw) & paid even more than $17 for one of their classes.  For a studio like Yoga Sanctuary to charge what they do when they do not provide adequate space for changing, showering, etc... is ridiculous.  \nAlso, if you work at night, you don't have much choice of day classes, they have a limited number available, & nothing in the afternoons on any day except Saturday.  \nMost importantly, the spirit of yoga is one of giving, one of a generous spirit.  I do not begrudge a studio trying to make a profit & run a business.  But if that's all you're concerned about, you will not profit for long.  And I, for one, will never go back after all this.

The class was challenging...actually it was really challenging...but that's what I love about it. We did kirtan before every class, which really helped us to relax and be present for our practice.  I suggest going to this place and then eating at the weary traveler (after a shower of cause).",1.0,0.999697208404541

I have been to a few other yoga studios, and this one is unique. The teachers are dedicated and caring, and a sense of community emanates from the studio. Inner Fire also offers interesting seminars and trips which are great to augment your practice. Their bathrooms are nice, although they only have a few showers. They also have a nice seating area with books and complimentary hot tea.\n\nI avidly attended the Power Flow and Inner Fire Flow classes because Hot Yoga can sometimes be too much for me.

The Yoga class was very well taught and the teacher was extremely professional, she did an excellent job teaching the format she taught. My only conflict with the class was that the schedule was for a Vinyasa Flow class which is what I was going for and there was very little flow, much more of a hold and describe then a flow class, but again I want to emphasis that the teacher did a solid job if that is the style of class you enjoy. The studio was clean and comfortable. Here is why the rating is so low, the cost...The cost of a single class was $20.00 because I'm not local if i was local it would have been $17.00 which is still on the expensive side but I understanding the business of trying to get students to commit to more classes. I'm just struggling with how the community of yoga saying because you don't live close by you have to pay $3.00 extra. It does not embrace the essence of yoga that I believe in and that is the reason behind the low rating. I didn't find a sanctuary at all be very clearly the business of yoga in full force .

I'm no pro and I still have a lot to learn, but yoga is important to me and I'm experienced enough to write a review. It is the studio in Las Vegas that I prefer over the others because they have a lot of impressive talent and some classes that you can't find at any other studio in Las Vegas.\n\nI recently tried a Mysore class - I thought anything that makes you sore is probably a good workout. I had no idea it was an Asthanga practice group doing a set sequence and not a traditional class that is led by an instructor at the front of the room. Wow it was awesome! The teacher's name is Jennifer and she helped me understand the difference between Mysore and led classes - and the difference with a set sequence of poses. She gave me the attention I needed and started teaching me to memorize the sequence. Most of the poses I had done in flow classes, but Jennifer showed me the way they are supposed to be done and it made me work a lot harder and therefore the benefit to my body has been tremendous! \n\nAsthanga Mysore is harder than most of the classes I have attended anywhere, and it really challenges my mind and body. I forget some poses or get them out of order and Jennifer always reminds me and helps me in a way that makes me feel like I belong with people that blow my mind with what they can do in their practice. \n\nAs hard as it is for me to make the classes with my work schedule I have made it a top priority to go as much as I can. I would go every day if I could. Thanks Jennifer for being so knowledgable and providing rationale for everything you tell me that actually makes perfect sense!

That's right: 300 Bikram Yogis staying here for 9 weeks at a time, doing 11 yoga classes a week, plus lectures & posture clinic and Bollywood movies til 4am.  All of this happening in a casino environment.  It was a bit surreal at times.  \n\nTo quote Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson, there were definitely times when I was \""Getting the fear.\""  Walking through a casino full of smokers and gamblers and drunks after a 90 minute Bikram Yoga class is challenging at best, but...

The rooms were small but adequate.\n\nThe first room was 1516 & it was perfectly nice.  I thought the bed was firm & comfy enough & the tub was standard & clean.  The TV is kindof sad, tho, with not a lot of programming & movies are $15 each!  You can't even pause or rewind them - one chance to watch.  That's it.\n\nThe second room was 6-122 in the North Tower, which was located by the Scenic Elevator, which is a bit slow, but conveniently located near the gift shop & the yoga tent.  It was a little bigger with a mini fridge & a big, roomy bathtub.\n\nThe food at the Hilton was sad.  It was hard to get good service anywhere.  Everyone seemed like they hated their job and they were overworked.  The buffet meh.  It's a Buffet.  Paradise Cafe is OK.  Basically a Denny's in a Hilton.  The sandwich shop by the sports bar is decent.  The Margarita place is no better & the sushi at Benihana.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.\n\nI guess I really don't like casinos.

I've done pilates and yoga before (not hot) and doing it hot is definitely a way different experience.  \n\nI really like this place.  I don't have any other hot yoga studios to compare this to, but in my opinion, this is a good one.  You can't miss the building (the big white one off Rainbow near Russell).  The entrance is in the back by the way (I was confused the very first time I went).  Besides yoga and pilates, they also offer kettlebell (which I'm eager to try out) and Zumba (which I've tried and I guess its good, but I'm so uncoordinated I hated it).  Kettlebell and Zumba are not hot (can you imagine?).\n\nEverytime I go, I feel so good after my workout.  I like to catch Gabriella's pilates class - she is awesome and really kicks your butt.  At the same time, she is really motivating.  Doing these workouts in a class environment is really helpful - better than any workout that I can do myself in a gym.  \n\nThe hotness of the room varies from time to time, but its usually like 100 degree I think.  Definetly enough to get your sweat ON!  I always leave class drenched.  \n\nThe only complaint I have - the locker room for women is TINY.  The classes here get SUPER crowded.  I was in  a class with 70+ people one time.  Ugh.  The space is not a huge issue though since you mostly stay to your mat... but it becomes a problem in the tiny locker room space.  There usually isn't enough space to change so I just go home in my sweaty gear (ew).\n\nI've been going a few times a week for about a month and I feel good.  After my groupon expires, I'll probably still go.  \n\nIf you decide to try this place out, remember to bring your own mat, towel and face towel to wipe the sweat dripping down your face.

It's definitely not cheap to join, but they do offer different payment options that cater to different budgets.  The locker rooms also seemed very well-maintained and surprisingly the rooms did not smell.  I know they have some special type of flooring, which helps absorb the moisture.  \n\nTips:\n  *  If you are looking for Bikram, this is not the place.  This place used to be a Bikram certified institute, but since it decided to offer more variety it classes, they are no longer Bikram accredited.  Not a bad thing at all though.  I guess to hold the certification, a facility can only have Bikram classes.\n  *  Bring water, towel, and a yoga mat.  They have yoga mats for rent, but even with the free weeks membership, you'll save money by purchasing a Yoga mat for 10 bucks at Ross.\n  *  Get there early.  They are not suppose to allow late arrivals into the classroom and parking is a real pain.\n  *  Sign up for their free tour to get your week free membership.  \n  *  You get another free week on your birthday so make sure to put down that info when filing out your paperwork for the free tour.",1.0,0.7300576567649841

Studio Breathe isn't one. They promote a holistic approach to living better and being more zen, i.e. going with the flow. I like that. They do yoga - especially hot yoga, pilates, kick-boxing, karate, but also meditation and a bunch of kids' classes.\n\nWhen I worked downtown, my company offered free yoga classes twice a week and, afterwards, I enjoyed nothing so much as my Liquid Nutrition smoothie from the downstairs food court. A post-exertion smoothie, that picks you up without weighing you down, is available to me once again with the opening of Le Kitchen adjoining the studio. They appear to serve vegan food (it doesn't say it, but it looks like it is), which smelled amazing and looked delicious - salads and soups as well as smoothies. It does say \""gluten-free\"" on the window.\n\nI loved the old premises in the Nordelec building which, as other reviewers have said, were spacious and clean. The space itself promoted a certain \""zenitude\"". However, in the months before they moved, things had become a lot less zen, mainly due to the success of certain Groupon-type promotions. The changing rooms had become way too small, with not enough locker space or shower room (though most people shower at home).\n\nThe new premises are very different. There are many more lockers (but much less pretty and you have to bring your own locks now), and more showers (much better as they have an ante-cubicle for changing). But the main changing room is still cramped, in fact more so as it now serves as a thoroughfare, which wasn't the case before. Overall, it's less classy than it was, but they still have nice touches like the hairdryer.\n\nI only saw the hot yoga room, which is a nice, airy and light room, and I believe the Dojo is underneath it. It would appear that there are actually now fewer rooms, though I think more classes are being offered.\n\nThe service is great. I hadn't been for ages and wanted to pick up my previous card of classes. I sent an email and was called with an offer which suited me nicely. When I turned up at the studio for a class, the welcome was warm and friendly and everything was explained very well.\n\nThis is a young Montreal business, run by people who seem to really believe, and I encourage you to do yourself some good and support them.",1.0,0.9802792072296144

It ended instead of with the finishing sequence with doing a series of core and back exercises using foldable metal chairs.

Anyways, I would skip this French Canadian Ashtanga and instead go for a run along the river (fantastic) and then head to \""F-Bar\"" (1485 Rue Jeanne-Mance, fbar.ca) for a celestial delight of Portuguese-French fusion cuisine (Mackerel, coco beans, almond milk to start and then Halibut black raisins for the main course).  The Ashtanga in Paris and Strasbourg (not to mention Encinitas)  are much better and the run will balance out the calories from dinner and skipping chair yoga will save you back injury so will save you the cost of a massage and balance out the cost of dinner.

In the basement of an adorable but very busy corner just east of Uptown, I walked around the street and through the shops for about 15 minutes looking for the entrance. Not very fun when lugging a yoga mat and starting to freeze in your skimpy, thin yoga clothes.\n\nBut that is my lone complaint. The stairway leading down to the studio is covered from floor to as high as a tall man can reach with colorful sharpie signatures and doodles of asanas. The entry room is a friendly clutter of seating, shoes and cubbies. A friendly face greets you and helps you with any questions about class (this particular face was also very cute). I was handed a mat towel and invited to hang out and put my feet up till the next practice began. \n\nA cozy seating area with product for sale as well as a ton of reading materials, tea and coffee for $1, two bathrooms and non-assuming decor made me want to skip a coffee shop and come back to the yoga studio to work on my writing. When the class began, everyone was chatting and picking their marked spot on the floor (thank you for the mat outlines in tape!) - the atmosphere was relaxed and you could tell that everyone was there because they loved Yoga One and they loved their practice. After doing yoga at a corporate gym for the last 2 years, the sense of community in the room was balm for the soul.\n\nThe practice itself was challenging but flowed smoothly - suitable for beginners as well as more advanced students. I left exhausted, inspired, soaking wet with sweat (it's Baptiste style and done in a heated room) and with several class times scribbled on my hand for the next few days.\n\nYoga One is moving to a bigger location just down the road with better parking and more visibility. I'll be leaving Charlotte for a few months but I can't wait to come back and practice in the new venue.

I am brand new to yoga and my introduction was by way of Madison Improvement Club this last Monday. Even though I signed up for a beginner's fundamentals class at MIC, the instructor seemed to think it was a phenomenal flow class. She called out poses that I had NO IDEA how to do, didn't make any adjustments, and didn't play relaxing music or have much of a relaxing voice. \n\nThank goodness for Lara at Metta Yoga! She really accommodated me even though I signed up for a flow class instead of a beginner's class. The atmosphere was super relaxed and casual, and Lara really made me feel at home even though I was completely uncoordinated. The facility is small and clean, the classes are a manageable size and a mixture of all levels, and I really enjoyed the entire experience. \n\nI'm not a very spiritual person and I tend to hightail and run from activities that walk that fine line of crazy. I was really worried that yoga, in general, would be a bit nuttier than I like, but the neatest thing I found about the entire experience was finding that moment of real inner peace. For lack of a better term: zen? Quieting your mind and listening to your body really does open your eyes to an entire new experience - and before you know it, an entire 75 minutes has zipped by. If I were a spiritual person, I'd say that finding your moment of zen is almost like catching a glimpse of heaven. Thanks to Lara, I now know exactly what I'm searching for when practicing yoga.",1.0,0.9982264637947084

Never in my life have I ever been in such an unsupportative environment. Jim's adjustments are completely inappropriate. I should never have to feel my yoga teacher's good's on my body and his breath breathing down the side of my neck as if he was about to make out with me as I'm receiving an adjustment. (And these were just a few of the adjustments I received within the first five minutes of class, it went on from there). Additionally, the innuendos about the female anatomy and women's breast tissue were also completely inappropriate and offensive.\n\nFurthermore, Jim's instruction of igniting mula bandha are grossly inaccurate. No senior Ashtanga teacher will ever instruct you to squeeze your anus in order to cultivate mula bandha. In fact, senior Ashtanga teachers go out of their way to explain that this is not a correct application of mula bandha and that in doing so, will only create constipation. \n\nThere are plenty of other more informed and respectful yoga teachers in the Phoenix area to practice yoga with. Jim Keegan is not one of them. It pains me as a yoga teacher to know that this kind of inappropriate and arrogant behavior is masquerading under the guise of yoga.\n\nThe only reason I'm even giving this studio a star is because Yelp is making me.",0.0,0.999350130558014

I was proven wrong and found it more beneficial to be surrounded with open minded and teaching oriented individuals.   A great mix of novice to advanced from which I learned more about my own practice to enrich it for the future.\n\nExpectations of the yoga were to be done at a leisurely time each day.  I was personally joining up to escape the confines of time and rigorous weekly planning to fall into a niche of other yogi's and yogini's searching to have fun in paradise.  I was more than surprised to know we didn't have internet because unplugging, even though was a thought I was not going to achieve on my own, from the digital world is almost impossible.  I was more than pleased to truly leave the confines of the office on the mainland.   The choice of accommodations help to promote community and not exclude anyone from the group.

Frankly, as long as I was surrounded by laughter, ocean, sand and an occasional beer I could care less where we were at that moment.  Jim made a great effort to help us all explore the island and maintain group cohesion.  I commend him on accepting a group for who they are.\n\nAn experience is built on environment and people.

About 3/4 of the class was Yin, and then the last part was the flow that we all know and love.  I didn't know what Yin was or what to expect at all going into the class, so I spent much of the class confused by the stillness, and by the time my brain quieted down a little, we were already moving into Flow.   I definitely want to try it again now that I \""get\"" it.  My mind rarely shuts up and leaves me alone, so a class that allows for a little more of a quiet state might be really good for me.\n\nThere are quite a few other classes i want to try, and I will update this when I do.\n\nThe inside is also really pretty.  The studio itself has a dark wood floors, and candles from the ceiling and around the perimeter of the room.  Little cubbies for your shoes and purse, and they've got blankets and bolsters, but I'm not sure about mats.  \n\nFull disclosure:  I also like the owners very much.  They are very community minded, and I am all about supporting the locals and banding together so it makes me so happy to meet others that feel the same.

The teachers are all really knowledgeable about the poses - why they are the way they are and what each one does for the body - and they share that knowledge with the class. The studio is small, which means that the classes feel more personal. The teachers all seem to really care about the students, from remembering your name to noticing when you need some help with a pose. I also dig that this is NOT your typical yoga population (i.e. people of all ages, genders, colors, and sizes do yoga here).

I practice advanced yoga 2-3 times a week and have attended classes at a few other hot yoga studios, but never practiced Bikram.  I had a two month unlimited membership and only went four times during those two months.  \n\nFirst of all, I was not wild about the Bikram practice - I like more variety, but to each his own.  I think if you want to develop your Bikram yoga practice into more advanced poses you will have to go to teacher training.  All classes in this studio are at the same level and I don't remember any pose modifications being offered.\n\nAlso, I did not like the instructors scolding me when I took a sip of water, wiped the burning sweat out of my eyes, or removed my wedgie.  It is very difficult to hold a tree posed when you have a slow-flowing river moving down your leg.  I fared okay with the heat, but there was a girl in my class who had to sit down for over half of the class.  The instructor regularly checked in on her (which was nice), but when she asked if she could leave the room, the instructor told her \""only if [she was] going to pass out.\""\n\nThe whole experience seemed a little cult-like to me (and according to Details Magazine, I'm not the only one).  All of the instructors greeted you by name in a very sedated tone and wore (seriously) next to nothing.  And they encourage you to buy into the whole lifestyle - practicing everyday or more than once a day.\n\nI will say that the location is ideal and the facility is nice and clean.  I would prefer it if the room were a little less bright.  I'm a pretty confident person, but feeling like I was practicing in an operating room made me a little self-conscious.   The bright lights also makes it difficult to concentrate when you can clearly make out every  little bump in your instructor's Speedo (whether you want to see it or not).\n\nI'm glad I gave it a try, but it's just not for me.  Such is the beauty of Groupon.",0.0,0.9759498238563538

(Three showers in each locker room and much more mirror in the studio.)

In reply to my commentary that floors /mats/anything really were not cleaned before or after class, and there is a heavy smell of urine bathing the whole room, he suggested that I am the one who smells like urine. Excellent business to attend!\nNot to mention the authoritative suggestion to delete my own review.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nI am writing this review secretly hoping that the instructors from the location will see this and take matter in their own hands.\n\nHere is my personal story. I can put up with almost everything related to bikram yoga: the heat is fine, the totalitarian reign of bikram yoga instructors is fine, 90 minutes is fine, the speedos and crowds are fine. While I am a dilettante and I do not understand the philosophy behind it, I respect and follow.\n\nThere is, however, one thing that I cannot put up with while I practice: the heavy smell of urine that oozes from the floors and the mats that they give for rent (?). Lack of hygiene has taken a new level in this location. You come in and enter the sweaty hall (which is completely understandable, there was a class right before you came in where an average of 40 people were sweating like satan in Sahara), and then you realize that you will bask in their own sweat as much as you will in yours, because nobody cleans the floors, and the mats that are aligned next to the walls will never be cleaned, only sprayed with some water and aligned back on the racks. There is no spray to clean even your own mat, and as you exercise, just when you have completely forgotten about the deal, yet another whiff of heavy, rancid urine hits you unexpectedly. ( I still have not figured out the mystery of: why on earth does it smell like urine and not like sweat?)\n\nOther than that, instructors are really cool, but as I said, I put up with not drinking water and savasana is my dear friend.\n\nI  am giving this place 2 stars (oops, not after seeing the owner's comment) because the groupon was very cheap. However, beware: if you want a full year subscription it is $1000. And then you know what you have to put up with...",0.0,0.9947906732559204

I have been going to this studio on and off (due to money and time issues) since 2009 when the studio was under a different owner and in a different location. I've also been to studios near my hometown in Massachusetts that I didn't like nearly as much because the teacher barked orders into a microphone and said that every posture should hurt. The new location is excellent and the studio is much nicer with the hard wood floors than the old carpet. They also clean the yoga room after each class which I appreciate. I do miss some of the older teachers but the newer ones are still good.\n\nThe teachers here are very helpful when you ask them a question. I love that Shannon or Zeb will stop the class to show the correct way to do a posture. I also love that all of the teachers will point out people when people are doing well. I know when I hear my name it gives me a boost of confidence and I try harder to do the postures the correct way. I will say I was surprised the one time I rejoined and they recommended no water during class but I have since learned that class really does go better without it. \n\nI'm not going to lie, this yoga is pricey but ALL Bikram yoga studios charge the same, if not more, for tuition. Also, if you have issues taking your shoes off and walking around or seeing nearly naked people in class and naked people in the dressing rooms, this probably isn't for you.",1.0,0.981439173221588

The instructors here are good at reminding you to listen to your body and do only what it needs and wants to do.\n\nThe Groupons I've picked up for this studio make it worth it to me because I like going in and getting a good sweat on, but I don't think I would do a membership.

The heat was unbearable and I was so grossed out by the humid, surely fungus-infected carpet, not to mention turned off by the drill sergeant, vaguely cultish, you must stay in the room BS. \n\nSeveral years later a friend took me to Sumits at McCormick Ranch.  Much more appealing. A set-series, Sumits flow is a nicely-composed hybrid of Bikrim and vinyasa, perfect for people who crave a lil' motion in their practice.  The class emphasis is more about feeling good, staying positive, and sticking with it than about how well you can do the pose.  If you are new, the staff will take time to introduce themselves and learn your name.  After you finish your first class you'll be congratulated and encouraged to return (smart marketing eh?).  If only all studios and fitness clubs treated people that way!  \n\nThough hot, the room temps aren't as stifling as traditional Bikrim.  Luckily Sumits has wood floors so when you do sweat - and you will - it's not going to be memorialized into a bio hazardous carpet.  Thankfully they mop the floors between each class.\n\nOnly the flow portion of the class is conducted to music. Like the other reviewers I too wish they'd turn the volume down, it doesn't accomplish anything.  Shavasana is a bit perfunctory - they don't really give you enough time to melt into your nothingness, but you can stay in the room longer if you like.\n\nI am perplexed why all women don't race to the showers after class - the changing rooms and showers are always very clean and stocked with cleaning products.  A cold shower feels blissful after sweating your brains out for over an hour.  Their loss, my gain I guess. \n\nSumits is a great choice for people of all ages and abilities who like a good (HOT) workout or want to try yoga in a positive environment.  If you are a more experienced yoga practitioner, Sumits is a nice addition to a more robust practice.  Do not expect to receive adjustments, tips on technique, or to explore more advanced poses - that's not what this experience is about.  That said, Sumits has been expanding its offerings over the past few years - from integrating flow classes to workshops - so there appears to be new opportunities for yoga growth within the Sumits brand.\n\nBring water, a hand towel, and invest in a yoga towel mat.

It's worth waking up early to take his classes--even if you're on vacation!  He's definitely worth at least 4 stars\n\nOn the other hand, the class I attended yesterday at 11:15 (I believe with Steph) was absolutely dreadful--the only thing that came to mind during the class was \""WHAT A b****\"" which is something I've NEVER thought during a class or at a yoga studio and never want to again and I'm SURE others agreed with me from their facial expressions and dirty looks to her comments.  She did not make ANY beneficial comments to help people in the class improve their postures.  I actually noticed some individuals who were doing certain postures wrong (ex: not holding their foot the right way) and she didn't catch it or say anything.  On the other hand, she told this one lady in class to move her ponytail during savasana and called another lady a turtle for being too slow to get up.  Completely juvenille, demeaning, unprofessional and just plain annoying.  If I wanted to hear incessant nagging, I'd go to my grandma's.  Seriously, she totally ruined my mood.  Yoga is supposed to be relaxing, enjoyable yet all she did was make me aggravated.  She's just unmotivating and ruins your whole mood.

My favorite thing is the variety of classes and the abundance of class times also.  I have a very full and busy schedule and I can also usually find a class that fits into my schedule between work and school and everything else almost every day.  \nThere are I'd say, at least 20 different class types (styles of yoga) that you can choose, but my favorites are the \""Inner Vision HOT Flow,\"" the Level 1-2, and the Power classes.  \nDefinitely sign up for a new student special... unlimited classes for two weeks for $29 dollars.  That way you can see what classes you like, see what teachers you like, and see how often you'll be going... that way when you do sign up for class packages, you can see which one would be financially best for you.\nBoth locations are great though.  I love the lakefront view room at the Chandler studio, and the reception area of the Tempe one is really nice, inviting, and relaxing.  I go to both about equally depending on which teachers and classes I want to take.  \nAlso, the website is super helpful.  You can purchase classes that way and see which teachers are teaching at which times... teacher bios and great yoga info and faqs in general.",1.0,0.9992480874061584

The class time worked into my schedule and I wanted a challenging practice. I normally went to classes lead by Aaron, one of the owners. He teaches in a clear, concise manner and he is not really a hands on instructor, as some are. I did notice that he rarely ever smiles, which does change the atmosphere of the room. \n\nThe InnerVision flow class itself is definitely a challenge and well worth the try. Over time though, I did wish the class had some variety, but I guess that's the nature of the set postures. Some of the other instructors will occasionally mix it up (like Gabe or Josh) by allowing you a few minutes to go into shoulder stand or do a pose you want, which I really enjoy. And the studio itself does have a very large variety of classes to try out. \n\nSometimes the studio can get pretty full, especially in the evening classes, so be prepared for that. This means the room will be hotter and that space is limited. One thing that really bothered me is how often people show up late and are allowed in. If everyone is already set up with their mats in a crowded room, getting in the right mindset, calming down, de-stressing, etc  - it takes time out of your practice and your mental state to move your stuff and adjust to the person who just came in. It's especially frustrating when the late person sets up and leaves no room for any arm movements and you're basically fumbling on top of one another. I know, I know, I shouldn't let this get to me because it sorts of defeats the purpose of yoga, but a little consideration for your fellow yogis/yoginis would be nice. The instructors never say anything about this, but I'm not sure if they have a policy against doing so. \n\nOne other thing I noticed that I find sort of strange is the lights in the studio. They use fluorescent lighting with pictures of clouds over the lighting to mask the quality of light. I find these lights stressful because they remind me of the office and/or school. During the cool down stage they turn off the fluorescent lights and turn on warmer spot lighting, which I find much more calming. I wonder if this has to do with the heat the lights emit, but either way, during my yoga practice I prefer mood lighting or natural light because I want to get out of the \""real world\"" and into myself.\n\nBottom line: the classes are good, studio has great variety, but the details and subtleties do make a difference.",0.0,0.9529430270195008

You should know that I hate saunas - longest time in a sauna ever was about 30 seconds. But I love a good masochistic workout, so I really wanted to try this.\n\nFirst of all, about the facility. I have done yoga in many studios and love my classes at the YMCA in Ahwatukee. This yoga studio is so so beautiful! The space is open, inviting, relaxing, and extremely clean. The hot room has ceiling fans, and when it gets too warm, the instructor opens the doors to let cool air in. Even with all the bodies in the room, there was NO stinkiness!! This was always my biggest fear about hot yoga. \n\nI wore capri yoga pants and a yoga top. I brought a full length towel, huge bottle of water and a yoga mat. The instructor placed me close to the door in case I needed to cool down. The class pace was perfect - flowing from one pose to the next. There was wonderful non-new-agemusic playing on a great sound system the whole time. The posture instructions were clear and easy to follow, however, I think it would be difficult for a beginner. It could be that the instructor knew there were no beginners, and therefore, didn't go slow. I had to stop three times towards the end of the class. I was too hot and my heart was beating too fast. After a three minute break (still in the room) and some water, I could finish with the class. My mat, clothes and towel were completely wet - I'm not talking damp - I mean WET. I highly recommend bringing an extra change of clothes for after class  and wearing as little clothing as respectably possible in the class!\n\nThe class costs $16 for an individual session, or $20 for two classes (two weeks in a row). They have a ton of different class purchase plans available with varying discount levels, depending on how many sessions you purchase. I don't see myself doing this regularly, but LOVED the experience and highly recommend this facility!",1.0,0.9991621971130372

One key difference I found between Bikram and Sumit is that Bikram is more meditative.  Bikram moves a bit slower with savasanas (sp?) during the floor series.  There's also a lot of emphasis on breathing exercises.  Sumit classes lean more on the work-out aspect, with push-ups and sit-ups and Vinyasas.  These are pluses if you are looking just for a work-out.  But for myself, where I enjoy mixing things up with resistance and cardio type exercises, the meditative aspects of Bikram are a big reason I go.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bikram is a very challenging work-out - I'm struggling through the entire class, however in Bikram I feel like I'm truly getting away from stresses in life for 90 min.  Whereas Sumit's I feel there's an element of just figuring out how to keep up and what to do next - and that's a stress in itself.",1.0,0.919239580631256

I've done bikram yoga before, and while I [almost] despise it, I'll try not to let my bias get in the way of this review. For those who aren't aware, bikram yoga is typically done in 90 minute sessions in 104 degrees with 40% humidity. That's enough to make people sweat, or worse yet, faint before even entering. But if that's what you want and you are aware, there's no reason why a bikram yoga place can't get 5 stars. So here's why I'm giving 2. If people feel dehydrated or suffocated, they shouldn't be pushed to stay. It is not only unsafe but stupid. There should be fair warning for what the class will entail prior to the session for those less knowledgeable. Then, as aforementioned, during the session there should be more awareness for health and safety. People should be reminded to stay hydrated and to take a break if they are uncomfortable. The yoga instructor said \""if you are feeling dizzy like you want to faint or throw up, don't worry, it's normal!\"" Uh no. That's not normal. No where in human medicine is the feeling of wanting to faint or vomit normal. And patrons should be informed of this. If you want to get water, GET IT. If you want to leave, LEAVE. If you need to stop, STOP. Don't force yourself to do something totally and completely unnecessary. I was a first timer here and I stayed in the room for the full 90 minutes and attempted/did every single pose. I was complimented profusely. Those who left in the middle or had to rest were considered weak. That's not right. Just because I stayed doesn't give me more merit, and someone who had the wits to leave when they weren't feeling good shouldn't be mocked. I have had instructors that push you to a certain extent, and don't condone what is unsafe. That's why this place gets 2 stars in my book. \n\nAnd now for my bias. If I want a good workout or a good sweating session, there are far  better activities that come to mind. 'Nuff said.",0.0,0.9973121881484984

About 1hour into the 90 minute class I started to feel dizzy, and the humidity was a little overwhelming for me. So I tried to go to the bathroom and she stopped instructing the class, blocked my way out and over the microphone asked me where I was going.

I couldn't get my groupon voucher to cooperate on my phone and he stood there peering over my shoulder and treating me like I probably didn't have the groupon. He asked me if I had been there before and I said yes, it has been over 3 years and before I could even finish my sentence he cut me off and said \""Groupons are for new customers only, it says so in the fine print!\"" I was taken aback by his snappiness and it showed on my face. He looked at me and said \""Wow\"" in the most scrutinizing and arrogant tone. Wow, talk about an unwelcome feeling!

They must have enough money that they don't need any more business at all! I walked out and went right home to have my groupon refunded immediately. Apparently, they told my aunt that if I would have come back they could have used my groupon towards a package but since I felt the environment was so hostile, I had no desire to spend any more money there.

I want to state I love lululemon yoga clothes.\n\nMy big disappointment is regarding the staff at this store and the treatment I received from a high end athletic wear store.  The first thing that happened was when I was trying to find yoga pants I had to ask people who worked at the store what their thoughts about what I should try on for my yoga needs and the best was when I asked a staff member about the fabric and his thoughts where about the pants I selected for hot yoga..  He looked at me with a blank stare and proceeded to read the description provided on the pants and said the fabric is just like the other fabrics we have at the store.  I also asked other staff members and did not receive anymore information. \n\nI managed to find what I was looking for on my own.  The staff was helpful in getting me different sizes I needed from the dressing room.   The next surprise was at the check out counter.  After the person rang me up and I paid this staff person she took all the items in her hands and shoved all the clothing in a bag without folding the clothing.  \n\nThis staff person and what looked like the entire staff were at this time at the front of the store talking about their lululemon clothes they had just put on from the store.   I took my bag and on the floor took the items out of the bag and proceeded to fold the clothes.  The staff just stood there and continued to talk about the clothes they where wearing from the store.   \n\nI am very disappointed at lululemon and their customer service.",0.0,0.9983589053153992

The tagline for At One went something like \""Yoga, Fashion, Music\"" and that really sums up the Life Power yoga vibe. The good: the facility is nice, clean, and well appointed. There are some good teachers that teach here: my favorites include John S., Jenn C., and Abbie C. The bad: there are some teachers that just seem bored and jaded (I won't name names), and this goes for the front desk staff. There's one lady who works the front desk who is decidedly cold and prickly. Some of the classes are mat-to-mat crowded, this can be fun, but here, not so much. I had one of the worst yoga classes in my life here recently because a person next to me had serious attitude about people being in her space in a mat-to-mat class. My other peeve is the music.

There is quite a range of experience amongst the students, and they enable all of them to get the most out of the practice. The first time I ever practiced was at the Hive, and it was incredibly comfortable and a memorable experience. \n\nFulfilling - I don't like the notion that yoga is a workout. You have to exert yourself physically, but it's not just for the sake of getting 'in shape'.  The Hive embraces yoga as a spiritual and physical practice. Some studios I have attended, the practice feels void of any spiritual aspect, and feels more like aerobics than yoga. When I leave the studio, I am both physically and spiritually fulfilled, and it's wonderful. \n\nCommunity - The instructors genuinely care about the well being of the students and the students care about the well being of each other. Everyone there truly embraces the practice as a force of good in our lives. Some studios have instructors that have all the yogi credentials in the world - but they don't care about their students and it shows. The instructors are not only well qualified and gifted at their practice - but they want to see their students realize their potential. \n\nBottom line is that it's one of the more affordable studios in the city - but you don't sacrifice anything for the price. The studio space, class selection, and instructors are all top notch.\n\nIf you haven't done yoga ever in your life, this is the place to start.

Saturday mornings have consistently been advertised as the $5 community class at Yoga Hive.  I checked the schedule online to be sure that the class was not canceled due to the holiday season.  I observed that it was not canceled but that there was a sub (Kimberly, the owner).  \n\nWhen we showed up this morning, as is often the case, the entry way was terribly crowded, and we had to wait outside in the elements as people inside took their time making space for others.  From the entrance, I could hear the owner chatting loudly.  This is not the kind of intentional calm and mindfulness that I would expect from a yoga studio.  When my sister approached Kimberly and let her know that it was her first time there, unlike her chatty rapport with the people she seemed to know, she did not welcome her, but asked her to stand to the side.  We then realized that the class was $14 (the regular admission) because there was a substitute instructor.  For a studio that is located in the quickly gentrifying Garfield neighbor, I feel that the very least that could be done to cater to the \""community\"" is to offer a weekly $5 class.  If there is a change in that price, it should be stated loudly and clearly on the website.

It's a cheap exposure to what it feels like to move in a heated room, but is a far cry from yoga, and def is not a relaxing, enlightening practice where you can develop any sort of skill. You cant even do half of the movements without hitting your neighbor. I wouldn't go back, and I certainly wouldn't pay a monthly fee here when there are so many good practices in Charlotte ( Be Yoga, Yoga One, Laughing Buddha).",0.0,0.9970840811729432

The staff is incredibly personable and friendly. I have only been a handful of times but I'm seriously considering going back  ASAP. I initially went to Arrichion when a friend graciously paid my way for a class. He figured I would like that sort of thing and he was right! \n\nMy first class was the Hot Yoga/ Circuit class and I felt AWESOME afterwards. The class was an hour long and consisted of half an hour of hot yoga, then half an hour of lifting and plyometrics. I remember thinking to myself \""If I did this just 3 times a week, I wold be diesel.\"" No joke. This class is NOT for beginners or those who aren't too familiar with yoga or lifting. If you are a beginner, I would suggest you make sure the staff knows this as well. \n\nWhen you do take a hot yoga class, be sure to bring a mat (or rent one) and a very big towel to cover your mat (or a yoga towel) as well as a water bottle and a hand towel to wipe your sweaty-as-crap body and face. Umm yeah.... you're gonna sweat like you never thought you could. But it's a good kind of sweat.. like when you just KNOW you're ridding your body of chocolate cake, beer, pizza and makeup. (Does that even make sense?)\n\nBonus: Arrichion usually offers Living Social deals and deals for beginners for only $20 for a full month of classes. That is a downright steal for the amount of attention and results that are guaranteed from these classes. \n\nCall ahead and ask questions if you're scared to take the hot yoga plunge and the nice peeps there will even give you a tour if you are still apprehensive of joining. I promise you, though, that you will thank yourself for trying even the first class and will most likely become addicted after that.

I like yoga because it is generally a more personal practice where the instructors lead everyone to find a personal level accomplishment and each class varies in the flow. I didn't get the same sense of trust or guidance since the Arrichion instructors did not provide any one-on-one correction or clarification. I know I need help finding some of the postures.

I have been practicing yoga for several years and prefer power yoga classes.  My friend had never done yoga before.  \n\nSome good news:\n\n1.  Location and studio - Beautiful studio in a great location (for me and my friends who live in Avalon, anyway!).  They really did a nice job with the interior.  Nice heat in the hot classes.\n2.  Friendliness -  The staff here are the friendliest group I've encountered in any yoga studio in Pittsburgh.  They make you feel comfortable and welcome, whether you are a beginner or not, and are available to answer questions before and after class. \n\nA few reasons why I gave Yoga on Fremont 3 stars:\n\n1.  Class inconsistency - My experience at Yoga on Fremont greatly depended on who was teaching the class.  I don't like to criticize teachers, and I get something out of every class I take, but sometimes the description of the class does not match the class itself.  I took a Vinyasa Flow class that is described on the website as \""fast paced\"" and \""aerobic\"" and felt like it was more of a gentle yoga class that would be more appropriate for very new students, or senior students.  There was no flow and the teacher just didn't seem comfortable teaching the class.  \n2.  Geared towards beginners - In my experience, every class I've taken at YoF, with the exception of Melissa's Hot Power Yoga class (which is a fantastic class, but unfortunately only offered once a week), is geared towards beginner yogi's and does not leave a lot of time to build on postures if you are used to doing so in your practice.  This is not exactly a negative for YoF (it was perfect for my beginner friend), just a personal preference.   \n\nI will continue to take classes at YoF and recommend it to others, especially if you have always wanted to take a yoga class but were nervous.  YoF offers a welcoming environment to try it out, get some one on one attention, and see if it's for you!",0.0,0.8938107490539551

They began in a smaller space in the same building but always had that comforting yoga berry tea to warm their patrons before and after yoga. This year in end September, they expanded their space and you can access it from both Williamson Street and the Sardine parking lot.\n\nKathleen is the owner and I love that she is very innovative and comes up with classes for all interests and skills. For beginners, you can start with a beginner workshop that lasts 4 weeks to gain the confidence you need in yoga. For couples, there are occasional 2 hour workshops that let you explore practicing yoga together and achieving further limits. There's also yoga barre classes which look very interesting but I'm probably not athletic enough to try out. For people who are looking into getting fit, there are also 8 week workshops to help you achieve your goals.\n\nMy favorite classes are gentle flow and the restorative yoga sessions. John on Thursday evenings has a really good series going on and Kathleen's classes are also very relaxing on Sunday evenings. Most of these classes except beginner and restorative yoga are in a heated environment, which provides a great workout and sweat loss! In the current location, the basement also has shower rooms for people who need to get refreshed before heading out for their activities! \n\nLove the variety of programs and place to hang out before and after classes.

But the clincher was that the monks thought nothing odd about having the main phone & answering machine right there in the room, bell ringing loudly while 3 calls came in, complete with the audible outgoing message and loud response from whomever was leaving incoming messages. \nI know some meditation tradititions encourage meditating with eyes partially open & allowing lifes natural noises to be heard, but a ringing phone and answering machine right there in the meditation room?\nIs that really a wise choice in a place where the object is to turn inward and experience a quiet mind??",0.0,0.828835129737854

I figured he got the better end of the deal, but I tagged along anyway to torture myself for a couple of hours.\n\nOur group started by running a couple laps outside on the parking lot, which I really enjoyed because I'm a slave to the treadmill. After warming up outside, we headed inside to do a set of drills. Each station had 2 exercises that had to be done for about 1min each. After each station was complete, you would rotate to the right/left until the whole circuit was complete. We were put into groups of 3 and did the circuit twice back to back, with a couple seconds rest between each station.\n\nThe drills were pretty varied. Suicide runs, squats, weight-lunges, stair runs, burpees, balance-exercises, and so on. The group had about 10-15 people with a giant range of physical ability. The teacher kept a good pace and corrected people as he saw fit. Some things that I noted was that you really need to push and motivate yourself to work out here- as there are many people who might not be as fast/strong, its easy to not do your maximum effort and stay unnoticed. That completely defeats the purpose of attending a class, but its very easy to fall into.\n\nOne of the things that is definitely lacking is stretching. As soon as the time starts, everyone goes straight to their exercises and leave straight after they are done. I think the class should definitely do group stretching before and after their workouts and the teacher should be instructing people on how to stretch properly to make sure they don't pull anything or get injured. \n\nI do know some people in the class who lost an insane amount of weight by joining this class, which shows that you can have as great results as you push yourself for- but you HAVE to push yourself. I would suggest doing this in combination with some long distance running, yoga class, zumba or any other workouts to prevent this from turning into something completely monotonous.",0.0,0.9922894835472108

A very minimalist, modern exterior, Flex + Fit feels almost like they've not yet moved in - the walls are tall, the floors are concrete, and the furnishings are sparse.  It's located in the Duke Energy building, down a long and winding hallway from the main elevator lobby (leave breadcrumbs to find your way back, seriously).  The check-in desk offers a few shopping items (shirts, water bottles, shampoo), but the main attraction of interest is the cooking area.  Last night, the chef from Cowfish was teaching a class to about 10 people, and it smelled amazing (way better than your standard stale popcorn and arena hotdogs).  \n\nAll that to say, I'm nearly ready to quit my day job and join the F+F circus. We did the Air Fitness class, which is unlike anything I've ever done before... maybe best described as a Daredevil Yoga class?  Using long silk ropes hanging from the ceiling, you pull, flip, and balance yourself in a variety of positions, using gravity to provide a deeper stretch or workout.  Envision yourself hanging upside-down, held off the ground only by a stretch of silk wrapped precariously around your torso or standing on the U of the silk, swinging like you're back on the playground... yeah, you've almost got it.  Interesting and different, to say the least.  I had some serious belly laughs (and some slight bruising around my waist, but I'm the only one from my group who got that, so let's call it user error), but I do wonder just how much of an actual workout this \""fitness\"" experience provided.  \n\nEveryone I interacted with was super nice, and the 2-hour validated parking is a nice touch.  Although it's probably not going to become part of my standard routine, I'm definitely interested in going back to try a cooking session or one of the spin classes.

But my experience at Bikram Squirrel Hill quickly turned it into a mild addiction after my first few sessions\n\nI signed up for an introductory offer of unlimited classes for a fraction of the normal cost. I felt very comfortable as a complete beginner to bikram, and to the studio in general.  The employees were friendly in explaining to me how everything works, and the instructor made sure to remember my name for the class.\n\nI typically hate heat, but I really enjoyed spending an hour and a half stretching out before having to brave the January cold. That said, I don't know how willing I would be to do bikram at the peak of summer. The first class was a little strange, especially as some people seemed very intense about their practice, but I learned a lot by watching. The instructor didn't single me out at all, but I didn't have any trouble following. Employees urged newcomers (well, everyone) to sit if we felt overheated or dizzy, and I did make use of that suggestion once. They encouraged us to stay in the room, though, to let the feeling pass.\n\nI made a lot of progress quickly, and within a week could hold poses with which I struggled initially. It became a routine for me to go to bikram after crossfit workouts that were short and intense so that I could stretch out my muscles in the heat. \n\nThe studio is clean and quite simple. Some classes become very crowded to the point that once I was blocked into a corner and couldn't fully extend for some poses, so it's worth it to go to the less popular ones (like the last class of the night). The locker rooms are nice and clean, with plenty of space to store your stuff during class. The people were not particularly friendly (though I'm used to super-supportive crossfitters) but not in the least bit mean or judgmental. \n\nI'm not living in Pittsburgh right now, but I hope to spend my cold months practicing bikram here again.",1.0,0.9609315991401672

Ruby is also a great instructor!\n\nHowever, Kim did not give the best impressions to my mother and myself. We sat in the back, as they want all people who are not members (aka drop ins or groupon/amazon local students) to be in the back row. After having a few classes with Kim, she began moving me up to the front to use me as an example once she saw I memorized the flow and could do all of the poses. On this particular day though, I intentionally went to class with my mother because we do not get to see each other often. She immediately asks me to move up front (even though we weren't talking). I explained to her the situation and got a \""we'll see\"" in response. She walked away to return five minutes later for the start of the class and demanded me to move to the front row. She also made my mom move up front but intentionally put us on opposite ends. I am very easygoing, but this totally ruined the energy in the room, not to mention it drew a lot of attention to the situation. \n\nOverall, I recommend this place if you make sure you're attending Ruby's classes. It has potential because they have great classes but needs a bit better customer service!",0.0,0.9935622215270996

The people who run the place are friendly and very nice.\n\nI went there because I was given a pack of courses as a gift. The only time I could go was on Wednesday evening and that's when they have the Yoga Foundations classes. The type of yoga was challenging and quite frankly, was awkward at times. We were instructed to build complex setups with blocks and chairs and cushions on top of which we had to lie and keep a difficult pose for a long period. Everyone had trouble getting set up and we spent more time getting ready than doing the actual poses. Finally, everyone ended up having numb legs and feet and our knees would hurt from sitting on our knees for too long. And often, the postures using the chairs left us with a lot of back an neck pain. Especially those where we had to do awkward inversions. I am very sceptical about how beneficial that was as the next day my spine would hurt in a couple of areas and a bad headache from the muscle pain in my shoulders and neck.\n\nI don't know about the other classes, but I wouldn't recommend doing the Yoga Foundations classes, especially if you have back problems.\n\nOther than that, like I said, I've only attended that one kind of class so I can't say what the other ones are like.

I find the strip overwhelming and obnoxious, and the city seems poorly planned; however, I had to be in Vegas for a trade show and desperately needed some anti-gravity yoga to counteract the general stress of travel and walking around the huge convention center.  Needless to say I was SO pleased to discover that Vegas has an anti-gravity option, and willingly drove to Shine to get some flying in! \n\nShine was great for visiting, but I am grateful it is not my everyday studio.  The warehouse is large and very industrial feeling.  The class \""rooms\"" are only separated by curtains, which is great for keeping the space flexible, but it makes it really hard when there are multiple classes going on at once, as each class had competing music.  I also didn't like having to walk right by the stripper poles to get to the hammocks.\n\nI have been taking anti-gravity classes once a week for about 8 months now, but am still in many ways a beginner.  While in Vegas I took two classes at Shine, and each time there were a couple of brand new students as well as a couple of regulars.  My first class was taught by a lovely french girl who was patient and kind with all the new students, but still managed to keep the class going at a good pace.\n\nThe second class was taught by a different teacher who clearly struggled with balancing the needs of the new students with the needs of her regulars.  In all my years of doing different types of Yoga, I have found that the best teachers are those that can really \""read\"" the needs of the room, and adjust their lesson plan accordingly.  Advanced students usually are comfortable and competent enough to hold a pose for longer or work towards their own advanced forms, while the teacher is adjusting or working with the beginners.  This was not the case with this second teacher, she seemed at times flustered and I felt she rushed through explaining things so that she could make sure she got through her complete list of poses.  \n\nThe front desk gal was extremely welcoming and kind.  There was also a gentleman behind the desk on my second visit who gave a great restaurant recommendation.  All in all, I was thrilled to find Shine, and if I ever *have* to be in Vegas again, I will be very happy to get inverted here!",1.0,0.9905422329902648

My first Bikram yoga class was actually taught by Bikram himself & I have been hooked ever since. I usually go to the studios located on the west side of town and I was excited to try the new location because it is closer to my home. First, I must say the place is beautiful and the carpet is the best out of all of the Vegas Bikram yoga studios. This location has the best locker room, too. I don't like how the mirror is on the opposite side of the window to the parking lot, it is distracting and too bright. I would suggest a darker tint on the windows in the studio. And now for the big negative which will cause me to never come to this location again... From what I understand and what I was told by Bikram, the room while practicing Bikram yoga should be at about 105-107 degrees with 40% humidity. Every time I went to this location I felt the room temperature was not monitored at all. It was way too hot, so hot my feet burned when they were on the carpet! My last visit, half the room sat out more than half of the class time and I almost passed out, which has NEVER happened to me. I heard mutterings from other yogis on how it was way too hot, as well.  People ran out of their water and the teacher would leave and get a water for them and then tell the receptionist who it was for so they could charge them for it. So I decided to look at the temperature to see how hot the room was and it said 122 degrees! I was shocked and very upset about this! That is way beyond what the temp should be, it was no wonder I almost fainted. I strongly urge the instructors of this studio to please monitor and adjust the temperature. For now, I will not be coming back here and I even have some classes left to use that I already paid for. It is not worth it to use them because I'd rather go to do yoga, not to become overexposed to extreme heat.",0.0,0.9955156445503236

He did ask me if I took a cab so, if needed they could have a cab ready for me after class. Also impressive!  The studio was whistle clean. I'm not sure what these other folks were yelping about.  A lot of Hot Yoga studios do smell like dirty feet. This place did not!  Yes, the room did have carpet but whatever the fiber was, didn't hold onto sweat or stink. Yes, the room was hot. It's known as hot yoga for a reason. Anyone who attends Bikram knows they can lay down on the mat at anytime (Savasana). \n\nMy first day of class had about 40 people and second about 30. I had Marie one day and Amy the next.  Marie was over the top happy. It must have been that Vegas sunshine. And Amy, she just came back from teaching in India. She told us a few times while clutching onto a cup of coffee. Both teachers were great and kept us inspired. \n\nA tip ~ if you're traveling bring a your own yoga towel if you have one. Rental mats and towels are a little expensive and if you're tall like me, the towel only covers about 60% of the mat. Traveling with a towel would have been easy to do.  Second, they don't offer baggies in the dressing room. All the other studios I've been to offer this. They are recycled bags or small garage bags. It's great to put your damp clothes into.

The three classes were pretty similar, except that the intro class had a sales pitch and the tough lotus class incorporated a flexible pole for resistance training.  \n\nThe hour-long class had the same structure as any other yoga class, the instructor remained in front and talked the class through/demonstrated the poses; students followed at their own pace.  It was private and non-judgmental, although the instructor would step in if someone was doing something dangerous.  Most of the class was spent doing standard yoga poses: forward folds, lunges, twists, standing splits, planks, hero's pose, etc.  The hammock was used for support, kind of like a ballet bar.  Towards the end of each class we would do a full inversion and hang suspended for a few minutes.  It was probably the best way to practice a handstand outside of actually having a partner there holding your feet.  Savasana was done either in the hammock or on the floor with feet elevated in the hammock, both versions were super relaxing.\n\nThe studio itself was nice: cool, low lighting, quiet part of the shopping center.  The instructors were professional and friendly.  The hammocks were well-maintained, and were switched out/washed between classes.  Yoga mats were provided for people who didn't bring their own.  \n\nI'm not very flexible, so the idea of supported yoga really appeals to me.  But, I think I would have to do this several times a week in order to see any real improvements, and at $12.40 per class it is a little out of my price range.  If the Groupon price (~$8) was the regular price or if I could buy a 1-month pass for say, $60, I would be all over it!

I will not be back however.  I have been practicing Hot Yoga for the past 3 years and generally practice at the Sumits Location in Chandler. I was enjoying the classes here, they are excellent beginner classes and a nice counter balance to the intense workout at Sumits. The flows are a little to fast with little time to perfect the postures though. The studio is clean and the environment around the studio is as well for the most part.  The reason I won't be back is because of the people I have encountered there. I know you can't blame a business for its customers but after meeting Karen the owner I think I know where the negative energy is emanating from. She walked up to me and introduced herself and asked how I was finding the class. I told her I was enjoying it and getting exactly what I needed out of it. That it was a very peaceful practice with alot of stretching and a nice counter balance to Sumits where I generally practice.  Now at this point Karen could have responded many diffrent ways...maybe \""Well Chad we are so happy you are giving us a try we hope you come back\"" Maybe something like that. This was her response..Mind you I just told her I LOVE Sumits and I have been practicing there for 2 years. So she says \""Well they have no air vents there. You can't breathe in their classes\"" said with a condescending tone and an air of arrogance. I replied \""well I really love practicing there and I have never had any trouble breathing\"" and she replies \""Well if you like to do yoga with no air than good for you\"" or something to that affect- I'm paraphrasing a little. Anyway...I was shocked. I was feeling VERY good after class and didn't really need someone, especially the owner inferring that my favorite place to practice Yoga sucks or that I simply don't know any better.  Now I'm not 100% sure but I'm guessing this woman is used to people telling her that her studio is incredible and gushing affection all over her. Maybe she's never had to deal with someone with a greater scope of experience giving a critical review maybe she's just a yogi poser who knows. Either way, I will not be back and I'm sure you can guess where you'll find me in the future. \n\n`CBAILEY",1.0,0.7587082386016846

The room was full of bro hugs and people who probably were all at some of the local bars last night with their crews.  I guess maybe the whole vibe is designed to be where Greek life kids go when they grow up. A grown up residence hall just isn't appealing to me. I'm a late 30s mom of two.

So now if you reserve a spot in class ahead of time and you're not there 10 minutes early (could be 5, they said both when they told me I couldn't come in), they give your spot to someone else who didn't bother to sign up.

When I got there, the instructor was someone other than who I had signed up for, but she said she taught the other ABC class, so I figured I'd just give it a go. Well, considering I didn't know ANYTHING about yoga, I was pretty upset that she didn't give much direction and didn't make any adjustments.

I wanted to take a class specifically for the INSTRUCTION that, you know, typically accompanies a CLASS setting - but there was none of that here. \n\nI left the class thinking that maybe she didn't say anything because I knew what I was doing, but when I attended a second class down the street at Metta Yoga, I realized I had been doing most of my poses wrong.

Not all studios teach in both but I can see why both French and English speaking yogis would enjoy her method of delivery. I can't get over the space of this place!

When the locker room door opens anyone in the hallway can see you in all your glory!\n3) The owners or management have decided to support an animal charity, which is admirable.

Well, yes, the clothes do tend to make women look amazing, but my reason is more personal. \n\nYou see, I'm 6'3\"", 200 lbs, and when I first started doing yoga I had a cheap, regular sized mat which meant that during class I had to readjust my place on the mat between every position and I couldn't get into any sort of flow. So, I talked to some people who had more yoga experience and they recommended that I try the Big Mat from Lululemon. The Big Mat is wider and longer than a regular mat and it has allowed me to actually enjoy yoga and get better at my practice.\n\nThe other problem I've always found is that gym clothes aren't often made for tall people.  In fact, one of my biggest pet peeves throughout the years has been the fact that most workout pants are too short. Luckily Lululemon is a Canadian company, so its men's clothing is designed for physically fit hockey players, many of whom are tall. (In fact some pants even say that they will work for hockey butt, i.e. the large glutes gained from constant skating). Lululemon pants come in 32-36\"" inseams. They fit and they continue to fit even after being washed.

I've been doing sumits, bikram and hot yoga for six years in Arizona and this by far has been my WORST experience!

Come to my second class and ask for a yoga/mat rental and they lady says sorry we don't have any more but I could buy one for more than 60 dollars!!!!! Any other studio would have opened one of their mats and added it to their rental collection or would have not even made the mistake in the first place of not providing sufficient rental equipment. At the very least she could have extended my trial membership by one day since I didn't get to attend class today. It was extremely annoying. When you're paying ridiculous amounts for classes they should accommodate you better. If this yoga studio is just in a convenient location for you and you have money to blow then it's ok, but if you're lookig for true value and great teachers and atmosphere then check out some of the other studios in the area. Lucky for you Scottsdale has a ton and this yoga studio doesn't offer anything you cant get somewhere else.\n\nAlso, most of their good reviews are from when they were a part of Sumits Yoga. I've been to a couple sumit yoga studios and loved it every time. They've parted ways with sumit as they don't carry the studio name anymore (made clear by the outline of letters torn off their store front) so don't be deceived by these reviews that stem from when they had a previous owner as this is not the same place anymore and clearly the new management is struggling to follow in sumit's footsteps.",0.0,0.9992660880088806

Huge bonus for the instructors making a point to know everyone's name to call out corrections and praise during class.  The stress of using class as a moving meditation really makes this an individual practice in the midst of the community.

There is also a small boutique with yoga wear, mats, DVD's, books, etc. I found the service very friendly, even to an anglophone with just passable French. Zero attitude and it was fun to practice my French. Changerooms are really nice and spa-like, with one shower and lots of lockers (but you need to bring your own lock).

Although it was entirely in French, I could follow along (I agree with Velma - the amount of French you need is inversely proportional to how much background you have in yoga). Josianne was a patient teacher with attention to detail. I also tried the Shakti Flow class on Sunday with Marjorie. I didn't really enjoy it as much, but that was partly my own misunderstanding of what the class would be. I usually do Ashtanga and i thought it would be a similar flow or vinyasa-type class. Shakti flow is actually more like Nia, fusing some aspects of yoga with pilates or dance. There was a lot of hip circles and waving our arms with our eyes closed, and it wasn't much of a workout for me.  \n\nIt is expensive at $18/class, but I got the $20 weekly pass for newbies so that wasn't so bad.

Typically, yoga studios have two mirrors, but three makes it a lot nicer.  Now, the biggest problem I have with the classroom is the floor.  It's laminate.  I understand that laminate floors are easy to clean, but topped with sweat and high humidity, it's extremely dangerous.
