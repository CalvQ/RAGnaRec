As an appetizer, we took some calamari that were good, but a bit salty. For the main plate, I took a filet mignon: the baking was good, but the lack of flavor upset me at a point where I had to use some pepper sauce. I never put any dressing when I'm eating a good piece of meat, so it's never a good thing when I'm doing it. Maybe I wasn't lucky, as I tasted the salmon tartar of my friend, and it was amazing.\n\nOne of the things that I liked in restaurant during summer, is their terrace. Hachoir don't have one, but they have wall size windows that make you feel like you were outside. It was perfect for yesterday cool, and windy evening.\n\nSo at the end, a good ambiance, in a good location, with some good food. I'll definitely give another try to this restaurant in a near future to get some good fish tartar.",1.0,0.9381518959999084

At first glance it looked like the place was expensive, and probably not going to be worth it, i was PROVED WRONG when they had a decently priced happy hour. I believe we spent 60 bucks for three people and came out satisfied. The food had great flavor(calamari, beef sticks, nachos, tacos, etc etc)\n\nI WILL eat here again when I'm back in town.",1.0,0.995195209980011

An authentic neighborhood restaurant with a good mix of oldies and country (hey it works!), great staff and really good food. The 3 $ in the yelp price guidelines is totally not true. It is what you would expect from a neighborhood place - great food, reasonable prices ( I would say super inexpensive for the quality of food), great staff and totally relaxing. And, although it says not good for dancing, you can if you want to.  I'll be back.",1.0,0.998035967350006

The standout of the evening was actually the drunken bread, which we gobbled up quite quickly. After that, the pasta primavera and chicken alfredo were just bland, and the sausage pizza was actually not good. They're going for the artisan/napoleon style (I think), but instead of being delicious and chewy, the crust was just soggy and limp. The cheese and sausage toppings were no better.\nIt's an ok place if you have no other option, but in downtown phx, you have many other options. I won't be returning.",0.0,0.9944756627082824
