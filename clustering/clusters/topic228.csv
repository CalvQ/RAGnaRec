I was really excited to try the Spa and in desperate need of a haircut so I called right away to make an appointment. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment, although 2 weeks away was on a Friday night.  I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?\n\nI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?\n\nHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.\n\nTo be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.

The consultation included a bridal hair style and bridal make up. I started with my hair style. I showed a picture of what I wanted and the stylist said she could deliver. The finished product was nothing like the photo I showed. I did not look or feel like a bride AT ALL. While the stylist was nice, she proceeded to tell me how she went out the night before to an event with an open bar. It wasn't the most professional but I guess I wouldn't have minded had my hair turned out how I wanted. \n\nMy makeup artist was very nice and has been there for many years. I loved the way my skin looked however my eyes and lips turned out nothing like my inspiration picture. I showed a picture with gold/nude tones and said I typically wear those colors and walked away with purple eyeshadow. The eyeliner was heavy on the upper and lower lids which is also very different from my usual makeup routine and idea of my wedding day makeup. \n\nI gave it all a chance and went home to see my fianc\u00e9's reaction. He said the hair was really bad, not classy or elegant at all. He said I didn't even look like myself with the way my makeup was done. Needless to say I took my hair down and makeup off immediately. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was so upset and noticed that I was clearly upset that he called them. I'm not sure what the conversation consisted of with the director of the spa (yes, director) but he did say they attempted to put it back on me at first. After some back and forth he was told I'd receive a full refund. I haven't checked to see if the refund has been given as it has been less than 48 hours. So we'll see how that goes.\n\nI won't be going there again for any services. Thank goodness for a trial appointment or else my wedding day would have been absolutely ruined.",0.0,0.9981533885002136

I got ahold of someone on the phone at MAC and told her my problem.  She not only offered to get me in ASAP for a new trial (at my request), but she tentatively reserved my whole bridal party for the morning of the wedding day.  \n\nI showed up for my trial, and Gabi took a few moments to get to know my usual makeup routine and likes/dislikes.  She was tatted up but stylish-exactly as I picture a \""hip\"" makeup artist- and super bubbly and excited.  It was such a contrast to my previous makeup artist that I felt so much more confident in her ability.  She proved me right with every decision... she gently urged me out of my comfort zones on the areas she felt would benefit, and respected my wishes and desire to lean toward the subtle overall.  I was sold when she drew on my eyeliner... a perfect, straight, unwavering, even line.  \n\nThe result was amazing.  I looked like myself, not like I was painted, but just a glowing, blemish-free, accented version.  I purchased the eyelashes that were on my face and confirmed appointments for the wedding day.\n\nMost of my bridal party got their makeup done here, and though I wasn't present for most of them, they all looked beautiful.  Same thing - they looked like themselves, but picture ready!  Gabi did a great job remembering what she had done before, and my makeup turned out just as it did at the trial.  \n\nOur appointments were between 11am and 1pm, and the wedding started at 4.  We didn't leave until midnight and the makeup held up the entire 12 hours.  No smudging, no wearing off, not even the eyelashes fell off (they did get loose when a toddler grabbed on, but it wasn't a loss)!  And it photographed so well.  All my pictures are awesome.  I'm a super happy camper, and can't be happier that I cancelled my original choice and went with my gut.",1.0,0.9983221888542176

Besides kicking myself for not following my gut feeling of doing my own makeup (I was a bride and I wanted to be pampered) I'm still trying to figure out how it is I'm that one bride with the one negative review from so many others who have had raved reviews. I just don't get it...But on with the review...Let me start with Megan who I have to say from the moment I inquired about their services, responds to emails lightening fast and makes you feel as though you've known each other for years. The day of my wedding Celina (makeup) and Courtney (hair) show up on time, start setting up and I show them both pics of what I have in mind for my hair and makeup. Courtney did my hair better than any pic I showed her and nailed it perfectly. I LOVED my hair and it stayed in place all night. As Courtney was doing my hair, Celina was doing my makeup (I requested a sexy smokey eye) and from talking to her the day before going over what I wanted and didn't want, I had felt confident she would nail it and got what I wanted. As soon as she told me to look into the mirror, that confidence quickly turned to horror and the only words I could utter out were 'Oh sh#t' because my worst nightmare had come true. I looked like the bride of Frankenstein with heavy, black, uneven, blotchy eyeshadow from my eyelid all the way to my brows! My brows, which I pencil and shape in, were not even with eachother, drawn in thin and all blotched.  The airbrush makeup was not as great as I had read about either. I could see up close it looked all caked and dried out. I also thought it was transfer resistant? At the end of the night when I removed my dress (she airbrushed my chest, which also had caked dried blotches near my collarbone) there was all makeup on my dress (on the inside) in the bust area. Now, they showed up at 1 p.m. and the limo was picking us up at 3 pm and here it is 2:40 pm and I'm trying to undo what I could of what she did while crying and shaking! Because of this, I missed being able to do my first look photos and had to rush getting into my dress and getting to the limo who had been waiting now until 3:15! This was by far not the experience I had paid for or wanted or even expected for that matter with all the rave reviews. I did email Megan the next day with my complaint, she was understanding and she did give me what I feel was a 'partial' refund of $75.00 for the makeup. I feel what I had to go through should have been more than that (I paid $250). My advice is do a trial so you avoid going through what I did and can have great memories of getting ready and riding off to the chapel happy and not all stressed out and disappointed :(",0.0,0.9960377216339112

They knew the exact look I was going for! If you want a hairstyle that probably wont look good on you Michelle will let you know. Be prepared with at least two different styles that you want. She can do any and every style so don't be scurred! I was so impressed with the love and dedication Michelle and Irina put into their specialties. They are very talented at what they do!\n\nI got so many compliments and felt so sexy and confident on my big day thanks to Irina and Michelle!\n\nOn a side note: I feel like such an idiot because after all of their hard work I forgot to tip them!

What is the point of spending money and time for a trial if someone I have never met ends up just winging it the morning of the event?  The woman who did my hair in the trial was the same woman who did my hair on my wedding day; however, she looked at me and queried, \""How did I do your hair again during the trial?\""  Again, it is her professional responsibility to work with the client and remember what we had decided.  My hair did turn out pretty, but it was completely different from the day of the trial.  Although it was beautiful, it went quite flat and when I look at pictures, I notice that there were sections she simply did not curl.   \n\nProblem 2: She said she would arrive with her two \""assistants\"" to help with the rather large bridal party.  By \""assistant,\"" she meant her pre-teen daughter.  That's right. . .she brought her daughter who is in Junior High to do hair!  Her daughter was very sweet and well-mannered, but we would have been better off keeping our cash and doing our own hair.  The second \""assistant\"" was her sister.  I do not believe she has any professional expertise or training.  \n\nProblem 3: Three of my bridesmaids had to re-do their hair.  The only skill these women seemed to have mastered is the curling iron.  Yet, the curls went flat within a couple of hours.  One of my bridesmaid's asked her to touch up the flattened curls, to which the \""hair artist,\"" retorted, \""Your hair just isn't the kind of hair that will curl.\""  My bridesmaid has beautiful, lush wavy hair.\n\nIf you are looking to save money with this as an alternative to other pricier travel make-up artists or a salon, my advice is to keep the money and recruit girlfriends or relatives to do your make-up/hair.  It's about the same level of professionalism, service and expertise.  This is the ONLY thing I would have changed about my wedding.",0.0,0.9989596605300904

This year, (almost every year to be honest) we booked a 3 night stay in Las Vegas, and planned out Halloween parties for all 3 nights. Wanting to go big for the actual holiday, we contacted Lei V to inquire about having a professional paint our faces with sugar skulls to celebrate the evening. After a quick back and forth email, and a small deposit placed through PayPal, we had booked Angie Lum as our makeup artist for the evening. \n\nAs a guy, I had a bit of a sticker shock about the price... initially, but when I heard she was going to bring all her own supplies to our hotel room to do our makeup, my mind started to change as that was very convenient for two people that don't like to be dragged away from the action while in Vegas. Now, not to spoil the punch line, but you should know that I was so pleased with the job she had done that the price now seemed too little, so I threw in a tip... yes the makeup was that good.\n\nAngie did my makeup first, and she was very sweet, professional, and patient. She always seemed to know exactly how certain \""makeup\"" things might bother me, (being that I never wear makeup) and she was able to give me little tips on how to easily deal with things like a sharp looking brush being run across the inner of my eye lid, awwww! She even at one point did my eye line in sections to alleviate my strain. \n\nSo fast forward the night, our makeup is done and we hit casino party on our way over to the Calvin Harris set at club Hakkassan. After a few drinks, I could not count the number of compliments and pictures we had taken by fellow party goers. So when the Yelp questionnaire asks would I book this service again, I can honestly say that we received so many compliments that we actually tried to book her again for the Day of the Dead party the next night! \n\nThanks so much, we had a blast!",1.0,0.9408559799194336

Overall, I suppose they got the job done for having never had a preliminary trial run. I came to Las Vegas for my November wedding. Unfortunately I wasn't going to be in LV long enough to have a trial run for hair/makeup before our big day, so I booked Amelia C based on Yelp reviews. A 5/5 rating! Wow! Unfortunately the service was not exactly worthy of the 5/5 starts. \n\nI was totally psyched about my wedding day from beginning to end except for the way that my makeup looked. In hindsight, that would have been the one thing I would have changed. I am very particular about my makeup and had contacted Amelia C & Co before booking to find out if they had artists who were good at makeup for Asian eyes. I was assured that the artist would do a great job. She didn't :(, my eyebrows were horrible, my foundation washed me out in all of my photos, and my lip color faded after the first hour. The only thing that stayed put were my eyelashes and too-dark eyeliner. \n\nIt was only weeks after our wedding that my bridesmaids finally told me how rude Amelia was to them, almost condescending. You know its bad when it's coming from a bunch of east coasters who are used to a little ball-busting. They also told me that they all felt rushed and none of them got the look that they had asked for. I held off on writing this review because I understand what it is like to promote your business, however I eventually thought it necessary to write an HONEST review. Having worked in the beauty industry for several years, I know the importance of customer service and making your customers feel comfortable. Unfortunately, our experience with Amelia, that day, did not fit the mold. \n\nThe only saving grace for this review was our hairdresser. Our hair looked great and stayed in place all day/night long. In addition to great work, our hairdresser was extremely personable and made us feel comfortable despite our discomfort in the makeup chair. \n\nI would definitely suggest Amelia C & Co for the makeup novice, as they do an adequate job for any event.......however if you are experienced in makeup and hair, you should DEFINITELY have a trial run beforehand, because without one-the results may not be as expected.",0.0,0.9845853447914124

I made this mistake and booked with them. Although everyone is very nice and professional, I was quite disappointed with the hair and makeup done by Melissa. \n\nThe appointment was for an in-room wedding makeup and hair session at the Bellagio. I was told that the makeup artist would arrive 15 min prior to the appointment time which should have been 12:45, but Melissa came just a couple minutes past 1pm. No biggie, but I felt it was quite rushed for her to do both makeup and hair by 3pm. \n\nI told her of my previous poor experience of getting makeup done that made me have dark black eyeliner and dark eyebrows that made me look old, and she assured me she is much better. So I was quite shocked and disappointed when I look 10 years older when she was done. The eyeliner was also uneven when I checked after she left. There were gaps in between the fake individual eyelashes that she had put on. \n\nFor the hair, I told her to leave strands of hair to frame my face to make it less round, and she made a big curl with my side bangs on the left side, which got into my eye and face in most of the wedding shots in a big clump. Then on the right side she pulled my hair back which made my face look bigger. \n\nI really wish to have just done my own makeup. After the wedding I asked my friends, and they commented that the makeup made me look older and more Asian with the dark eyeliner. Even my mom told me I look better when I do my own makeup and hair. It was quite clear that the makeup was too heavy in close up photos. It looked very unnatural. I had also thought there would be airbrush foundation. \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the customer service and friendliness of the staff so I was hesitant to write this review. Nevertheless, after looking through the professional photos for the wedding, I was quite disappointed with the makeup and hair. I want to clarify again that I do not recommend this company for women of Asian features because it's quite difficult to get the makeup right. This makeup company still is very reputable and professional, but unfortunately they do not know how to do makeup for Asians.",0.0,0.999330997467041

She did the make-up for a wedding I did the hair for. \n\nJena's make-up application for the bride, the brides mother and her 4 bridesmaids was classic yet modern. Everyone was glowing and their eyes stood out beautifully, especially the bride. She gave them exactly what every women wants on their wedding day, to look gorgeous and flawless. \n\nI would highly recommend Jena to anyone and here's why:\n\n1) She is a true professional!\n\n2) She asks questions and makes suggestions. \n\n3) She's prepared and works in a timely manner. \n\n4) Her make-up application enhances her clients beauty without being overly done.\n\n5) She is sweet and personable. \n\nI hope to get to work with her in the future and would feel comfortable knowing my own clients are in excellent hands with Jena.",1.0,0.9998303651809692
