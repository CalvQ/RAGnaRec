Upon looking at reviews I found Presidential Limousine. Let me just say the reviews say it all! Clean, timely and professional. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about our driver Steve. I looked at my watch as we walked out the door of our hotel and here comes our limo, not a minute late! We had a bit of time from when we were picked up to where we needed to be dropped off so without saying a word Steve pulls up to the Bellagio so we could watch the water show and take pictures to kill some time. Very thoughtful! We arrived to our destination right on time and Steve explained that he would be right at the door when the show was finished. Sure enough, he saw us coming and walked around the limo to open the door just as we walked up. The rest of the night continued in the same fashion. \n\nI was VERY impressed and haven't stopped talking about Steve and Presidential Limo! If I ever find myself in Vegas and needing a limo again, Presidential Limo all the way!",1.0,0.9969292283058168

Well, don't GO HERE unless you want to get screwed, no pun intended.  Voted the Best Strip Club in Las Vegas....uhh doubt it.\n\nThis was my first time and probably will be my last time here.  2 Floors.  Sausage fest for the bachelorettes upstairs and what seemed like approximately 88% Southeastern asian chicks downstairs.  The other 12% were of the non-white variety.

My response was \""GFY and no your not taking my camera!\""\n\nWhat sucked was I never got to buy my buddy a dance here, but I got a pretty detailed report about the debauchery (i'll spare you those details) and shadiness after I got the boot from the fellas.  Apparently everybody saw the one of the dancers just blatantly grab a fresh bottle of GG from our table and just run off with it.  The manager accused my buddy of lying about the incident and the dancer finally fessed up and apologized.  But when it was all said and done.....they replaced it with a bottle of Absolut....WTF kinda BS is this?!?\n\nYes the hummer limo ride was free and so was the cover...but it's still \""slim pickings\"" at OG.

We got the free limo ride from the hotel hook up which was fine and I guess a nice touch.  We were already pretty drunk at this point and the limo driver was kind enough to let us bring our champagne bottle with straws in it into the limo.  The woman taking our money when we got to the club was not so kind.  Cue four girls chugging champagne in a ghetto parking lot in Vegas.  I think we paid $20 to get in but then were told we also had a two drink minimum we had to meet.  I think I ordered a $12 screwdriver which was watered down and weak.  Two sips in I was determined to not get another drink there so I nursed that one for the next couple hours.  \n\nThe vibe here was weird.  We started out on the first level with the ladies and almost all the men that were there were sitting far away from the stage and not tipping.  Rude.  We sat in the tipping aisle and got a very kind reception from the girls.  The girls were cute but not super hot, but they made up for it in talent.  Most of my tipping money went to them because I was just so impressed with the acrobatics.  They showed us a great time.  \n\nEventually we ventured upstairs the the male stripper section.  It was a bachelorette party after all.  I was instantly uncomfortable.  Only one of the six or so guys was even remotely attractive but that quickly doesn't matter when you see the corny costumes and witness the floor humping.  We all got roped into getting lap dances and honestly, I would have rather had a dance from one of the girls downstairs.  We decided that this was a total mess so we just decided to go with it.  We were pretty much openly making fun of them and at one point my sister started giving my friends dances because honestly, she's more talented than the guys were.  (FYI she's NOT a stripper).  The manager came over and told us we couldn't dance up there.  REALLY?  Were we really competition for the guys?  Was he really worried that the other bachelorette parties there were going to start paying us instead of the guys?  Ridiculous.  \n\nOverall we had a fun time, but that was probably because we're awesome and can have fun almost anywhere.  I definitely don't recommend it for male strippers but it's ok for the girls.  We did get a ride back to the hotel afterwards and spent half the ride drunkenly begging and trying to bribe the driver to take us to McDonalds.  He kept refusing and finally said, \""You know you have a McDonalds in your hotel, right?\""  Good game, sir.  Good game.",0.0,0.7644185423851013

I've been to quite a few strip clubs in my lifetime and this one is at the bottom of the list.  I've never been to a strip club which didn't even peak my interest!  I would never want to go to Spearmint Rhino AGAIN!  Why?  Read the following . . .\n\nSo my friends and I entered in the establishment with my hopes up high since I've heard such great things.  We had to check in our cameras at the door, which is understandable.  Once we walked in, there is a bar to the left with a small stage.  Instead of making a left, you can go straight forward and there is a large stage with a bar to the right.  If you go further down the room, there is another bar with a few small stages.  Here's why I would never want to go there again!\n\nThe girls there are not that attractive (or at least as attractive as I thought they would be), the venue is almost pitch black (which makes it more difficult to determine whether a girl is hot or not), there is a \""western saloon\"" feel to the place, no neon lights (which is a standard for great strip clubs), absurdly over-crowded, you have to pay to sit in a chair (yes, you heard me right, you have to pay to sit down) and you will have a bouncer that will constantly bug you that you have to keep on walking and there is no standing allowed!  WTF is up with that?  I have been to slummy strip clubs such as Garden of Eden in SF and I'd rather go there than Spearmint Rhino.  \n\nI would not go to Spearmint Rhino again!  The only reason why I didn't give them the whole one star review was because the girls weren't that bad looking.  I say 70% of the girls were cute.  If the Hustler Club in SF had those girls in their club, I would be homeless.  As Martha Stewart says, \""It's a good thing.\""",0.0,0.998342990875244

I was dragged here by a villainous lady friend that we'll call Sue one Saturday night. Alright, to be fair I was curious so I wasn't putting up much of a fight.\n\nBig burly men keep asking you for money as you make your way up the stairs through a series of dark rooms until you finally make it into the club. There you are strong-armed into buying expensive crappy beer every twenty minutes or so by impatient waitresses.\n\nAt first things were fine and we discussed the political sexuality of the strip club and the surprising diversity of body types with the dancers. I was surprised to see many of the patrons were groups of young men and women. The clientele isn't nearly as sketchy as the place was which is good.\n\nSue doesn't drink but waitresses kept coming by to make sure we were buying drinks so we wouldn't get kicked out. Being against wastefulness and being more than a little nervous I drank it all. All that cheap beer hit me at once.\n\nNext thing you know I am tearfully telling Sue all about losing the love of my life (which apparently is my first girlfriend). I think Sue may have offered to buy me a lap dance or at least go halfsies on one in an effort to cheer me up. I don't think I could hear her over my tipsy self-flagellation. I am lucky Sue even talks to me anymore.\n\nSo why one star? I don't know if it is normal strip club etiquette to be constantly shaken down for money. But at times employees and waitresses were downright rude about it. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by a tacky business model in what is at the very least a tacky industry. But somehow I still was. I don't think it helped that none of the girls could really dance.",0.0,0.997077465057373

Our party bus dropped us off in front and drove away- then we realized that Firehouse was closed for a private event until later that evening....so while someone called the driver to come back, the majority of our party went into Embury to get a drink in the meantime. \n   Now I understand what the vibe is here, and I understand that the drinks are often complex and somewhat time consuming to mix. I also get it that we were \""That Bachelorette Party\"" of 20 chicks, including my friend's older, rowdy, Yinzer Aunts. \n    However, the guy bartending was so incredibly rude, it was unreal. I've been in the service industry for over 12 years and I've never seen anything to this caliber. His tone was condescending, the smirk on his face was ridiculous, and he basically told us that since the drinks are specialty cocktails it would take an exorbitant amount of time so we should just leave. Feeling like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, we did. \n\n  He had the capability to make that situation work in his favor- so think of a quick shot, or an easy drink, or even suggest the MILLER LITE that I see is listed on their menu. (oh the irony) He could have easily made a quick $50 on us during the 20 minutes it took the driver to return. Not cool, dude.",0.0,0.9978026747703552

I get to be first to review this strip club! I've been a few times, and I hope not to miss anything.\n\nOnyx is apart of the Rick's Cabaret chain of strip clubs all over the USA. As you may guess, the Onyx clubs are geared toward urban, or black customers who want better entertainment. \n\nIt is a pretty spacious club, with a separate bar area away from the stages and couches. I guess people can go there to get a little break from all the T&A action and music? I don't know why anyone would but it's there if you need it.\n\nThey do serve food, and I've heard from a few different people that the wings are really good. I don't want to eat at a strip club personally so I can't say for sure.\n\nThe chairs are all pretty comfy, and they face a big main stage flanked by two mirrors. There is an elevated couch area that I presume is VIP only. I haven't elevated myself to that status yet so I sat in the main area with most of the other patrons. Almost every time I have been to this club, there have been almost the same amount of women as men watching the dancers. So if you are the type of guy annoyed by that, you may want to steer clear. I'm talking groups of 4,5 women coming into the club together. Other than that, there are couples or what looks to be mixed groups of friends. The single men or groups of men seem to be outnumbered on the evenings I've gone.\n\nNow, for the talent. I will say that out of all the clubs I have been to up and down the East Coast, this club has a very good standard for hiring, which I hear they stick to. With the exception of Miami, Atlanta and perhaps Sue's Rendezous in the NYC area, Onyx has some pretty well shaped/groomed dancers. Pretty impressive for a city like Charlotte.\n\nThe dancers are mostly black/American, but there were Indian and Asian mixed in the line up too. Most of all the dancers where slim and in shape, with about 3 or 4 on both sides of that spectrum. As to be expected, the weekend line up is more varied and even more stunning than in the week.\n\nI plan to be a regular at this place. :)",1.0,0.9951783418655396

Super cool. My group of friends are in our early 20's and an attractive bunch and go to Mabel's quite a bit so we walk up only to have the doorman turn his back to us and avoid us for a while; keep in mind there is no line at all and considering the 45 yr olds and strippers had just left the building we figured they would want a group of young attractive people in Mabel's but guess not. The bouncer turned around and says \""Can I help you?\"" like he is the bouncer of some exclusive club in NYC or LA but the big, bald, fat bouncer needs a reality check and should realize he works at a small place with a random location, with expensive drinks and isn't the only place available in Old Town. So he goes on to tell us you must be a \""MEMBER\"" OR ON THE VIP LIST to get in...gag me. Really Mabel's? A member at Mabel's wow...you guys are feeling a bit cocky eh?! Kinda sad because I use to recommend Mabel's to a lot of people and said what a cool place it was...I will never recommend anyone to go to this place ever again. We are people that come to Mabel's a lot and you just lost a good amount of business. \n\nI've never been treated so rude before at a bar and truly hope someone from Mabel's reads this and changes their ways.
