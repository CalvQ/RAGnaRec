The pitcher didn't save us any money at all which we all found strange - next time we'll just get our own glass I guess. The Margarita's were good though.\n\nThe food was good but the service was so-so...our friends said the service is usually much better and that the waitress may be new since they had never seen her before (we sat on the bar side). I won't really hold the slow service against them too much right now.\n\nSo based on my first experience I'll give them 3-Stars; however, we will go again and possibly revise to 4-Star based on the feedback from friends.",0.0,0.9684651494026184

Our female waiter was upset that we moved, I could tell by her attitude. To make story short, we were kicked out of the place because we complained about the waiter.

No answer, no message, no online web form, basically - no way to contact them.  So we went early to grab some tables.  The wait staff said, \""no problem, glad to have you.\""  But they (two girls who were sisters) quickly mixed up orders, didn't bring drinks out, went missing for extending periods of time (only to come back from an obvious smoke break), and were unreliable.  Our group could really only succeed in getting a drink by going up to the bar and ordering one on their own.\n\nAvailability:\nSo there is about a 20 page menu of glorious beers at the Beer Market.  Almost any thing you can think of they have it ON THE MENU.  Yes, on the menu, but not in reality.  I kid you not that my friend went through FIVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS before they actually had one in stock that she wanted.  If you don't have it available, take it off the menu.  One or two, ok, but FIVE in a ROW, I don't think so.  And this happened over and over again as the night went on.\n\nWill I be back?  Likely because it is a big open place where you can order take out and sit around with your friends and hopefully order a hard to find beer.  Location, next to PNC Park, also makes it a draw.
