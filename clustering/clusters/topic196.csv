Sounded good and I was in town so I thought I'd give it a shot! I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn't have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn't take long to come out...\n\nSo I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don't ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \""beer.\"") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries.

My sandwich was the pulled pork which was good but a bit dry.

My side was cole slaw, which surprised my brother-in-law.  With all the great other choices, why would you order cole slaw, he wondered?  Because I love it , and the Honey Bear's slaw was great.

We told the waitress about the cold meat and in as professional a manner as I've ever seen she removed it and apologized. Forward 5 minutes she returns with my second prime rib. I touched the top and it was minimally warmer, although the plate was so hot it couldn't be touched. Cut into this one and again barely warm. I now asked for the chef knowing some line cook had plated my food. Who appears? The owner. I explained my concerns and on the third try received a warmer, still not hot piece of meat. By now the serving and returning had spanned about 20 minutes, I had already finished most of my baked potato and just wanted to leave. So after ordering two end cuts we ended up with inside cuts and more frustration than needed. They knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink. Simply stated, I'll never return.

Lovely patio atmosphere in Old Town, the service was quite good and we were able to have a very relaxing dinner.  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait for a patio table.  I give the menu some points for trying to be inventive - I had the Pollo Margarita, as did my partner, and it was fine, but I understand why people criticize the food for being a bit on the bland side.  My brother in law had the meatloaf with chipotle sauce (he's the culinary guy in the group) and he was quite pleased with it.

She didn't seem familiar with the offer, but didn't question it at all and brought me one.  In case you're wondering, it's a personal sized piece of bread that comes in a little round bowl and resembles a large cupcake.  I got the cinnamon-raisin one and it was definitely the best part of my dining experience.  The top was just a little toasted and the middle was soft and chewy.

I balked at first--I was dressed casually and had heard that this was a fancy place--but he insisted.  I'm glad that he did.\n\nOur server was very pleasant, knowledgeable and professional, and offered a few suggestions of dishes to order.  On her recommendation, I tried the vegetarian French onion soup.  It was a bit too salty, but as a vegetarian, I appreciated being able to have French onion soup for once--most places use beef broth.  I tried my brother's beet salad, which was delicious.\n\nWhile it's true that Sonoma doesn't offer a bread basket, I think it's better this way.  You don't go to a restaurant to fill up on bread.  The bread that you do get (you get your choice of two) is delicious.  I enjoyed a slice of the ciabatta and a slice of the raisin walnut.  The herbs really come through nicely in the infused oil served with the bread.\n\nAs my entree, I had the grilled vegetable gyro, with a side of fruit (the other option was fries).  The vegetables in the gyro were very fresh, and I liked that the flatbread was grilled, too.  My one suggestion would be either to provide a larger size flatbread, or a second flatbread, because there was more filling than flatbread.  The fruit was blah--the melon and grape mix you see at cafeterias--not quite the quality you expect from a \""farm to table\"" restaurant.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the ice cream sandwich trio.  One sandwich was made from gingersnap cookies with coffee ice cream, another was shortbread with chocolate ice cream, and the third was snickerdoodle with pumpkin ice cream.  Happiness.\n\nIf you put quantity over quality when it comes to food, Sonoma's probably not the best bet for you; the portions are reasonable but not oversized.

The place was pretty quite and there were only maybe a dozen people in there which was perfect for us.\n\nThe Italian soda was pretty expensive, my fiance had 2 at $4 each, compared to the Thursday date night special of dinner for 2 for only $25 but she liked her soda and they charge the same price at an Italian chain we go to too so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. They got us a second serving of their bread. Their desert was pretty amazing, chain restaurants don't work very hard at presentation but we were very impressed with how our appetizer looked. \n\nRich: That's how everything tasted and it was incredible. The appetizer, the entrees and the desert were all very rich and while I'm sure it wasn't healthy it sure was good. \n\nMy only other gripe was our chicken bistro, while the pasta and chicken were good, it had WAY too much onion in it, after we'd eaten all the pasta and chicken it was still a half full plate of onions.  We couldn't even finish our desert we had so much. \n\nI was very happy with the food and service, and if not for the soda we would have probably paid under $35 including tip which again is around the same price as a lot of chains if not less AND the food had way more flavor. I think we'll definitely come back on another Thursday and try some more of their stuff.

Easy check in, easy parking easy EVERYTHING.   The staff here is awesome, efficient, always helpful.

They had an \""add-on\"" list posted at the register, which prompted me to quickly add 3 for $.99. I also had the option of adding those items to my salad, on the side, and either steamed,raw, or wok-tossed.  I chose Broccoli, Mushrooms and Carrots, wok-tossed, on the side.\n  My brother went with the Spicy Japanese Noodles, add Beef.  At that time another staff member walked up and offered my brother a house salad, free of charge, as he had \""made an extra,\"" my brother happily accepted.  We added two waters and our total came to $15.14.  We took our cups, and our number card.   It was self service as far as beverages, straws, napkins, etc.  We got our drinks, chose our table and the food followed shortly, within 3 minutes.  I was surprised when i saw my salad.  I ordered the half, yet this was not a tiny salad.  I cant imagine have gotten the regular order, then again, I wasn't starving.  I also got my veggies on the side.  My brother received a decent bowl of noodles, which smelled great.  \n   My salad was crisp, fresh, and I loved the dressing.  My side of veggies were done well.  They were lightly cooked which softened them, yet still retained that crunch.  My brother was equally as pleased.  I am not a spice, or meat fan, but I did taste his noodles. They were on the mild side of spice, which I liked, and had a great flavor!  \n    Overall, great experience at Nothing but Noodles, and will definitely return!  The staff were great and more attentive than expected at this style of restaurant.",1.0,0.9981350898742676

We both had ribs which were fall off the bone done but maybe a little over done since they were pretty dry. My sister in law had the rib eye and lobster. She said the lobster which was pretty small was good but she almost sent the steak back because of saltiness and sinew.

We had reservations because we were a big party, so we didn't wait long. There were, however, quite a few people waiting for a while after we sat down. It was your typical north Scottsdale crowd. Every woman looked the same and every guy looked like a DB. \n\nThe food. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. It's hard to mess up. Had a couple of Dos Equis which they had on tap. They came out promptly and cold. I ordered the Carnitas tacos. They came with rice and beans. There were two tacos and you have a choice of tortilla. They were pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular. The black beans I had were good, but the rice was just like buttered white rice that someone mentioned in a previous review. My brother had the machaca burrito which was huge and he seemed to enjoy. \n\nA couple of funny anecdotes. I think we had runners bring food for other tables to ours about 3 times. They seemed a little lost all night. Later on when the right food came, my brother asked the runner which of the two identical burritos was chicken and which was beef. The runner said, and I quote, \""Dude, they just give me the food and tell me where to take it.\"" No effing joke! \n\nOverall, you could probably skip this place and come back when it changes to some other ethnic-type food place in a year.",0.0,0.9627411365509032

Sorry Yelp, you let us down a bit. On the plus side, the cocktail menu is huge, and the bartender is quite talented. I had a terrific Sazerac. On the other hand, the vibe is very snooty (wine and cocktail list are presented on an ipad, which is a cute gimmick, but kind of a pain to flip through), and the servers were as well. The food menu is quite limited and the cuisine was all heavy meat. My brother and I are vegetarian and they didn't have a single vegetarian entree. I muttered to him that, if the chef is good, he could whip something up, and the waitress overhead and chimed in, \""he is very good\"". No he's not. The recommended appetizer was a slow poached egg with potato and shaved black truffle--sounded fantastic, but the flavors were way off. Somewhere between an ashtray and used cat litter. The special entree was no better and not filling either. The chef seems to heavily favor bitter, smokey, and highly acidic flavors and food was not balanced and totally lacking in seasoning. Coming from Northern California, where there are lots of great, great restaurants, it was painful to spend this much money on a meal that was so mediocre. I suppose if the idea of a $120 steak with bone marrow is your thing, then maybe this is your restaurant (although those who ordered it weren't raving about it).

The menu looked promising and we had moderate expectations given that this was a new hotel of the MGM Mirage group that would likely have some experience with pushing food at buffets - but we were sadly, sadly disappointed.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nFirst off, there the buffet line and stations are very utilitarian and remind you of a cafeteria - not a whole lot of good interior design went into designing this space and they wanted to seat us literally a yard away from the the entrance/exit with no barriers between the oncoming traffic. We requested another table and they were kind enough to oblige us.\n\nHowever, getting to the food - there were long lines for the \""seafood\"" section - in which case only shrimp and crab legs were served. Just as we were approaching to serve ourselves - the trays were refilled with literally ROCK HARD FROZEN seafood - inedible, crusty with ice crystals. Even once you let it defrost - it was waterlogged, soggy, mushy and tasteless. \n\nThere were two or three carving stations. One with an Indian-style (tandoori?) tri tip or a flatter-style steak where they'd carve you a single small strip and expect you to go on your merry way. The prime rib was cooked beyond well-done. The asian dishes were sub-par as well (wonton soup - the won tons were doughy, undercooked, and the kind with the super thick wrappers that you know no real establishment that caters to the Chinese would serve)\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nMy highlight of the night was taking the tikka masala sauce (and passing on the dry sinewy chicken that soaking in it) and mixing it into bowls of basmati rice... mmm so good!!!! This literally saved my meal and stopped me from good-flavor-starvation. But definitely not what I should've paid for. The flank steak was wonderful with the garlicy/oniony topping.

The fries and bread that it was on weren't the best, but the meat was amazing.\n\nOverall, I think this place has the potential of being a four or five star barbecue joint, but only after they spend some time decorating, getting their new staff on the same page, and working out the kinks. I will be going back in a month to give it another whirl.",1.0,0.9926761984825134

Once the rest of the crew arrived, we ordered more food and drink, but it took a really long time for the drinks to arrive and our orders came at different times.  We split three salads amongst the six of us and had a few orders of fries (sweet potato and regular) and two wraps.  The food was not amazing, but it was decent and moderately priced.  The sweet potato fries blew the regular crinkle cut fries away.\n\nDespite being full, Joey noticed that we were celebrating a birthday (Jared's), and generously brought out a box of Krispy Kreme donuts.  I later learned that the owner of BFC also owns the Krispy Kreme donut franchise next door... bonus for donut lovers!\n\nOverall, this place was A-OK - especially considering they just opened earlier this month.

Very elegant yet pretty laid back.\n\nThey started my bro and I with a refreshing gazpacho and some hummus.  For appetizers, he got the shrimp ceviche while I got the crab and corn chowder.  Both appetizers were delicious and the portion sizes were small enough for the sauvignon blanc wine pairing that went with both of our appetizers.  For the main course, the restaurant paired our dishes with another glass of wine (pinot noir for him and and a cabernet sauvignon for me).  For the dish he got the green gazpacho salmon while I got the skirt steak with artichoke potatoes.  Wow.  Both paired wonderfully with the selected wines and the vegetables worked into both dishes in such a way that they both had a good clean flavor to both of them.  For dessert we both got a dessert sampler including a fruit tart, chocolate/peanut butter flan, and a squash cupcake with sweet cream.  The cupcake wasn't really my taste, but the flan and tart were both excellent.  In the end our stomachs were both full (but not explosive fortunately).  The portions for each course were manageable and elegantly prepared.  And the staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  \n\nLastly, a HUGE thumbs up to them for giving us coupons to come back again before the end of the year.  They offered this to everyone who came for Restaurant Week.  I had already planned on coming back again, but this made that all the more certain.

After he mistook a sign of a girl on a cake for baked goods, I suggested we hit up Drago Sisters after a Soyo lunch.\n\nI can't say that the Drago Sisters Bakery visit was a selfless one - I had been meaning to try them for months. When we walked in, I witnessed David S. go from a calm man to jumping in between the two displays - naming everything in sight as a suggestion for purchase. No way honey, my waistline does not work that way. \n\nWe ultimately ended up with two petit-fours (Gingerbread and Pumpkin), an eclair, and a mini tres leches cake. My brother and I have no patience, nor do we pretend to - evident as he asked for two forks so we may attack these sugary treats in the parking lot. The petit-fours were absolutely delicious and flavorful. Moist, dense, and packed with spice, these two made fondant enticing for a girl with an aversion towards it. The tres leches cake was fluffy yet moist - brimming with flavor in each bite. Then there's the eclair. Oh god, dark chocolate atop and the subtle, decadent custard filling made it to die for.\n\nFive minutes later, we had finished all four desserts. Yet, we were still puzzled as to which one was the best. When you pick a spectrum of desserts, one always fails to meet the standard of the others. Oh, they don't play that game at Drago Sisters. It seems as though they prefer to sabotage your waistline by making everything incredibly heavenly.",1.0,0.9665122032165528

There was a particular one I was interested in  but the side was sweet potatoes. I'm not too fond of sweet potatoes so I kept searching. I decided on the 16 oz Rib eye ($36.00) we were at a steak house so I thought, \""Why not\""!?\"" The steak was nicely done I loved how juicy it was. It came with smoked Cheddar Polenta Fries , roasted broccoli that was served with a side of Poblano Demi Cream sauce. The fries were fried to a golden brown and they tasted okay. My brother liked them better than I did so I let him have them. The broccoli was still crisp which is a plus for me because I hate soggy veggies. \n\nMy husband and I shared a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee ($8.00) which was yummy. I particularly like the top the best. \n\nThe prices were very reasonable especially because we also had the 20% off coupon. The food is definitely worth coming back for .

My personal favorite is the truffle parmesan french fries. It tastes the same as the truffle parmesan fries at Eat Chow in Newport Beach, but I think it has a stronger flavor than Eat Chow.

So glad we decided on Sushi Doraku! We ate a little early (about 4:45pm) and there was only two booths that had people in them. We decided to sit at the sushi bar. I had a spicy salmon handroll with cilantro and the sweet shrimp w/heads. My boyfriend had one of their signature rolls (can't remember which one) and everything was GREAT! My brother and his family live close to this restaurant so I let him know how much we enjoyed the food and service so they could also visit. Next time we are on that side of town it's certainly on the top of our list to eat at!,1.0,0.9990461468696594

And I must say, I was actually surprised that, overall, everything I tried was very tasty. My boyfriend and I were meeting my brother here while he was in town for the penguins game, and it was packed because of a concert at consol that night. We did a lap around the bar and came up empty so we put our name in (45 min wait) and grabbed a table at Uptown to get a few drinks first. Personally, I think Uptown has the better drafts than Blue Line and I was surprised to see there were so many on upstairs that were not on tap downstairs. We were seated at 7pm, which was exactly what we were hoping would happen since the game began at 7pm. Our server came over quickly and got our drinks. We started off with the Poutine which was pretty good. Not overly salty at all (like Station's street was when they were open) and just enough cheese. The gravy was on the side which I lied that touch so we could all put our own amount on. I wish the fries were a bit crispier but it was still good overall. My brother had the buffalo chicken wrap, my boyfriend had a burger, and I had the chorizo and wild mushroom quesadilla. They both liked their meals and mine was surprisingly one of the better quesadillas I've had in awhile. After our meals came service pretty much stopped though. My brother asked for more water twice and never got any. I ended up letting him drink my untouched glass and he also ended up drinking my boyfriend's water as well. The server did bring beer when we asked and a box but apparently could not be bothered with bringing more water. Mark Madden was actually at the table next to us and had a personal buffet set up for him. Besides his annoying commentary the entire game, everything else at Blue Line was positive enough to return in the future.",1.0,0.9749959707260132

Because of the event we got 25% off our liquor purchases. I had a glass of wine and then there were set appetizers for the event and I'm going to try not to judge my experience on these set appetizers because they were not very good.  However the space is super cool and that is saying a lot. When my brother came to visit he wanted barbecue and we happened to be in town Square so of course we are here.  Now the service was really bad. In fact we got up to leave after they brought us water because we just thought they were never coming back but they did see us get up to leave they did come over the manager came over and he gave us free dessert.

Because you might just think \""well, of course you like it here! You're a foodie, this place has great food, so, duh!\"" Well, yes, that's part of it. But there's more.\n\nSee, I AM a foodie. I love food. I love eating it, preparing it, and eating it when someone else has prepared it in exchange for money. But even though I am a foodie, my brother, alas, is not. My brother could not be pickier when it comes to food: burgers need to be plain, steaks need to be free of condiments, and the only acceptable beverage to consume is water. So you can imagine my dismay when it comes to my brother and I eating a meal together. He usually just wants lame food, and I want condiments galore. Enter Chipotle. \n\nThe great thing about Chipotle, and also Subway, is that you can watch these guys assemble your meal right in front of you! And since everything is \""custom made\"" at this place, you really only get what you want. My brother gets a plain steak burrito: steak, rice, beans, cheese. I get a steak burrito, too, but I have more stuff in it: steak, rice, beans, cheese, corn, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. This is really a place where we both get EXACTLY what we want, so we're both happy. \n\nPlus, it's a cool concept: pick how you wanna eat it (burrito, taco, bowl...), pick the protein (chicken, steak...) and then add the delicious plusses (lettuce, beans, rice...). \n\nI think one of the extra plusses of this place is that they have healthy options, too. If you opt for the chicken bowl with no cheese or guac or sour cream, it's pretty healthy. And, even better, it's still delicious! You can't beat that!",1.0,0.9975453019142152

We took a seat at the bar while we waited on a table to clear, and I ordered a glass of their specialty Dead Head Double Red Ale, which was a delicious brew that nicely balanced a strong presence of bitter hops with a pleasant malty sweetness.\n\nAfter being seated, we glanced at the menu and quickly decided for reasons of cost to forgo appetizers and to ignore the entree section entirely (Destihl is nothing if not pricey). I ordered for my main course the Flat Iron Quesadilla off the appetizer section, which was a quesadilla with flat iron steak, arugula dressed in a garlic vinaigrette, and a blend of bleu and cream cheese. (My brother ordered a veggie burger with hand-cut fries.) When the food arrived, I was a bit surprised to discover that my steak quesadilla was more like a deconstructed steak quesadilla, with the tortillas and cheese, the steak, and the arugula all occupying separate sections on my plate. Although each component was delicious (particularly the cheese mixture and the vinaigrette), it was a little difficult to eat, the tortillas were greasy, and the giant mound of arugula was just way too much. Also, for the price ($10.75) I was expecting the amount of food to be a little more substantial. My brother on the other hand said that his veggie burger was the best he'd ever had, and the few fries I stole off his plate were quite tasty.\n\nUnfortunately, dessert was a disappointment. I ordered the Stout Ice Cream Sandwich, which was a chocolate stout ice cream served between two brownies. I thought I was going to love it, but the brownies were way too thick, dense and gummy, and once the ice cream began to melt and ooze out the sides brownie was all I was left with to eat.\n\nSo all in all, my beer was great, my main course delicious but problematic in its assembly, and my dessert was disappointing. The service, however, was excellent. Despite the inconsistent food and high prices, I will definitely return to Destihl in order to sample some of the very intriguing items on the menu (including the Brewmaster's Pizza, the Beer Battered Bacon, and the Deviled Eggs).",0.0,0.8473151326179504
