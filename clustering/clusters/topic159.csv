I jumped through their hoops to get things corrected and even accepted that it would be over a week before someone could come to balance my refrigerator.

Customer service girl (Elsa) was rude & had no care that our fridge wasnt in & made no efforts to find out how long it will take.  We asked to talk to manager (Tom) who was basically acting the same...didn't know when our fridge would be in, it was back ordered (which no one thought to even tell us until we called) and answering our questions with \""I don't know\"" or \""ok...?\"" as if he was annoyed by our questions as to when we would get a refrigerator. when we decided to cancel our order, Tom just said \""ok, it's cancelled\"", no apologies, no trying to find a solution.

He showed me where the initial installation was done poorly, and how it was a rebuilt microwave, lacking correct parts and even serial numbers.  Everett ordered a few different parts for the microwave, which he replaced the following week.  He even offered a few helpful tips on cleaning our dishwasher, something to look for if our refrigerator starts acting up, and the best way to clean stainless steel.  What great service!\nYes, the 4-hour window is somewhat annoying, but probably an industry standard (there is worse).  And on both occasions, Everett showed up during the first hour.

Now mind you the commercial style stove had been ordered seven months prior. We had to wait a week. They finally delivered the stove, but forgot the grills on which one cooks. No one knows where they are. They bent the back of the stove by cinching it too tight to the dolly. I tell them just put it in I can not see the back. They say they can not install the hood and fan that day, will be back tomorrow morning. Never came back. It took two days to get an answer as to when they will bring the grates and install the hood. The grates came via UPS and the guy who came to install the hood said he does not know how to install on the granite wall. So we tell him to just forget that part and install the actual hood. He can't, why I never understood. Someone else came four days later and installed the hood and brought the fridge. The door on the fridge is scrapped up. They replace it with a new one a few weeks later and this one has a very crooked logo on the door and with a very week seal on the door. We saved very little money with this purchase.

This time for a alarm clock sounding buzz.\n\n    I was sold this unit for $600. plus a 6 year warranty for a total of $855.57. I don't think that is a cheap dishwasher. I bought it because the salesman, Tony L. advised me that it has a bigger motor and larger holes in the water distribution system resulting in less scraping and cleaner dishes. That made sense to us.\n\n    The first time I had a repair tech out it was because the dishes do not get clean. We were advised to buy the \""pellets\"" soap at Costco and to increase the water temperature. The next time a tech came out it was because the dishwasher would not drain. The technition opened the bottom of the dishwasher and cleaned it out. He advised us that the problem was that we bought a cheap dishwasher and that we should have sprung for the Bosch. He also advised uds to quit using thre \""pellet\"" soap as the dishwasher is not powerful enough to break it down so some grains stick to the dishes. We were also put on a cup of vinegar each month on a empty wash cycle to help the machine wash the soap from it's system.\n\n    Next the dishwasher started flooding my kitchen. This happened repeatedly. When the tech showed up I was advised that there was a problem with the drain valve and rather than replace it the tech removed the quiet guard and left it under my sink. When asked about it he said that if it flooded again to call them again and they would come out and try something else. He also advised me that a cheap dishwasher like this was loud anyway so I would not notice the sound difference.\n\n    A few days later I called the Scottsdale Spencers TV & Appliance and asked for the manager. I believe his name was Tony. He listened to my story and advised me that he would call me back the next day and that he would have the manager of Goldwing Appliance Factory Service call me.\n\n    That was about 60 days ago and I have yet t hear back from anyone.\n\n    My dishwasher is again in need of repair.\n\n    Each time the repair person from Goldwing Appliance (owned by Spencers) have said the problem was caused by buying a cheap dishwasher and that we should have bought the Bosh.\n\n    I can not tell you how disappointed I am in all three of these businesses. Spencers TV & Appliance in Scottsdale, Goldwing Appliance Factory Service and General Electric.\n\n    Make no mistake, I will buy Bosh next time but it will be from another retailer. I just wish I could have gotten more than 2 1/2 years out of this poorly constructed product and some real service out of a 6 year extended warranty.\n\n    Buyer Beware!",0.0,0.9994267225265504

I have experienced several minor issues with them that have become big issues because I can hardly get our salesperson Paul to return our calls. \n\nThe first issue was when our fridge was making a sound that you could hear throughout the ENTIRE house. I called in for mechanical support on a Saturday and they told me that I would have to wait until Monday for service. It was an issue that couldn't wait out the weekend. I asked them to escalate the issue to a GM or owner and they said they are not available on the weekends. This issue did not get solved by them.\n\nI then received a bill from a third party installation company for the installation of of our RO system. The problem is that we paid Spencers for the installation. Since that time I have had several calls with Spencers in an attempt to resolve the issue. \n\nA couple of weeks later I called to talk to Paul about a discount that had failed to be applied to our purchase. As soon as he heard that it was me he went into assuring me that the billing issue was resolved.\n\nLast week, guess what? I got a collections threat from the third party vendor that Spencers had supposedly resolved this billing issue with. I called in to Spencers on Wednesday night and left a message for Paul to call me. Fast forward to Saturday, guess what no call from Paul. I then called Spencers and now Paul is on vacation. I then asked to talk to the GM. \""I am sorry we don't have a GM on duty over the weekends. He will be in on Tuesday.\"" Ohhh, the GM must be out celebrating a long weekend. Maybe it is a little known retailers holiday like \""Double Billing Days?\"" How do you not have a Manager or Tech people on call at least over the weekends?\n\nI have utilized their website \""contact us\"" e-mail address and have still not heard back from anyone. \n\nLet's see did I miss anything?\nMisbilled\nDiscount not applied\nNo Tech/Mechanical support on Saturday afternoons or all day Sundays\nNo Managers on duty on the weekend\nSales Person not returning calls\n\nNo, I think that pretty much covers it.

Great she thought I'll get that do the washing done and cook a lovely dinner. Around comes 5pm she calls them back to find out they had forgotten to put the washer and dryer on the delivery truck. So no washing and no dinner as the wife wasn't able to go shopping whilst I was working.\n\nWe accepted the mistake and re-arranged the delivery for the following Saturday (due to work, and the fact we needed to wash our clothes). \n\nAlong comes Saturday we get a phone call at half past eight (fantastic we can get them installed do some washing and we have all weekend). When I greeted the truck I found out that they had managed to smash the dryer up so it would need to be changed, but the washer was ok (although neither washer or dryer were in boxes to suggest they were new and now off the shop floor). After we got the washer installed we ran the test cycle which worked fine so we did medium load cycle for a total of five minuets before the drum fell off the rail and broke.\n\nSo now we have a week late washer installed that was broken, a dryer that was poorly handled in the truck so had to go back and now we had to wait in till the delivery truck could come and take the broken washer!!!\n\nWhen the truck did turn up the delivery guys were apologetic and promised a potential delivery later that day (Saturday) or first thing Sunday.\n\nSunday comes along, we wait till 0900 before calling them to find out what was going on. \""I'm sorry sir but the delivery team have gone and we don't have that model in store anymore\"".\nFirst point why the hell did we have to call to get this update!\nSecondly why the hell haven't Lowes got off the arses to help the customer!\n\nOutcome unknown, my advise to anyone who is using Lowes is to go to Home Depot or buy it and take it themselves from the store as the customer service will NOT help you.

The fridge was too tall for the space, and instead of trying to find another fridge, they left it and said they were going to send out a carpenter to cut the cabinet to fit the fridge. This was not authorized by the landlord, but rather just the property manager. The fridge was left out in the walkway between our counter and island, where it still remains. They were not authorized to cut the cupboard and it was requested that the original fridge be returned. They have told the property manager that it cannot be done before Friday.

After about 5 months, I got sick of buying ice from the grocery store and called both our home warranty and KitchenAid (the make of the fridge) to get some recommendations for refrigerator repair. Between those two companies, I was given 4 names for repair places.\n\nI spent about an hour searching and reviewing all four companies on Google. 3 of those companies had a host of terrible reviews, and 2 of them had an F rating from the BB. Only 1 of the companies had mediocre reviews, and an A from the BBB.\n\nDuring my research however, I stumbled upon \""The Refrigerator Specialist.\"" I was a little skeptical at first, due to the same name and number popping up on multiple websites, without much other information. Despite this, there seemed to be a host of glowing comments.\n\nSo, since the first 4 people recommended to me all looked pretty terrible, I took a chance and called this place. Mike (the owner?) answered the phone. I get the feeling this is just one guy running his own refrigerator repair business.\n\nMike comes across a little gruff (think East Coast type of attitude) but got straight to the point. I called late on a Friday afternoon and he was here early Saturday morning. \nHe took a look at my fridge, told me exactly what was wrong with it and what it would cost to fix. He didn't play games. He didn't try to up sell me. He didn't add on any crazy fees. His prices were very reasonable. \n\nOnce we agreed on the price, he fixed it then and there (he had extra parts in his truck). It was honestly quite refreshing to deal with someone who is prompt, honest, and does quality work. The next time I have any problem with my refrigerator or freezer, Mike will be the first person I call.",0.0,0.98982834815979

Well my washing machine is under warranty through Home Depot ... NEVER AGAIN will I get an appliance from them, but that is another story.

Buy-Rite came out and looked at my machine for a whole 5 minutes and diagnosed it.  Waited a full week without a working machine before the repair company came back with a part, fixed it and tried to leave before testing the machine.  I had them run a cycle and wouldn't you know the machine did the same thing I initially called about.  \n\nI was told they'd have to go through the warranty for approval of the part (this was 3-19-14).  It's now the 28th and there has been no updates until I called them.  I was told they're still waiting for approval for the part.  I call my warranty and they confirm - still waiting on approval.  The kicker is, I was told the approval should only take two business days.  \n\nThe story gets better!!  \n\nOnce approval is made .. it will take 18-21 days to get the part.

It was definitely the right decision.  In Nov 2013, my dishwasher began to leak water.  We noticed the screws on the door were working their way loose and would not remain tight.  Over time they fell out completely.  A call for service before Christmas resulted in an appointment on Jan. 7.  After fully describing the problem, the repairman arrived without the parts to do the repair job.  Complaining did no good. He ordered the parts and rescheduled the repair for Jan 27.  New repairman came yesterday and guess what???  Still didn't have the correct parts to finish the job.  We've waited over a month and a half and do not have a fixed appliance. Thank goodness I could still run the machine to clean my dishes as long as I stuffed newspaper under it on the floor to catch the leaking water.\n\nNever again will we buy a Sears or Sears-supported appliance!!",0.0,0.9996052384376526

Leonard came out and was immediately able to fix my issue and gave me a few options if I wanted to invest on what the repair would cost.

D called and asked a lot of questions I took for granted. What he was doing was diagnosing the problem as best he could so he had the best preparation of parts. D went the extra step when he saw that the replacement fan was not very good quality, he went and got another one.\n\nWe were completely satisfied wit D and Del Tech Services. D was referred by a friend so we thought he would be good. He was very thorough. He arrived when he said he would and worked very cleanly.\n\nD gave some excellent advice when restarting our fridge if we move or disconnect it. He  was very respectful and professional.\n\nThanks a lot. We would strongly recommend Del Tech Services. Thanks for your service to our country too.",1.0,0.9746736884117126
