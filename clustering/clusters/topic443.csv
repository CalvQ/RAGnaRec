This store in particular (at Chandler Fashion Center) is HUGE. Beyond enormous. It's so big, it has its own entrance/exit leading outside the mall. It's like four or five of the smaller clothing stores you'll find inside the mall put together. \n\nThis wouldn't be such a bad thing if this store had ANY form of organization, but it doesn't. Everything is set up in a completely random, nonsensical order, which makes trying to find anything specific a dizzying and frustrating experience. There are various \""rooms\"" throughout the store that all have their own set of shirts, dresses, pants, bottoms, purses, etc. The only items that are grouped together are jewelry and handbags, but even those can be found littered throughout the store. The store associates don't even know where to locate something, so don't bother asking unless you're feeling brave.\n\nTo further prove my point, I went into the store to exchange an item I had bought online that was too large. I was pointed to one room, where the cashier guessed the item might be. When I asked the salesperson if there were any other colors available for this item, she told me to go check another room... on the opposite side of the store. WTF?! Why are two items of the same style in different rooms? I think they just like to mess with their customers' heads.\n\nSo shopping here is nearly impossible and kind of exhausting. You basically have to browse the entire store to find things you like that might fit you. Everything runs small, like they're meant for small-framed girls. This is also why you will see plenty of 8-year-olds running around with gaudy fashion jewelry and handbags, swiping their parents' credit cards as they ring up the latest of F21's thousands of items.\n\nThat's another problem here - the store's inventory is changing CONSTANTLY. Sure, there's a great selection, but if you buy something that doesn't fit and come back a few weeks later, you might not be able to exchange it anymore because it's no longer there.\n\nOn the plus side, the clothes are cute (albeit cheaply made) and extremely affordable. But going into the store to shop isn't worth the experience. I've decided to stick to online shopping when it comes to this one. You will save yourself hours of frustration by doing the same.",0.0,0.999351441860199

I felt almost like I was in a middle-eastern souk, with merchants tugging at my sleeves. That part was very unpleasant, and is reason enough for me to stay away from here in the future.\n\nIn particular, there was a shop selling cosmetics for prices that were beyond ridiculous - literally hundreds of dollars for a jar of goop.

I on the other hand will not touch anything (because I have spent a lot of money as it is on taxi rides) and only want to buy a few things, so I clutched my bag to my chest and waited for people to walk out of the narrow aisles; just in the off chance me and someone bump into each other one of us would be held responsible. \nAs I was turning into a narrow isle, the plastic half mannequin was sticking out on the edge of a shelf (carefully trying to walk by it) knocked it over onto the floor as well two plastic tin containers.
