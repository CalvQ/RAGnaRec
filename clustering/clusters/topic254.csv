I experienced Scotts first time through Living Social, $5 for $10 worth before 11 am only.  I had \""hot\"" pastrami, but the pastrami was not hot at all, not even warm.   Just room temp, but very lean, even tho I did not order extra lean.  It was terribly salty, and not much peppercorn taste.  I felt the price was quite expensive $10.95 for what you get, and the sandwich was not that big.  The rye bread very soft, the kind that compresses to dough on our meat, when you hold it..  Bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread.  The cole slaw was the tiniest serving I'd ever been served in my life.   Wimpy and translucent cabbage, just one tablespoon in one of those tiny \""dipping sauce\"" plastic cups for sauce to go, barely wide enough to stick your fork into that tiny cup.  The only thing I really liked, was the  pickles.  \nThe waitress overcharged me for my sandwich, $12.50 instead of $10.95 it said on the menu.  When I drew that to her attention, she said she was thinking of something else, and apologized.  I'd rather buy pastrami from a deli, a loaf of rye bread, and make my own, even for the $8 I paid with tax and tip ($5 Living Social plus tax and tip).

Did Brian sell it or what. Just ate there again and had small fries, med drink, and a regular pastrami burger. Cost me $16.00. They brought out our fries way before our burger and then the burger was just a frozen hamburger with pastrami on it. They say it's a half lb of pastrami but it wasn't. So disappointing.
