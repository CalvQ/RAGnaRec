In addition to the great chiropractic care I was given, they also have massage and rehab for particular cases. \n\nThey also have the top of the line spinal decompression machine called the DRX 9000 which is awesome. This is unique and not everyone has this machine because of its cost. The worked great for my low back pain and was what I needed.\n\nThanks so much for the great care you provided and I will recommend you guys to anyone in the area.",1.0,0.9987241625785828

She is treating my sciatica and has been effectively treating it and preventing it from getting worse. She knows what she is doing and she does it well.

All of the staff here are so friendly and always smiling. \n\nI have also done the massage packages along with my boyfriend and we love their work.

They are that good. My therapist is Larry and he is terrific. From the first day that we reviewed my injury and my symptoms, through the present he has been able to relieve my back pain/neck pain through our meetings. After every session I feel like I am ultra relaxed, with my back barely aching. He starts the session with a review of your current aches, pains, and worries which I can tell he listens to astutely; for he works out all of those pain/ache points and after words makes sure you are feeling more loose and much better. \n\nIn addition to the injuries I stated above I am prone to anxiety and stress; Larry has given me tips to relieve these symptoms as well as works on pressure points on my head, chest, and hands that have helped me regulate these feelings of fear and tension.\n\n I mention Larry this much because I believe in him as a person and a massage therapist. In addition to Larry I want to mention Lois; she is the partial owner of Harbor Lake Massage and her heart is evident in the business. She is always super nice when I walk in, asking about my life and other discussion points. I gave Harbor Lake Massage a 5 out of 5 because in my opinion they are the cream of the crop.
