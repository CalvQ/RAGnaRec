The equipment would often break down and never get fixed. Considering how small the gym is, it's inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month. I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely broken.\n\nThe gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings, but it would be pretty packed after work. It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.\n\nI was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month). Though they're technically right (it IS in the contract), I feel that their staff mislead me.\n\nIf you live in Shadyside (or nearby)... GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD. It's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside... although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now, I am 100% done with that place.",0.0,0.9966341853141784

That alone was a debacle, which I will detail below. The issues that I noted above continued. Worn out equipment. Machines broken for too long. Having to do laps around the gym looking for olympic bar collars. So, I went to cancel.\n\n1. Tried to cancel by calling them. Told that I have to either go to the gym or mail a certified letter to cancel. Uh, seriously? 2. Charged a brand new annual membership fee. Yes, on the day that I cancelled. They decided that it was more important to pocket an extra $19 than honor the fact that I was canceling. They refused to refund the charge. So, I'll have to push the bank to reverse the charge or go to court. Yippee. 3. Initially declined to refund the last month's dues that I paid when I signed up. Once I pointed out in the contract that it was refundable, they agreed that it was refundable if I requested a refund. What was I doing if not requesting a refund?\n\nSo, my guess is that, based on the state of the equipment and the fact that they're trying to squeeze every cent out of their customers, they must be in financial trouble. Why else treat people this way? \n\nMy advice is to stay away. I've joined another gym where they want you to be happy and try to do what they can to keep you there rather than squeeze everything out of you when you try to leave.",0.0,0.9997965693473816

I've worked with other trainers in the past very successfully and these training sessions were by far the worst bang for the buck.  The sessions are short and expensive compared to other packages I've had in the past.  The trainers vary significantly in knowledge - to the point that one trainer I worked with aggravated old injuries I suffered from and I had to ask to be reassigned.  My next trainer was knowledgable, but not available frequently enough, due to scheduling limitations.  I ended up losing money due to scheduling more often than not.  \n\n(3)  The membership and training contracts are extraordinarily difficult to leave.

About a month ago my husband found this ymca relatively close by and as a former military family they gave us a preferred membership fee without a sign up fee.\n\nSo far I'm really happy with this place. The work out area is spacious and the equipment are modern and clean. There is an outdoor pool and classes I haven't used yet, but so far I'm very satisfied with everything and enjoy my workouts a lot.",1.0,0.9997201561927797
