It is filled with lies, as it would be.  I have nothing to gain by making false statements.  He has $$$$$  to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice.  I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG.  If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too.  I took her to a chiropractic  vet in AZ the next day.  After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument.  NO BLOOD.  \nPlus, Bishop  did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way.  NOTHING.  NADA.   He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.

(See my prior review). I went to another clinic I was denied care no reason was given.  My girlfriend informed me today that she was denied care at two other clinics that day  after they reviewed the records from the Peoria clinic. She was the one making phone calls to try to get my dog care.  Something in the chart that was faxed over to the other surgical pet centers made those surgeons not want to see me. I went to a fifth clinic without notifying them who I was. They did agree to see me but told me that after calling around they were informed I had left the prior night without paying. I paid for my full care at this new clinic immediately with a credit card  and then after the treatment was completed I was actually refunded money. I will write a review of this amazing center later. My dog did not have significant abdominal bleeding. This was determined by a CT the appropriate test in this case. The Peoria clinic probably does not have a CT scanned so they do X-rays and ultrasounds which are not as good at diagnosing the pet and together  more expensive. Today I realize If my dog had abdominal bleeding she would have died because we were refused care at multiple emergency pet hospitals as a result of us refusing to be treated in this Peoria clinic. When I first came into the Peoria clinic and what I was most concerned with was the paw which I thought might be broken. The  Peoria vet missed the diagnosis of brachial plexus avulsion/injury and did not even mention any leg injury but tried to make the diagnosis of intra-abdominal  bleeding that needed surgery. (5000$ bill). She did not address possible bladder rupture or pelvic fracture in a dog that is prone to hip dysplasia. This is negligent. Where is the justification of opening up a dogs abdomen if she will never walk again or if you can't repair a severely lacerated bladder? I am a surgeon I have seen abdomens in human beings that needed immediate surgery. I was not believing this awful vets diagnosis and attempts to extort money from me. I stood my ground maybe not in the best way possible but I was stressed and on the brink of breaking down. Below is the picture of the receipt of payment that I was given in the Peoria clinic. Why did they then tell other clinics that we did not pay? Why did they prevent me from seeking care for my dog? The attitude seems to be comply with out treatment plan, have us make lots of money or we will prevent you and your pet from getting care anywhere else. Stay away from this scam. It's been days.
