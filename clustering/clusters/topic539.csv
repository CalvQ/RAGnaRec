Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThat said, I never enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \""fast food\"" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me.",0.0,0.9962775111198424

Have heard so much about Sam's Cafe and now wonder why.  Upon entering, the first (and lasting) impression was that it was dirty.  Okay, in my Harley riding days, I've eaten at many greasy spoons that turned out dynamite food.  Not the case here.  Service was perfunctory but that could be owing to the place being so busy.  Coffee was decent.  Ordered the Western Omelet.  Huge.  To their credit, it was filled with slices of bacon instead of just pieces, slices of ham instead of diced pieces, and large pieces of sausage patties.  That having been said, the vegetables were soggy and the entire omelet lacked seasoning of any kind.  Totally bland.  The American Fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor.  Had to have at least a half order of their much ballyhooed French Toast after reading the rave reviews here.  Blah!!  Did these reviewers eat the same stuff as I did?  There was nothing remotely commendable about it.  It was soggy and relatively flavorless.  I tried it with and without syrup.  The syrup at least gave it flavor, albeit that of low grade imitation maple syrup.  It's been a while since I left that much food on my plate.  This may be a case of the Emperor's New Clothes as it is with so many of the \""In\"" places in C-U.  \""Oh look, we found this quaint little cafe downtown; you must try it.\""  Of course, if you disagree you are obviously declasse.

I've found the holy grail of satisfying lunches!\n\nBefore I get into why 808 is going to be the death of my latest pair of jeans, I will say the service is slow. This is a really family operation and they make everything to order. So when you finally make it over here, be patient and keep in mind that your food isn't being slopped around by some apathetic teenager making minimum wage.

Crispy, savory goodness with this sauce that just.doesn't.stop! You can order the sauce mild or spicy but because I don't like to go back to work with deeply resonating heartburn, I always get mild. The fringe benefit of the sauce is it coats the rice underneath the chicken which kind of makes the rice like...second lunch!\n\nI could write a novel on their macaroni salad, but since you are seconds from wandering away from this post, possibly in the direction of 808, I will say this: this is the macaroni salad to end all macaroni salads. Why? Because this mac salad has potato in it! Sure, other places might do it like this, but no one has the balanced tastiness that 808 has on theirs.\n\nThey have all kinds of home down Hawaiian specialties that will fill up your stomach and make your heart happy. Portions aren't for wimps, but all of the food is served in the styrofoam to go containers which make for easy transport if you can't shovel through your food like the rest of us. \n\nI won't be offended if you got up from your computer midway through this review to go to 808.

I go up to the counter again, the same gentleman asks what I need, tells her yet again and they actually start a mini argument right in front of me about how busy she is and can't grab the drinks! The drive thru may have been busy but it was dead inside with only one other customer, who also did not get their drinks after they ordered. That's got to be fixed, it doesn't take but 30 seconds for her to grab a cup and ice.\n\nThe restaurant was also pretty dirty, all the tables were visibly greasy and had either salt or some sort of trash on them.
