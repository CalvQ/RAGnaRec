The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates, 3 pairs and no luck.  The first pair had laces that were cobbled together from 2 different skates.  The blades were dull and rounded over like an old butter knife.  The second pair was better, but the left blade was bent to the right at a 10 degree angle making it impossible to skate.  The last pair was a bit better, but wholly unusable.  This wasn't just my experience, this was the experience of all 7 of us in the group.  All the skates had been abused and hadn't seen a sharpener or any maintenance in quite some time.  \n\nWe decided to stick with Extreme Ice in Indian Trail.  It is a bit of a drive, but a professional operation start to finish.  New skates, longer skate times and a pro shop that caters to other skaters, not just hockey.",0.0,0.9984886646270752

The ice makes all the difference in my opinion.\n\nWhile the skate sharpening may be better than the \""other\"" Charlotte rink (which is incredibly important if you're renting skates), but I'd have to recommend bringing your own skates in the first place. Yes, I know most people won't have their own...but rental skates in general are like wearing someone else's shoe...and skates...unlike shoes...are hard and not very pliable. So prepare for sore feet if you rent.\n\nI found the employees to be very helpful and knowledgeable. I had fun chatting with them and found a couple from my neck-of-the-woods.\n\nThe only thing I would have liked to see different is the spaciousness of the place. I know there's not much that can be done about this, but on comparison (yes, from Minnesota...as everyone grows up playing hockey there), the Ice House is a bit cramped.\n\nOverall, I liked the Ice House...so don't let the three stars fool you. The atmosphere is nice...the smell...oh how I love the smell...lol...as some of you may say ewwww...what's that smell. There's nothing like the smell of hockey!\n\nI recommend the Ice House.

The Pineville Ice House, as it is better known, is great fun with the kids, a group, family, for a birthday party and most other stuff you think of doing at your standard roller-rink except the kicker is that it's on ice!\n\nI've made it here a number of times including once with a big group for a [dangerous] game called broom ball. In broom ball, the players clad only in their everyday clothes and without ice skates, go out on the ice with a broom-like stick to swat at a ball until makes it into the other team's goal. All the while you spend most of your time trying not to throw yourself off balance with a misplaced swing and land yourself in the hospital with a concussion. But hey! This review isn't meant to trash ice skating. Only the futile and foolish game of broom ball.\n\nNonetheless, PIH is a good starting point for you up-and-coming figure skaters out there. The main advice I have is to just check their website as they have some oddly specific hours during which they are open to the public for skating.

The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. \n\nThe negatives... I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette... There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! \n\nThe positives... They serve beer and wine!!

I skated backwards, I did twirls and even executed a highly skilled jump, and I have not even been on a pair of skates for sixteen years.\n\nThe pro shop did not have gloves, but quickly after getting on the ice I realized that I wouldn't need them because I was going to spend my time upright versus laying on the ice like I had anticipating before realizing how highly skilled of a skater I am. \n\n$8.25 (I think) paid my admission for two hours of skating and got me some sweet rental skates. I really wanted some graceful white ones, but I got brown. Fortunately I had leg warmers to complete my ensemble and tie everything together. Brown has never looked so good with sparkly gray tights before. \n\nThere were plenty of places to pop a squat to put on your skates or take a break and they have lockers to stash your shoes and hand bags. It also appears they have a snack bar and vending machines, but I did not partake in any of those offerings. \n\nI did, however, partake in some libations at the Ice House, located at the east end of the rink.

I'm certain they were too intimidated by my amazing skating skills to join on the ice.\n\nIf you thought THAT was impressive, just you wait...

Scottsdale.  A friend said we should try this place because it is a lot less crowded, which sounded nice because the open skate at the ice den can be chaotic and too crowded.  I should also say that I really wanted to like this place.  When we got there, it was not very clear where we pay for open skate and rent the skates.  We finally figured out that you have to go into the shop, so we went in and there was only one worker who was helping someone pick out skates, we had to wait a long time before she could ring us up to skate.  Then she didn't tell us where to go to get our skates, I had to ask her.  She pointed where to go, then she said she would be right there.  Is this a one-man operation??  So, again, we had to wait for her to come around.  The ice skates were in horrible condition, in my opinion, they seemed 30 years old!! We also rented some trainers for the kids.  (I couldn't believe we had to pay $5 each for them, they were made out of pvc pipe!!)\nThe ice was incredibly choppy and was hard to skate on and the place was just kind of yucky.  The only good thing I can say about it is that there weren't a lot of people, but I can see why!  I really don't think it's any cheaper than the ice den, in fact, their trainers definitely cost more and are way less sturdy.

Crap!  I think I may have done better skating had I been a bit tipsy.  Oh well, next time!\n\nI had a groupon that was about to expire so we went on a Saturday during open skate.  There were 2 birthday parties going on at the same time so it was pretty packed.  \n\nI noticed that to pay for the skate assist walkers, you had to go inside the shop, pay, and then go out to the skate rental to get the walkers.  We had to wait 20 minutes to rent them because when we went to pay, there wasn't any available and the guy working the counter wouldn't take our $ until some were turned in.  The problem was, everytime one was turned in an adult would hurry to the rental counter saying they had paid, and they were just handing them out without double checking.  I finally had to convince the kid at the counter to just let me pay for it and I would stand at the rental counter and wait.  If it wasn't for my morals as well as setting a good example for my kids, I would have done the same thing as everyone else.  Paying $5ea for 3 kids to have walkers, when everyone else was getting them for free kind of sucked! \n\nMy kids loved this place.  They had a lot of fun, and it was a cool break.

In fact, it was pretty warm, and no gloves are needed as long as you don't fall down.\n\nI agree, with other reviews that the ice isn't as smooth as it should be, the building is old and the facilities are shabby.  The outskirts of the rink are dirty and cluttered.

As I have mentioned in my SoBe Arena review, the quality of the ice is indeed better over there. However, the Las Vegas Ice center does bolster two separate ice rinks. The only problem with this is their South Rink is god awful compared to their North Rink, speaking from a hockey standpoint. The ice has divots in it even after the zamboni has gone over it, the boards have a nasty habit of kicking the puck out to center ice if the puck is being wrapped around, the boards also move outwards in certain areas in which the puck could get stuck along with players skates and sticks. I believe some of the problems are due to the fact that the South Rink was built upon sand whereas the North Rink was built on concrete.\n\nMy ice analysis aside, the LVIC is a great place to play hockey, figure skate, catch a public skate, or go curling! The hockey leagues are run quite well here and are a lot of fun to be involved in. The staff is very professional and offers great customer service.

I think having the skate shop, birthday party area, lockers, skate rental, and concession stand all in the same small area is was a bad idea. The price is right for a cheap way to escape the heat but constant flow of people young and old wobbling around on skates is not my most favorite idea of fun. \nPlus, the \""rink guards\"" the employees who are supposed to keep the patrons safe and make sure they are following the rules... were too busy talking to each other to notice people speed skating, digging into the ice intentionally, the poor kids who were stranded in the middle of the rink, the skaters going in the opposite direction, the maniacs with the walkers bumping into the innocent skaters- makes for a very unsafe time.

I love skating. Isn't it like the thing you (have to) do with your family and friends during this time of year? I went to elementary school in Toronto, Canada so I am used to the whole skating thing. There are rinks pretty much everywhere, and everybody's there. And not many people besides kids not know how to skate. I also played ice hockey, but I hadn't been skating for a long time. The last time I skated was almost three years ago, and before that was probably three years before that. So, I got very excited.\n\nThe tickets were on Groupon so I had already bought my tickets. The NASCAR Hall of Fame was a great backdrop for the ice rink. Parking was easy with plenty of space. As I approached the outdoor ice rink, I noticed one thing - that there was only one line. Single file. A long, single file. I still assumed people with already purchased tickets can get access a bit quicker than those who didn't bother to get them. No dice. You will have to wait in line for about or over one half hour to get to the admissions desk. The skate rental is in the same booth as the ticketing desk so no luck going straight to get your skates either.\n\nAfter probably a good 35 to 40 minutes of just standing in the cold, our turn came to get our skates and jump right in! Or so we thought... For this and that reasons, we had to stand in another line and finally got onto the ice rink. Yes!\n\nNow, it gets a little brighter after this point. It was a lot of fun! It took me a bit to warm up and get loose but I still had some of the old moves. But most importantly skating with my wife by my side and laughing at people falling down around us was a lot of fun. Just kidding. (But some are really funny.) Naturally, you might wonder if it's safe if everybody's just sliding around here and there. Yes, they have a small circle in the middle with cones around it to stop and rest, and there is a lifeguard (?), or whatever you want to call it, all the time. Lastly, it is a very small ice rink so I don't think there's that much room for anyone to go crazy and cause serious injury. I saw a couple of people who obviously had played hockey before skate around and show off. But they also seem to understand that the majority are there to have fun whether they're good or not. So after a few circles they stop doing stunts too.\n\nHey, I almost forgot. Getting in is $10. skate rental is $3, and hot chocolate is $4!",0.0,0.9402315020561218

But it's the desert, not Central Park! We had temps reaching into the 70's a handful of the days, so it was the only way to make a lasting and skateable outdoor rink. I went skating here twice, once during the day and once at night. Both were fun, the daytime session allowed the rare chance to skate in a t-shirt. The nighttime session really excelled thou with the light show that accompanies each skate session! The ice took a few minutes to get used to, but once you got the hang of it, it was smooth sailing. One of the many skills in my book is the ability to ice skate, so it was definitely a fun time!\n\nThe characters that were on show around the area were really cool too!

However, I did take my 3 kids there on hopes of a super fun family night to celebrate my birthday. We knew we were in for disappointment when we drove up. First if all this place is in a tiny corner space of a strip mall. We decided to still give it a chance and go in. We took a little tour of the mini golf, laser tag, and \""party area\"". This place is a joke. It looks like something my friends and I could put together over a weekend with supply's from Home Depot. Seriously. The \""party area\"" had like two metal tables with a few metal chairs. I honestly thought it was a hidden camera joke. The putt putt 3D golf was laughable as well. Their website says they have pizza and food. We were hoping to eat first but they didn't have pizza. Just a \""menu\"" with soda and chips listed on it. What!? Needless to say this was a major waste if a drive. Now we know better. Although I would think this place will be out of business by the end of the month.",0.0,0.9991426467895508

My amazement was not hearing about it and it seems that although people may know about it, no one seems to have visited (no Yelp activity). That was peculiar. \n\nIt's located in the Roman Plaza between Serendipity 3 and The Absinthe tent. The best access would be to use their main valet, since it's very close. If you use self parking, just walk through the casino toward the main registration/front desk.\n\nAnyway, it's obvious why it isn't popular. First, they charge admission of $11 ($10 for Total Rewards members). Compared to The Cosmopolitan's no entrance fee for their popular Ice Rink at Boulevard Pool, not so good. Plus, it's for just 30 minutes and skates are an additional $5 to rent (to put it in perspective, it's $15 for an all-day skate rental at The Cosmopolitan or $10 for locals). Second, the rink is much smaller; although I do not skate, space is more desirable in many situations. Third, there are no fire pits to roast marshmallows!! Fourth, although almost literally on the Strip, you can't see much of it from the rink or seating area. Your view is just Caesars Palace.\n\nNow, if you are an inexperienced skater, they actually have trained skaters on site to assist! That could be an incentive for people that are looking to actually skate, but aren't very good at it. Not sure what could be accomplished in 30 minutes, but since they're not busy, you will most likely get one-on-one time.",0.0,0.9977567791938782

Our neighbor had a couple of extra tickets to an on ice performance of Frozen put on in the god awful dump now known as AZ Ice.  We arrived early and were mortified to see that the show was oversold and there were no more seats.  The person who planned this must have been hit in the head with a puck in the past and has to have someone else lace up her skates.  Instead of telling our neighbor's kid that she wouldn't get to see Frozen on her birthday we sat on the cold metal floor near the glass.  Mercifully, they had an intermission before my hip, knees and back gave out from sitting cross legged for forty minutes. We got up and stretched and went into the foul smelling, poorly run bathrooms.\nWhen we returned our spot was taken by some kids so we moved down to an open area.  Just before the show started again some fart faced woman approached us and started spazzing out over her kid's seats being stolen.  I told her we would love to sit somewhere else but had nowhere to go.  She couldn't believe that sitting on the ground were people's urine covered shoes had been wasn't our first choice.  Before I could finish explaining to her that she was a moron her husband, who was clearly been experiencing steroid induced performance issues, couldn't Let It Go and yelled at my wife and I. I got up and he nearly started a fist fight.  Finally, one of the frazzled employees asked for permission to use the facilities shared brain and the family was told to sit down and shut up.\nWe thought it was all over when a blotchy faced cave woman approached us and asked if we had a problem.  Still shocked from earlier we didn't know how to respond.  She said if we cause any more problems we will be kicked out.  Having the fear of being kicked out of a low budget, unlicensed, community theater production of Frozen sending shivers down our spines we sat silently for the rest of the show.  \nBottom line:  If you dropped out of high school, have a severe brain injury, don't read so good or consider yourself to be walking diarrhea you should open a skating rink.
