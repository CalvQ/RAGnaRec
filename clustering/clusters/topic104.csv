I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.

The lead group had three open holes in front of them. Two groups behind us quit and we still had 3 groups waiting to tee off on 18.

The current owners have done little to rectify the situation and have demonstrated no inclination to do so. They have taken bad management to a new level.

I like the course so much that I purchased the OB card from the Raven in the fall which offers a substantial discount for play.  My issue is as follows:  Last Saturday, I attempted to book a round for the coming Thursday.  I was informed by a young lady (Courtney?) that as a Raven card holder that I could only book four days in advance.  I got up at 7:00 AM the next morning and called for a tee time on Thursday.   I was asked if I was an OB card holder by Ben.  When I confirmed this, Ben advised me that there were no tee times until after 2:45 PM  on the Thursday.  I explained that I had tried to book the day before and was advised I need to wait until this morning to get a tee time and how could all of their tee times be taken.  Ben advised that members could book seven days in advance hence there were no tee times available.  I mentioned to Ben that it would appear that as an OB (Raven) cardholder that I was being penalized.  Ben advised no as I was getting cheap golf.  I replied that I was being penalized as if you can't get a tee time then you can't get the discounted golf.  Ben acknowledged that there was some truth to this.  I advised that I would be speaking to the course general manager Derek about is.\nLater that same morning I had a friend call the course for a tee time on the Thursday.  He was asked if he had an OB card and he did not.  At that point he was offered several tee times by Courtney.  I then called back at about 8:45 AM and spoke with Courtney.  She did not ask me if I had the discount card.  I asked for tee times on the Thursday morning and was offered several.  I subsequently booked one for Thursday morning.\nI certainly feel that the Raven staff and management is not being honest and forthright with OB cardholders and does not afford them the same courtesy that they provide to full fare golfers.  I will attempt to speak with the general manager today in an attempt to rectify these  disreputable practices.  Should this not work, I will contact the OB Sports Card management about same.\n\nDon't get me wrong; this is one of my favorite courses to play but my play and others will cease if this issue is not addrwssed",0.0,0.9223579168319702

SW reviewed Superstiton Mountain Country Club not Superstition Springs Golf Course.  The reason why I know this...I worked at Super Mountain CC while I was at ASU and I live about 1 mile from Supersition Springs.  So,  Superstition Springs is not Superstition Mountain....and the picture is of Hole #18 of the Prospector course of Supersition Mountain.\n\nOkay....Superstition Springs is a fair golf course.  The course is kind of hokey, as it has some really short holes...or really long holes with strange dog legs.  The course I think begins on hole #8 or #9 because the first 7 holes are just not well designed.  The back nine is better but #14 is a poorly designed hole.  The course condition is usually good but sometmes I've been out there and have seen the effects of heavy traffic.  I think the $115 per round rate is a little excessive for peak season because frankly 8 holes are crap....it's $120 per round for Wekopa and Wekopa is so much better + all 18 holes at Wekopa are AMAZING!!  I don't recommend this course because I think there are other courses that are better for $100-$130 price point.

When I play Dinosaur Mountain later this summer, the rating is subject to change.\n\nThe Sidewinder golf course itself is probably worthy of four stars.  The course was interesting enough, but there were a few quirks about the place that drops its rating a bit.\n\nFirst, the practice facility was a bit odd.  Next to the clubhouse is a driving range with mats, with no drivers allowed, and the putting green has targets, and not holes.  By the looks of the aerial view a la Google Maps, however, there might be a *real* practice area on the opposite side of the driving range.  If so, they should probably have advertised it.\n\nSecond, the greens were a bit slow and bumpy.  It looks like they were plugged only a couple weeks before we played.  An aerification warning would have been nice.  Besides that, the course was in great shape.\n\nFinally, and this is my biggest complaint, there was NO WATER ON THE COURSE.  In ARIZONA.  During SUMMER.  I consider this utterly absurd, and almost dropped it to two stars for this unfortunate fact alone.  I have played some pretty crappy golf courses, but this might be the only one I've played without water on the course.  Even municipals usually have gross water fountains.

A combination of factors may be to blame for this, including an unsucessful overseeding, the recent cold weather and rain, and the general quality of the maintenance. As other reviewers have noted, it's a pretty straight-forward, boring track with nary an elevation change.  It's not a hard course but the course does have a good design with bunkers guarding nearly every green.  The greens sloped from the back to front and can be quite tricky.

You do get a feeling that you're golfing in the middle of a desert, but I don't feel that the course was anything special as far as being picturesque.  The only time I felt like taking a picture was on the third hole, which had the Monument rock in the middle of the fairway.  I did like the sand in the bunkers.  It was actually sand, as opposed to rock (admittedly I wish I didn't have to discover that; fortunately I only experienced two of them).\n\nThe greens were horrible.  I have no doubt I could find a smoother putting surface on a Chicago city street during pothole season.  I've never seen so many bumps and jostles between the ball and the hole.  My playing partner was affected more because he was generally left with longer putts than me, but on at least 6 holes I watched him miss a putt because the ball bounced within 6 feet of the cup and subsequently fell off line.  On three others where he had long putts, I know his ball stopped shorter than he was planning on because of those bumps.  The wind affected my shots enough that I often had to chip and putt, but the bounciness of the greens cost me strokes with the putter as well.  I'm glad I had to chip and putt, because given the condition of the greens, that probably saved me from multiple 3-putt holes.\n\nI feel that the only reason the price is justified is so they can run the animation for the course flyovers on their website.

I asked why mine was more and he said it was because i made reservations too far in advance?  Their backwards approach is that if you make reservations 8 days or more out, non-locals pay less and locals pay more... if its 7 days and in, locals pay less and non-locals pay more. and it is a difference of $70 for locals! ($90 vs $160)  So i asked him how this works, and he said, with a straight face... \""what you have to do is make a reservation for 2 for non-locals in advance, then wait a couple days and add the 2 locals later.\""  I looked at him and said \""do you realize what you just said there?\""  he said, \""yep that's how we do it.\""  I don't see how you can say this to someone without laughing and saying, \""yeah, it doesn't make sense but we got ya bitch!\"" So the 2 locals had to pay an extra $70 each because we wanted to make a tee time in advance for 4 people.

I, along with my group members, were seriosly disapointed in the overall experience. The course itself was nice.  A great layout with nice views and in good shape.  The greens were a little sandy and definitely slower than we all expected.  The reason I gave this such a poor rating is because of the player experience.  I would consider myself and frequent golfer, playing weekly and over 40 times per season.  This was low on the list in terms of customer service, experience, and value.  As a group we all spent $2200 at this course, and we were treated as if we were a burden on them.  After showing up on the first tee - we were rudely greeted by the starter who couldnt even crack a smile.  Sorry but after paying the 300 dollar tab, I would expect a smile out of your starter.  The bag drop attendents did not even offer to pick up our bags or walk out to greet us, they thought it would be better to continue to talk to themselves.  We were also the first tee time so there were no other guests to even greet.  Then while being rushed off the first tee and given no guidance on the course, we were told it was cart path only for the entire 36 holes.  I get why they did this but they should warn their customers before booking of these rules.  This was awful as we would have to unstrap our bags and walk across the entire fairway.  Then - we got told to hurry up our play because.  This would have been ok to do but if we didnt have to walk across the entire fairway with our bags because we did not know any yardages (no markers on sidewalks or birdhouses for a 150).  The food on the turn was a notch above cafeteria food at my high school. If I paid 50 dolalrs to play each course i wouldnt have been as mad, but for this price - this course should rival Streamsong, Bandon Dunes, Pelican Hill, The Ocean Course and so on.

It is wide open, so even if you spray it off the tee, its no big deal.  Its relatively cheap in the summer, but there are better deals.  In the winter, I won't go near the course, too overpriced.\n\nHowever, as I have grown in my game, I find Western Skies to be sub par in many areas.  Worst bunkers in all of golf.  If, and that is a big IF, there is any sand in the bunkers it is rock hard.  The grass is patchy at best and never in good shape.  The fairways are rock hard and I would have to agree that the greens are extremely inconsistent.  If you read my other post about Dobson Ranch, you will know the other thing I covet is great customer service.\n\nWhen I come into the clubhouse to complain that a round of golf took 6 hours, I don't want to hear excuses, I want apologies.  Western Skies usually books tee times ever 7 minutes as opposed to the standard 8 or even 9.  The rangers are never out on the course and they over book their tournaments.  This is just another course where the primary concern is not how can we provide a world class golfing experience, but how can we get one extra group on so we can make a few more dollars.\n\nNeedless to say, I haven't played this track in years and have no plans on doing so in the near future.",0.0,0.9987009763717652

They did not appear to be punched recently and there was no aerification alert on GolfNow either.  I teed off around 7:00 or so and it was threesomes and foursomes one right after the other.  So, the grounds keepers decide that is an appropriate time to water?  Seriously?  We hit into water sprinklers on holes 4-9.  Every hole!  I called the clubhouse from the 9th fairway and was basically told that they were on timers and there was nothing they could do.  So, they would rather turn them on during the busiest part of their week and make the customers suffer.  That's nice.  There has always been issues with their help anyway.  Discourtesy and lack of etiquette.  Mowing the back tees while you are trying to hit from the regular, refusing to get off the green while you are trying to hit your approach etc.\n\nSo, today, I figured I would give them another shot.  Big mistake.  The fairways this time were what was horrible.  When was the last time they were mowed?  I am not exaggerating when I tell you the length of the fairways was somewhere between the length of normal rough and the second cut.  It was TERRIBLE.  Plus, they decided to water again while people were out there which really brought out all the bugs.\n\nIt was the most uncomfortable round of golf I have ever played and I just got done playing 45 holes this weekend in 115 degree heat!  \n\nThey have lost a customer.

With temps barely crossing 50 for only a few hours each day, I'm not sure how they justify $60 per round.

If you compared the course today to what the pictures or video show online, they are totally misleading.  Again, maybe this is a seasonal thing where the rough all dries up and turns yellow, but the all/most of the greats seemed to be a brownish color with patches of bright green which might have been a fungus or something because it looked like a lot of tiny 3-4 leaf clovers packed together....but what do I know, I don't have a turf management degree.\n\nMost of the course plays down hill and is set up to offer favorable bounces helping you get from the rough to the fairway off the tee.  However, the bunkers are awful..mostly filled with rocks.  In many spots it wasn't just a few pebbles, they were rocks...stuff that will scratch/knick/ding up your clubs unless you give yourself relief.  The best thing about the course were the views.  You can see almost the entire valley and beautiful Vegas scenery...but that still doesn't justify the rates.  I could probably stomach a $30-$35 round here this time of year, but not $60...especially when you can head north to Paiute and play a course in mint condition for $40.

I know what to expect when golfing on a hot summer day. \n\nThat being said, golfing at the Revere was one of the worst experiences I have had golfing in Las Vegas, and I have played quite a few rounds. First, my foursome arrived and wanted to hit some balls at the range. However, there were no balls available at the range, so the four of us collected balls  that were 10-20 yards down the range so that we could at least get a warm up in. This was after calling the clubhouse and waiting about ten minutes for someone to bring more balls, that never even came. \n\nWe played the Lexington Course, and the course layout is great. Fun holes, fun tee boxes, blind shots, a unique course well-designed. \n\nHowever, after playing the front 9, at the turn we wanted more of the bottled water that comes with the round. However, there was no bottled water left, and the cart girl had stopped service around 2 PM (we only saw her on the second hole, never again). Keep in mind that it was 105 degrees, and there are no jugs of water anywhere on the course. We played without water the next hour and 15 minutes until there was a water fountain following the 13th hole. For a course not to provide water during the hot summer months in Las Vegas is pathetic. If you have ever played golf in Las Vegas during the summer, you know that you can easily drink an entire bottle every hole or every other hole. \n\nFinally, if you hit into a sand trap, you were essentially either hitting out of a concrete bed or clay, the sand was terrible. \n\nAll in all, my first experience at the Revere was downright awful.

Today the course was in excellent condition, the grass on the tee boxes was a little long and some is the sand traps were not taken care of ( hard and wet ), but the fairways were in great condition as well as the greens. Now I know everyone says 4 to 4 1/2 hours is an acceptable time to play a round of golf but I don't agree with that, anyone can easily shave off an hour at least if they just played the game and acted like they were pros. It took our group 4 1/2 hours to play 18 holes today and on a few tee boxes there were two to three groups backed up all because one group ahead of us had no time management or common courtesy to move along at a quicker pace, they would wait until the group ahead of them cleared the green before teeing off and from the way I saw them hitting the ball, there was no need for them to wait, there was also no marshal on the course to help move along play, I know my group can and has played a round in about three and a half hours and we are not rushing at all. It's just a sad state that someone, somewhere said it should take that long to play a round and so people make it take that long and I have noticed that the more people that watch golf on tv they try to mimic their favorite folders by doing what they do, it's just sad to see that it's taking longer and longer to get in a round of golf and the courses don't and will not do anything to speed up play. I have a few favorites in Vegas I play weekly and I will stick with them because the play is quicker, players know they are not pros and never will be and just want to get out and play, and the courses are in great shape all year round, but I'm going to keep those my secret as to not get the hackers that think they are pros out there and mess up that good thing, and they treat you better than these other \"" golf clubs\"" ever will.

There's a small practice green too.\n\n- It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).\n\n- Decent condition.  This golf course is kept in nice shape throughout the year.\n\nCONS\n- It's a short course.  6,512 yds from the tips, 6,017 from the white, 5,579 from the gold....ladies tees are 5,099.\n\n- Limited food selection.  There's not much in terms of food....a small snack bar.\n\n- Limited pro-shop.  They have the basics, but nothing worth purchasing.  They don't have too many high end products here.\n\n- Sometimes there is no beer cart on the course.  This happens when the course is slow....they won't bother to send out a beer cart.  I don't drink while playing, but I like to have a few Gatorades & Water.\n\nOverall, it's not too bad.

I play here about 75 times a year. Recently they had a management change. For some reason  they forgot about the golfers who supported them when times were tough. The changes that they are making are great for the course. Just remember the local guys are the one replacing divots, spending money in the restaurant and making a effort to support you guys even when you burn the greens or the fairways on 13. If you keep up your changes, the locals we will find another place to play. Now with that being said the course is playing well. There has been some new ways of keeping the course in good condition. They are mowing early and raking the bunkers. This has helped them  become more consistent. The layout is fair for every golfer. There's not much trouble and even errant shots are forgiven by desert surrounds and lack of trees. Take your wedges because it is generally driver,short iron wedge type course. The front has a little water but bring your gas mask. All in all I would rate Rhodes a 5 out if 10. Worth at the most for 18 holes $30 to $45 a round. A great practice course at best.

Temporary greens on full 18 holes until Mid-August of 2012.  \n\nFor those unfamiliar with temporary greens, allow me to explain:\n\nAt the end of the fairway before it ends as it is approaching the green, the fairway grass is cut a little bit lower in a circular shape to represent the green.  The temporary hole is approximately twice as big.  The temporary greens' grass is not tended to and will result in uneven slope throughout.  The loss of yardage for the entire course must be near 720yds--avg was about 20, but one hole was shortened 76 yds.\n\nTemporary green play really takes away from this course leaving much to be desired.

My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest.

Southern Ridge Golf course or as it was formerly known as Bougainvilla is unfortunately on the latter side. The value is here (I think we paid 15 a person on GolfNow) but Its hardly worth it.

There have been a lot of changes both for the good and the bad.\n\nThis is a classic William Bell design, with elevated tees and greens, mostly bunkered in the front. It's compact in design and everything flows together well, and there are some great risk reward opportunities. Some of the standout holes are:\n\n#3, a great 420yd par 4 dogleg right. It is really tempting to try to cut the corner, and if you hit a right side drive high enough, you can carry the mounds and trees and leave yourself a short wedge in. Hit in the trees and its an easy bogey.\n\n#5 is a very tempting driving hole. at 302 yards one can put the ball on the green if you hit even a somewhat long ball. If you miss either way, you'll have a tough time saving par. I've probably had less pars here than any other hole on the course, its always birdie or bogey.\n\n#13 is very much the same situation as 5, but you have a huge bunker in front of the green. Again, a big shot off the tee can put you in a great birdie position, or a nice cut will put you on the green, but bogie is easy. \n\nThe place is never in good shape, but the course is fun, it's cheap, and appropriate for the advanced player or a beginner.

After the tournament we'll close the course for the work then\""\n\nWe paid our money and went to carts.   the attendants informed us the driving area was closed due to mowing and it would be quite a while before it would open.  Ok, no problem, we chipped around and when our tee time was up we went to first tee.  I guess we should have actually looked at course before we paid.  Upon arriving at first tee box.  All the fairways were brown.  The attendant informed us that  growth retardant had been sprayed 2 days before and he was amazed it worked in such a short time.  He also went on to say he played a round the day before and it was playable but just brown.  I grumbled about the fact I had asked if any work was done and was lied to but we teed off and started our round.  Since it was a business outing we were kind of stuck.  \n\nOn the fairway... not only was the growth retardant sprayed but all the grass was removed by mowing very short.  It was a goat patch.  Every shot in the fairway for the whole course was pretty much hitting off a little dead grass or dirt. \nAround the greens the second cut was done the same way.  A little further out there was some 2\"" Bermuda rough. \n\nSo basically we paid to play either in Bermuda rough or off the dirt, tee to green.  \n\nNeedless to say, I feel I was deceived into paying for a round on a course that was completely unplayable and worse our business outing was ruined.  \n\nJust on principal, I probably won't waste the time to go back and see if it is a good course with actual grass on the fairways and around greens.  \n\nGreens were good.

The practice facility is good and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed, you certainly do not feel like you are at Bushwood from Caddyshack. The service is great and I saw the cart girl probably every 3.5 holes, very good.  I would rate this club probably in the high middle range for private courses in AZ.

I never saw the pro, so I didn't spend a dime in the pro shop other than the greens fee.\n\nWith all the repair work, I probably wouldn't bother with that course for a couple of years, if I was to go back at all.

Usually if it's lift clean and place, it's because of a horrible storm and the conditions are already muddy, and it's almost always within a scorecard length (8-12 inches). This time it had to be a full club-length because that's what it took to find a good lie in many cases.   I understand having some bad lies, its part of the game, but 90% of the lies out here are pretty sketchy.

She told me that instead of being able to watch her son play, she went back to the hotel and sat in the room.

Only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the cart attendant in the morning was really friendly, and the greens had potential and lots of grass and the layout is in fact kind of fun. 5 par 3's on the course and they are all pretty tough. \n2 stars and it's debatable to be that nice.",0.0,0.9996415376663208

I was instructed to \"" look for the white man with dark brown hair\"". Yes, really. At a golf course I was sent to look for a white man. That was literally everyone there except for me, her and my boyfriend. So, after one unsuccessful lap around looking for the pro, I returned to the desk to get more specific instructions. We did finally find him and our lesson commenced. He was a great guy and I am happy that he gave us our first lesson. I was only bothered that during our lesson he put his hand on my head (part of the lesson) to hold it down without asking permission. It was my first lesson, so perhaps this is normal?

It's a 9 hole par 3 course. A good place for tourists to come and get a quick 9 in.\n\nThe golf shop and restaurant are okay... Both are a little pricey, but what do you expect for something so close to the resort corridor?\n\nThe driving range on the other hand is deplorable. It's 90% mats (hitting off turf is an extra $3 per bucket), which is fine. Unfortunately the new management has yet to upgrade them since taking over. The mats are really old and sun-worn. What makes it worse is the fact that the mats are simply laid down on concrete. There is nothing to anchor them down. Consequently, if you swing with any type of power and/or torque, the mat will slide. This is more pronounced when taking a full swing with longer irons, woods, and your driver. As someone who's big and strong (6'4\"" 240#), the movement and instability of the mat is awful. You start to lose all confidence because of the instability and loss of connection with the ground.\n\nThe Taylor Made Golf Center needs to look at other driving ranges that have a better setup with their mats: e.g. Dessert Pines has their mats framed in so they don't move at all.\n\nThis place was once a really nice place to come.

Carts are silent electric and have GPS. \n\nThere are 3 nines. Desperado, Diablo and Outlaw. Outlaw has a great par5  finishing hole protected by water. Greens are in great shape and roll quickly.  I would recommend getting a course guide at the pro shop to get familiar with the greens. Because the pin placement on quite a few holes were brutal. (in the middle of a slope- leaving an impossible putt if you were above the hole)\n\nAlso, they place their tee times 10 minutes apart instead of the 8 minutes that other courses do.

Before I talk about my experience I wish to add that the course itself is in a poor location and very difficult to find (especially one new to the Charlotte area). Being that it is pretty much directly across from Providence Golf Club I got lost (of course) and missed my tee time.\n\nUpon first entering, was greeted by the golf head professional who seemed very nice and did not mind that I was late for my tee time once I explained the fact that I did get lost. He helped me out by giving me the twilight special.  I did wish to purchase a golf glove, however, they had no inventory given the recent changes in management.\n\nThe course was not in great shape even given the amount of rain Charlotte has gotten. The fairways were not mowed well and in places where they were mowed the \""mowed\"" grass was all over the fairways. Although it is a \""links\"" course much of the heather I noticed has been mowed. Most of the bunkers were unplayable and were not kept in great shape. Lastly, the greens were EXTREMELY long which I attribute from the ownership being changed and the previous owners not taking good care of the course.\n\nReally enjoyed the layout of the course and the course is very narrow and has the potential to be a VERY difficult and fun course to play. My rating reflects the potential I believe this course has and I really really hope the owners clean it up, keep the bunkers, cut the greens properly, and add heather in the appropriate places I really think this course has the potential to be a great course. I will for sure be back to see the progress. Thanks again to the courtesy staff!",0.0,0.9937384128570556

Maybe in a couple months I will be a good enough golfer to write a review about the actual course portion. In the mean time...\n\nWe went to the driving range at about 4pm on a Saturday. There were quite a bit of people there, but we didn't have to wait for a spot on the range, although we did have to wait for one of the range workers to bring us a token for our second bucket of balls, which he did before we finished our first bucket, so all was good. My dad said that this was the busiest he had seen it. \n\nAs far as the actual driving range itself, I think it was in okay condition. They have the colored flags that let you know how far your ball went (or in some cases, didn't go), which were pretty easy to see, but the grass was only in fair condition. The balls were also a little worn out, and yellow, which I thought was a bit odd. I'd like to blame this for many of my poor shots. I'd like to, but I won't. Overall, on the scientific scale I devised, Dad says this was just about in the middle on a scale of Fiddlesticks to TPC Scottsdale. \n\nThe grass and equipment could have been maintained better, but for the price for a couple buckets of balls ($6 for two buckets, I think), it's a pretty fair deal.  \n\nOn the plus side, they also offer putting practice greens as well as an area for practicing chip shots out of the bunker. Not that I will ever be hitting any balls into bunkers. Right. \n\nA big thanks to my dad, Norm for his expertise, and to my sister, for leaving her golf clubs here when she moved back to Florida, thus allowing me to explore my newfound hobby.",0.0,0.9786862134933472

Although it wasn't a problem for me, I did hear several people comment on it.\n\nAll in all, quite a pleasant experience. Not many carries, a very nice course, with interesting, if not challenging holes (that is, if you can keep your tee shots straight).

The 2 stars could easily be changed and turned to a 4 or 5 with some work in the clubhouse, and minor changes. Here's my story... I was playing in the afternoon, 3:04 pm to be exact. After we paid the higher than normal fees for summer rates for the area, we then were informed to have the carts back by 6 cuz they close at 6. So, we can't get a full round in, paid the same for an afternoon rate that we'd have gotten at noon. No twilight rate?!? Absurd. And the guy in clubhouse waited for us to pay, then remind us. Not when we booked it, or walked in. Then he made the comment that \""if you hurry, you could make it\"" Who wants to rush and hurry in golf. It should be enjoyed. So the next complaint- absolutely NO water for drinking on the course. I don't call the drinking fountains acceptable in AZ summer heat. You could've made hot tea with that water out of the fountains. And NO bev cart. This is understandable for the bev cart during the slow summer season, but please keep the holes stocked with fresh cool water for drinking. Especially during the July AZ summers. All in all, the course was in great shape. I wouldn't mind paying higher summer rate since course was in great shape. I will return only because I work across the street.",0.0,0.9861316680908204

Staff & other golfers didn't seem near as polite as the other 2 courses we had tried.\n\nRight after the 1st hole we had a group of 4 older men yelling at us to \""hurry up\"" from their tee box.

It also didn't hurt that I was playing on Super Bowl Sunday afternoon.  \n\nFrom the first tee, I could tell that I was going to appreciate and enjoy this course.  The tee boxes were cut cleanly, the fairways were impeccable, bunkers were well-maintained with collared tan bermuda  and, as with any Troon managed golf course, the rough was green and slightly penalizing - unlike other courses that don't seed their rough.  The greens, though, were a mixed lot.  All of them were slick and rolled true but a good majority of them were peppered with unfixed ball marks and golf shoe pocks.  I might be nitpicking here because the greens were by no means damaged and such.  \n\nThe course itself is very straightforward and flat.

All the starter said was, \""The putts break away from the towers, have a good time.\"" At the ritzy, uptight courses, the starters or marshals seem to read you the constitution before you can even tee off. \n    The course was in decent shape. The greens rolled true and there were a few that were two-tiered. The fairways had just been aerated, but I wouldn't knock a course for that. It's maintenance that has to be done. The \""desert\"" areas weren't necessarily  desert areas, but spots were ground was cleared and stuff never grew back.\n     As far as the layout, It was designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish, two well-known course designers. The front nine wasn't horribly difficult, while the back was markedly tougher. There was four sets of tees, with the black (or back) tees stretching out to just over 7,000 yards. There were some tough holes with deep, steep-faced, green-side bunkers, but only a few fairway bunkers. Water came into play on four holes, but there were no long carries over the water. All of the par fives were reachable in two, while the par threes were of the shorter variety. One of the nicer aspects of the course was that not too many holes were laid out next to each other, so you don't have to dodge errant shots from golfers playing the neighboring holes. The drawback to this is the course winds through housing developments and the views of the mountains are obscured.\n    The clubhouse seemed nice with a small bar for drinks and sandwiches. The pro shop was adequate with the necessities but didn't have too much in terms of equipment. To buy clubs and such from a golf course pro-shop isn't the most frugal decision anyways. They did have a clearance rack of shirts at good prices.\n    Foothills is a course I would play again, as well as recommend to others.

Then to cap it off, not only did they overbook as usual, but they let a 5-some with 4 women go out in front of us!!!!   And they were all clearly beginner golfers with no etiquette.  We had to skip a hole to get past them because they wouldn't let us play through.. The other 2 guys in out group went home after 2 1/2 holes it was so bad!!!\n\nNever playing here again!!!!!!

This is a fine golf course.  I found it to be well maintained and in good condition.  It is not an extremely challenging course, but it is good.  There are a lot of trees on this course, which is rather unusual for a desert location.  The only bad thing is that the course does not seem to drain very well.  A rain shower had gone through early in the morning on the day I played and there were several areas of standing water on the course.  Ther ewas actually on spot on the cart path on the 18th hole where the water was about a foot deep!  I didn't think I was going to get the cart through it.\n\nThere are higher quality courses in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, but this one is better than a lot of courses in most communities.

Most unprepared ball marks I've ever seen, course is ridiculously soft and the greens are not only hairy (rolling about 6) they also didn't even mow the first foot of the green all the way around.  All in all, for what they charge, they should be ashamed at the conditions.  They claim a PGA Tour Experience, but no PGA Tour player would put up with these embarrassing conditions.\n\n      Last, I'll say that our caddies, while nice guys, were a BIG part of the problem.  I've played Bandon Dunes, Chambers Bay, Torrey Pines, Pebble and many other caddie clubs.  TPC Caddies are the worst trained I've ever seen.  They are a big part of the maintenance issue.  Finally, after watching both caddies not fix a ball mark or fill a divot in 5 holes...I told them I expected each of them to fix 3 ball marks per hole at minimum and to fill as many divots as they could.  Embarrassing for the course for me to have to tell them that.  Whoever is training the caddies should be fired!!\n\n       I also played Grayhawk and Weekopah.  One thousand percent difference.  Both greens were good, courses well maintained and service was great.  \n\n        Of all the golf I've played, I'd say if you pay less than $90 to play Stadium Course,  it's worth it.
