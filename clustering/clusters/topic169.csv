The problem is really threefold.\n\nOne is that there are so many options.  Even if you get the \""full creation\"", with which you can get any of the throw ins, it's rather overwhelming.\n\nTwo is that they aren't presented in a way that the options are easy to understand.  the full creation comes with any of the thrown ins, while with the junior creation comes with a set amount (four, I think) and you pay for each additional one.  That's easy enough, but then you pick lettuce, then you pick the throw ins, then you pick a protein (extra choice, even if you choose a full creation), then you pick a dressing, then you choose if you want it tossed or chopped.  It's just too much!\n\nThree is that the options add up (in price) really, really fast.  If you don't like the full creation ($6-9) and go for the junior (approx $2 less), you can easily make up the difference in throw ins - just four will make up the difference in price, not to mention the size of the salad itself.  There is also no simple explanation of size difference (you can ask to see a bowl, but it doesn't really help visualize the difference).  To top it all off - literally - if you want chicken or something on your salad, you're adding to the cost no matter which salad you ordered.\n\nThey also have paninis and wraps, as well as soups, but let's face it - you went for a salad, right?  That's like going to Subway for a salad, or ordering a pizza from a sandwich shop.  Hmm.  Guess that does happen.\n\nWhat they need is a model more like Subway and less like you're going to get picked to death on every little thing you put on the salad.\n\nWhile the quality of the salad itself is pretty decent, trying to figure out the menu board and what goes with what without just getting bowled over (sorry) by what you can order without being taken is too much.\n\nThat said, the staff is friendly, and the double-pizza-cutter that chops up the salad is neat to watch - probably worth ordering yours chopped just for that reason.

Added the organic baked tofu, black beans, corn, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and then added some greek vinaigrette on the side.  My total was 8.10, which was a little pricier than I bargianed for, but it all looked fresh so I was ok with this.  I do like that if I were to order directly off the menu, they have calorie counts available for all their selectioins listed right beside the item name, which is REALLY great, since almost nowhere does this; very convienent for those watching their intake.  Anyways, I ate at one of the many tables they have available outside, which is in a pretty secluded area that is aesthetically pleasing, so I really enjoyed this aspect.  Unfortunately, the salad itself lacked a little.  For one, none of the items tasted very fresh except for the lettuce, and the cherry tomatoes tasted almost stale.  The tofu was also very bland, and although the menu never stated it would be seasoned with anything, I just assumed they would have added some sort of spice since it is afterall, tofu.  \n\nTo be fair, I did just move to the area from Charleston, SC so I have been spoiled with really great, local fresh food at most restaurants, but based on the description I was really hoping this would be a taste of the freshness at home, which unfortunately it was not.  Don't get me wrong, I ate the whole thing and it wasn't awful by any means, just definitely a little bit of a let down from my high expectations after seeing reviews.\n\nSuggestions?  I know it's not strictly salads, but they really should work on upgrading their salad selections because I feel like a lot of people go to a healthy store like this for salad, and especially at that price point customers should be getting a little bit better quality.  Also, a selection rather than just one type of lettuce would be really nice.  \n\nAnyways, overall average experience food-wise, really nice atmosphere though and I may return one day for a sandwich or something, but for now I'll continue on my hunt for the freshest Charlotte salad I can find.",1.0,0.9114884734153748

I'm used to fresh, organic, local ingredients and house-made salad dressings for a reasonable price.\n\nHello Bistro's produce, unfortunately, is all pretty sad-looking and tasteless. The tomatoes were pale pink and mealy, rather than red and juicy, and all the other veggies appear to come straight from a can and are floating in water. Sure, they've got a decent variety of ingredients, but they're all pretty poor in quality. Plus, what's up with the salad greens selection? I want some arugula or some baby spinach! I'm not a huge meat-eater so I didn't add any meat to my salad, but all of the meat options looked pretty lifeless. I do appreciate the unlimited number of veggie toppings and that cheese and a few meat selections are without an additional charge, though. This makes the pricing reasonable, but I expect higher quality ingredients from a $7 salad.\n\nI want someone to open a higher quality salad place in Oakland! I would go there all the time.

Healthy fast food... what a concept!  Had a fantastic salad here... and kept on running my errands!  Other fast food attempt the salad thing and some come close but nothing like this place.  This is the only business I've bookmarked in Yelp so I can plan future errand runs to include a stop here...THANK YOU!,0.0,0.9288978576660156

I ordered the beet salad ($7) with added steak ($3) and a fountain drink. The salad was nicely sized and I'm a big guy. The added steak was under seasoned but They gave me a lot of it. The dressing ratio on the salad was perfect. I wish the salad had a bit more goat cheese based on how much steak I received. The fountain drinks are not typical sodas but flavored agave nectar sodas. They are tasty but foam up a lot so it is a pain to get a full cup without constantly pouring out the foam head. On the whole I recommend this place and will be back soon.,1.0,0.9982557892799376

Used to be good few months ago when it had just opened but recently since about a month ago they changed their containers and have become very stingy with their portions. You order a medium soup cup but will get only half cup (equivalent to small) I had ordered their Gallon soups too which come in a small bucket (not even close to half gallon).  Same goes with the salads, very less quantity and ingredients.  If you add chicken to your salads you get couple small pieces of chicken (not worth paying extra).  I ordered chicken Enchilada soup, you have to pay extra if you need to sprinkle with half a spoon of cheese or sour cream!!!\nYou need to order 3 salads to make it equal to one regular salad from other restaurants.\nI had just tried the Glendale location, not sure if all other locations are like that too!",0.0,0.9976200461387634

The bread was a warmed hoagie roll.\nI don't think they make anything from scratch.  \nI hate to be so negative but I don't think they are really trying!

I ordered the santa fe salad.  Service was friendly and fast. Was a little disappointed in the amount of ingredients compared to the amount of lettuce and not enough dressing for the size (ordered on the side and dipped and ran out with a lot of salad left). Have since read in review comments that you can ask for extra veggies at no cost (minus the expensive toppibgs like cheese, avocado, meat, etc). Not sure about dressing. I also ordered a diet soda (no brand provided but wasn't coke or pepsi). I paid $3 for a large. Soda wasn't very big for that price and  was mostly ice. Now that I know I can order with extra veggies, I will go back but won't order a soda.  Overall, really good and convenient to get restaurant like salads easily on my way home.  Definitely a better option than the other fast food places in the area. They have other items besides salads: soups,  wraps, smoothies, and healthy breakfast items.",0.0,0.594878077507019

I asked for no grilled onions and light on the pepper -- when I received my plate, their were onions and peppers all over the place.
