While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore!

The server took about 10 minutes just to come greet us and she wasn't even busy. We weren't notified of any specials whatsoever even though it was Happy Hour. We placed our order and 3 minutes later we decided we wanted to change something to the order and the server told us the order was already almost done? Please tell me how my order was almost done considering I order the Chicken Penne. No matter what chicken and pasta takes about 10 minutes to be well prepared. And when the food came out it was disgusting. The pasta was chewy and hard and the chicken was pink and not throughly cooked. Which is why it only took 5 minutes to make.

It took them an hour and a half for then to tell us this. We were expected to eat without silverware and asked for ketchup twice before it Appeared after the food got cold.

I showed up about 20 minutes after I placed my order.  I had very quick service when it came to ringing me up and paying.  Then I waited, thinking my food would be ready soon.  \nIn total it took about 50 minutes from the time I ordered to get my food.  While I was waiting I was not recognized by any of the staff, only in the way as far as I could tell.  The one very disturbing thing I did see that, more than just the general uncleanliness of the restaurant, would make me not go back, was that one of the waiters (who appeared to be the manager), came out of the kitchen with an entr\u00e9e he was about to take to one of the tables, grabbed a fork from over where the dirty dishes were (I only hope the fork he took was from a clean pile, b/c they had been putting dirty dishes in that area since I got there), and scraped off parts of the noodle dish into the trash before taking that plate to one of the tables.\n\nThe food itself was on par in my opinion with Little Dumplings and several of the other local thai places I have visited in the area as far as the Pad Thai is concerned (had 7 star spicy).  I only hope this was a one time incident b/c that was the first time I had ever seen anything like that happen in a restaurant (though other restaurants may do the same, but I had never seen that before).\n\nI hope I just visited them in an off night, but there are enough other places in the area I could go that I will not be going back to Thai Basil.",0.0,0.998530387878418

I know that the woman who works the front counter there is great at interpreting what you want and helping you order, but I wasn't expecting such thorough service on the phone! She made sure I was ordering exactly what I wanted (and asked me if I wanted the authentic Chinese recipe- of course I do!) Then, she offered to have it ready in ten minutes, or hold the order until a time of my choosing.\n\nI got there and met the nice lady who took my order, who immediately recognized me.

I have been to Crispy Crepe in the past and have had a wonderful experience. However, my visit this morning was disappointing. The place was packed with a 15 minute wait for two people, but we were sat quicker than that. Since we've been there before, we knew what we wanted to order - 2 simple crepes. After 20 minutes of no food, our server came by and apologized, saying that it should be right up, that the kitchen was very backed up. Ten more minutes went by and we still got nothing. There was a man who seemed to be the manager wandering around so my mom went to speak with him regarding our orders. He had no idea we had been waiting 30 minutes for our food. Our server came by again and elaborated on the reason why we had been waiting so long - that their ticket machine was not working properly and some orders had not been printed, then all of a sudden several were printed all at once, causing a mishap and back up. We understood this and were glad that she was honest about what was going on. Right after this, our food came. It was hot, fresh, and tasted great. Our server was very apologetic about our experience. However, we received our bill and expected at least one of our meals to be comped - or at least something else offered for our EXTREMELY long wait for only two easy meals. We were charged fully with no apology from the manager. So, we called him over to explain how we felt. Rather than trying to accommodate and apologize for the inconvenience we experienced, he basically just told us \""30 minutes is a TYPICAL wait for food on a sunday\"". I proceeded to tell him that we had been there before and had no such experience. He then questioned me \""was that a sunday?\"" and after I said yes he simply raised his eyebrows. No apology or honest explanation about the mixed up/backed up orders in the kitchen. He reluctantly gave us a 15% discount off of our meal. Thanks for the $3.00 off. I will definitely question whether to give my business to someone like this again.",0.0,0.9953590035438538

We ordered 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in an attempt to have a \""quick meal\"" before hitting the pool. We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge, our main criteria being somewhere in walking distance that is \""outside with strip view.\"" That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words. \n\nAfter 30 minutes, we inquired into the existence of our grilled cheeses. I am positive this is when our order first made it to the kitchen. Another 15 minutes later, we had to walk inside to complain about waiting 45 minutes for a grilled cheese. 20 minutes later, still no grilled cheese. You would think they would make it a priority after MULTIPLE complaints. The place was more than half empty. After speaking with the manager, I explained as politely as possible that it's just 4 pieces of bread and cheese with some avocado and bacon inside and not duck a l'Orange. Following such a complaint, it should have been made within 10 minutes. Over an hour after our arrival, and after watching the table next to us sit, order, eat, pay, and leave, we had our sandwiches. I am adding the 2nd star because they actually tasted really good, despite being VERY heavy, and because the manager comped our meal, which included 2 beers. Of course they also got our bill completely wrong, which added to their reasons for comping our meal. The manager claimed he \""doesn't know what went wrong\"" with the hour plus wait for our simple meal. Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food. When this place closes down soon, I will definitely \""know what went wrong\"" with it.",0.0,0.9989014863967896

Got the drinks right away, and chips and guacamole came almost one hour later. We kept asking the server about our appetizer and she said the kitchen is slow and our order would be out soon................NOT!!! We ordered our shrimp tacos and received them 40 min. later.
