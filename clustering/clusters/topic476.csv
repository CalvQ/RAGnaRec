Anyone who does yoga in Phoenix should go to Desert Song, and at least try out the amazing classes. There's a $30 all-you-can-yoga 2-week pass, and it's definitely worth it. If you don't feel that you get anything out of the classes, it's probably your own fault: all the instructors ask what people would like to work on, what your energy level is like tonight, give you options if you want to push yourself and help you improve your posture and position. If you go to class willing to speak up and ready to learn, you will love Desert Song.\n\nIn particular, Mary Beth is a great teacher who varies her classes so you always get a good workout or stretch, and you don't get bored. I worked my vacation schedule around when Mary Beth was teaching so I could go to her all-levels. Thanks to Ana C's glowing rec, I also tried a class with Ellen. Score there, too. Also tried out a yoga flow class (and though I can't remember the instructor's name, but I think you're getting the picture. Great people all around). \n\nFor people who have injuries, Desert Song is WONDERFUL. When you check in at the beginning of class, (you sign in at the front desk) the instructor asks you if you have any limitations or concerns. You don't have to announce that you're post-op or that you have a bad knee, and your instructors bend over backwards to make sure everyone works at their own level and is accommodated with a pose modification that will be right for him or her.\n\nReally, as good as it gets.",1.0,0.9996591806411744

There's no flow to it.  You start with warmup, then work your way to weights and then suddenly you're doing abs and then barre work?  I don't feel as comfortable with a lot of the low back stuff as I do with PB or Physique because I don't have the same amount of support.  Also, during the entire class it's difficult to understand the teacher's instructions as they're EXPLAINING every little move that you make.  Breathe in, hold it, tuck...am I supposed to be tucking?

The mixed barre class is appropriate for women of all skill levels- you don't feel like a loser if you can't do everything, yet even dancers get a great workout.  This class is great for stretching and toning.

It's like working out with a trainer without paying the price of a trainer. Their Mixed Barre class works the whole body.... of course, it is all about a strong core, concentrating on specific areas for specific movements.  I've only been to 3 Mixed Barre classes and so far each of them has been different which is really great. I've been to 1 Cardio Yoga class and it's a fantastic class.  It's Yoga with some cardio mixed in.  It's hard to explain, but you work up a nice sweat and get the heart rate going so ... it works.  :)  \n\nUnlike going to the gym (which I see as a chore), I actually look forward to the Barre classes.  :)\n\nYes, I hurt from all the leg, butt and shoulder moves.... but it's a \""good\"" hurt... meaning.... muscles hurt that I didn't even know were muscles.  (Probably because they are weak-ass muscles, but I know after more Barre classes.... I won't be so sore.)\n\nI recommend at least trying 1 class.

However, I've noticed that some newbies will attend a handful of classes, seem awfully discouraged, then are never seen again.  This review is aimed at those gals.\n\nIt is intimidating to be \""the new girl\"" in a class where everyone seems to be effortlessly doing all the moves correctly.  Ask your toned and flexible neighbor on the mat how long she's been working out with PB and you'll find that it's been at least three months.   Based on my very unscientific survey, that's about how long it takes to reach the point where you can do all the exercises with some grace, assuming you aren't a dancer, etc. and already in top form.  Many newbies can't straighten their raised leg while doing ab work on the mat against the wall.  Guess what?  Most of us couldn't at the beginning.  Most of us also couldn't last through an entire session of \""little up, little down\"".  It took time and practice.  The workout is tough, but you will see results.  \n\nThink you look clumsy?  We all did at first.  Some of us still do when a new move is introduced.  No one cares.  Everyone is there to work out, not to judge.  There's no competition; we are all in pain.  The Lululemon fetish is probably a little overwhelming for newcomers who have not been assimilated by that particular borg, but it isn't a snobbish vibe.  Those outfits are just cute, but a t-shirt and an old pair of leggings works just as well. \n\nThe instructors are phenomenal.  They are funny, encouraging, and will definitely push you.  Several have dance and/or yoga training as well, which is a plus because they will notice and will reposition you so that you don't hurt yourself.\n\nIf you decide to give it a try, force yourself to go to at least three classes a week for a month, don't do a class here and a class there.  The new client special makes that affordable.  Whatever you do, don't give up after just three classes.",1.0,0.9743221998214722

I went on a purchased Groupon, which was 2 classes for the price of 1. \n\nWhat I liked: \nThe atmosphere: I did really like the minimalist / modern decor. It's cool and fits right in with its uptown location.\nThe class itself: It was relatively low impact, and only about a third of the class was actually using the barre (the beginning was arms, the middle on the barre, and the end abs / stretching). The instructor was great, and the class size was good. I do wish we had spent more time on the barre.\nThe locker room was very clean and nicely arranged (although there are only 2 showers, which could mean waiting a while after a lunchtime class).\n\nWhat I didn't like so much:\nPrice: This place is pretty expensive. It was okay to take 2 classes with the Groupon, but to join full time is a lot of money to only have access to about 3-4 different kinds of classes. I am a full time Y member, and for a lot less money they offer many different choices.\nMats: When we arrived (I went with a friend, who'd also purchased the Groupon), the guy at the front desk asked if we had mats. We said no, we didn't know we needed them. \""It's in the course descpription\"" was the answer; though no one reminded us of this when we registered for the class. We had to pay $2 each to rent a mat for a 1 hour class. $2!!! Definitely a rip off. For my 2nd class have no doubt that I will remember to bring my own. I mean, $2!!!\nThe windows: The exercise room is right at street level on the corner of Stonewall / Church St., and it is totally windowed. So people are constantly walking by and staring. Maybe I am extra self conscious, but that was distracting to me, and at times in the class it made me pretty uncomfortable (like when men are walking by and starting at a class full of women doing hip thrusts). Also, my guess is that in the summer being in that room is like being in a fishbowl of magnifying glasses; meaning, won't it be really hot in there?\n\nOverall - it was a pretty okay experience to try a different kind of class with the Groupon, but I wouldn't pay the regular price for a class, not would I consider becoming a member full time.",0.0,0.8857844471931458

Considering I've gone to the Daily Method and been in classes as big as 20. YUCK! You just can't get the individualized attention, in that size, you know? \n\nNeedless to say, I'm very happy with this place!",1.0,0.9978976249694824

The instructors are always welcoming and energetic. The music puts me in the zone hitting the right BPM for all the different segments. And last, but not least the variation of exercises works muscles I've never felt before.\n\nI highly recommend taking at least 10 classes to get acclimated with the moves and to really start feeling the difference. \n\nLiftToneBurn!",1.0,0.9994202852249146
