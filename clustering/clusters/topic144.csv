The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.\n\nThe second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.\n\nOh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either.",1.0,0.760404109954834

The waiters are very friendly and they explain the menu really well. They also offer great suggestions to first time customers. This was definitely a great first time experience especially for people who have never tried fondue style cooking. I thought that cooking appetizers, main course and dessert on a fondue was a very unique idea. The setting and lighting has a very romantic feel. On the other side, the prices are completely ridiculously high. You do not get a lot of food for the price. Our check was over $120 and that's a ridiculous price to pay for tiny portions of food. I would suggest this to someone who wants a romantic night in town with some experimental fondue styles but I definitely wouldn't go back for that price. For $20 we bought our own fondue pot and tried our own cheese dips, meats and desserts without the crazy expensive price.",1.0,0.794654130935669

While the soft lighting and tiled ceiling lends a lovely ambiance, the food and service did not stand up. \n\nIt was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. \n\nI enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. \n\nI also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's.",0.0,0.9654045701026917

I think I visit at least once a month. It's a family favorite for sure.\n\nWell, my anniversary actually falls on Valentine's Day so when it came to picking a place to have a romantic dinner, we actually wanted to come to Babbo's. So we both dressed up and without even a reservation, took a chance and drove to the restaurant. Surprisingly enough, it was only a 10 minute wait. We sat down and waited a very comfy couch and before I knew it, our name was called. They sat us by the wall where it was very intimate and romantic.\n\nWe were immediately served free bread and water. The bread is just amazing. It's a little addicting so be careful not to stuff yourself before dinner. We decided on an appetizer of toasted ravioli. First time I tried it and I was so happy we ordered it!! I normally order just their spaghetti and meatball but I was feeling adventurous so my server recommended the pasta martini. I almost ordered it just for the name!! The bf ordered a chicken and bbq calzone and he was a happy camper for sure!\n\nWhile waiting for our food, a manager walked up to our table and explained that the pasta line was backed up and that he sincerely apologized for the wait and that he would give us an employee discount. I didn't even realize that 20 minutes went by. Our glasses were constantly refilled and the bread kept coming fresh from the oven. It was a pleasent surprise indeed.\n\nWhat topped it off was the main course itself. The pasta martini was just AMAZING!!! Wasn't too saucy or too light. It was just right! We skipped dessert that evening because we were SO full from bread! They were gracious enough to pack the other half of our dinner that wasn't consummed as well as some extra bread to take home with us! What a team! The service was just wonderful! \n\nThank you Babbo's for making my night!!",1.0,0.9987748265266418

First of all, we keep getting coupons for this place from the circulars, and decided to go ahead and try it since we both love Italian food.  When we walked in, there was a sign that said \""Seat Yourself\"" so we did.  The place wasn't very busy.. with about 1/3 of the 15 or so tables available.  It took around 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, and without even saying hello or introducing herself, she asked what we wanted to order.  I was a waitress for years, and thought it was very strange that she didn't even ask for our drink order.  We said we'd have some wine, and a couple waters first, then order.  Well that was a big mistake because it took her nearly 20 minutes to come back.  At this point, I was still pretty forgiving, since I figured another server must have called out sick or something, or this lady was pissed that she had to work on Valentine's Day.  When she finally returned, she didn't apologize, or explain what took so long.  We both ordered a ravioli dish that was okay, and very small, it was almost like a kid's dish.  We're not big eaters, and even still the food portion was tiny.  I would rate the food 6 out of 10.  I would NOT recommend this place if you value good customer service.  Go to Bamboo Grille next door, much better food, and great customer service.",0.0,0.9936083555221558

We booked through Open Table over a week prior and was given a confirmation, so you would think that it wouldn't take close to 15 minutes for them to find our reservation when we arrived.\n\nWe were then sat in Carlos section. Took awhile for us to be greeted and then My mother in law ordered water with lemon, no lemons were given. But hey no big deal! We all ordered steaks and it comes with a starch and salad. Felt the pricing was good for what's included compared to other steak houses.\n\nSalads arrived, only table not given croutons, but then again, that is not anything to really complain about! Main courses were delivered and waiter said he will stop by in just a few to make sure everything was ok. Well we didn't receive the extra side dishes we ordered, steaks were under seasoned, and over cooked. The waiter, nor anyone else checked by or was in the vicinity to let them know. So we just ate our mediocre food, the waiter finally came by as we were finished to ask if we wanted a box. Also refills on drinks... Forget about it!!\n\nGetting a box was another 10 minute wait, and then getting the check was about another 10 minutes. Of course the check also reflected all the food we never received. The bill was corrected though and we then left.\n\nBeing that I have been in the service industry for many years, I can honestly say that I can tolerate a lot of errors or oversight by wait staff or kitchen as places can get busy. Not one aspect of this dinner was acceptable and the server didn't even seem that busy with other tables. \n\nReally sad about this as the restaurant has great potential.",0.0,0.9988812804222108

Because this was our first visit, Pam, our exceptional waitress, comped us the parmesan bread and it is delicious...next time we visit, I will gladly pay for the scrumptious bread.  The menu is vairied, lots of beef and ribs, seafood and more.  I won't go into what we ate because I humbly believe that whatever you order will be delicious and plentiful.  The atmosphere is a little noisy but that's OK, the vibe makes for the dining experience.  You could go crazy looking at all the sports memorabelia, if you are sports fan, any sport, you will find something to ooh and ahh over.  I have to repeat, Pam our waitress was terrific.  They were unusually busy that night because of a large take-out order that came as a surprise to the restaurant and the wait for our main dish was a little long.  Pam made sure we were informed that all was in order and to be candid, it was nice having a little time between our salads and the main dish.  I understand that a diner or two could have a less than perfect visit to any restaurant but I don't understand how anyone could rate Don and Charlie's anything less than 5 stars.

The hostess was nice and the view was very pretty, but other than that, our experience was not good at all. The menu was a set menu and so our table decided to order something a little different so we could try the selections. Unfortunately we were not happy. I have had better braised beef short ribs at chain restaurant's and the flavors did not go well together. Each person at our table expressed their disappointment in the service we received as well as the food we were served. The presentation was even a bit sloppy. One gentleman in my party was so disappointed with the Veal that he asked to return it to the kitchen because it was not good at all. \n\nWe felt the service was poor. Our server lacked personality and was slow and didn't show much interest because the menu was set and he knew he was going to receive a gratuity based on $105 per person. The drinks we ordered would be finished and we would have to wait and flag someone down to ask him to order another drink. \n\nFinally it was dessert time, and we each ordered one of each. I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake which was awful. I couldn't even swallow it the flavor was so bad. My boyfriend ordered the Champagne Sabayon and the champagne flavor was so overwhelming it was like taking a shot of alcohol for dessert. Our other guest ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Torte which I took one bite of and it was so rich. Nothing was easy to eat and good on the pallet. \n\nWe felt this review was very important to write because the next day, my boyfriend and I went to Sedona for the rest of the weekend and had a wonderful dinner outside with amazing views of the mountains and stars with the moon rising. The food as excellent and service was great. The price was more than half less and our experience was so much better.

I have lived in the valley for years and always wanted to dine at Elements. Normally on special occasions or when we are in the mood to treat ourselves we have our usual spots; Mastros, Flemings, Donovans... If you couldn't tell we enjoy a nice steak, but this year we decided to mix it up and give Elements a shot and were very excited to finally check this place out. \n\nThe view did not disappoint. Megan, one of the managers was very pleasant when accommodating our reservation. Another one of the managers was also very pleasant who sat us, but I do not recall his name... Unfortunately, that is where the pleasantries stopped.\n\nOur server came across rude and uninterested. This could have been because of the prix fixe menu or maybe he was just having an off night but our drinks were always left empty, we rarely saw him, he came across very snarky and even sarcastic at times. \n\nI was also unimpressed with the food/menu for the evening.

As a business owner I understand you can't be perfect 100% of the time but this was a definite disappointment and I felt my experience warranted the lowest possible rating.

I emailed to make reservations the weekend before (which I thought might be a little late) - and breathed a sigh of relief when I got an email back saying we were in!  \n\nWe arrived at about 10 minutes prior to our reservation time and there was already a line out the door.  The hostess station was set up so that the hostesses were facing INTO the restaurant, not out to the arriving patrons - which was kind of a pain.  We had to push past all the people that were waiting for tables and enter the restaurant in order to let them know we were there.  There were at least 3 hostesses working the station - and we checked in with two of them. They said it would be a few minutes. We waited, saw a large party that had arrived before us get seated - good!  Everything is moving along!  We just had to wait for three more couples to be seated and we'd be in!  Then a party of two that were a walk-in got seated.  We checked in again at the hostess station to make sure they hadn't forgotten us.  When the hostesses made like they were going to seat another party that had arrived after us - another couple that had been waiting as well stepped in and got pretty testy with them. That couple were immediately seated. A half-hour after our reservation time, we checked in for a third time and were finally granted a table.\n\nThe restaurant was obviously way over-booked - and the wait staff were apologizing left and right for that (even though it wasn't their fault). They alone saved this review from being a one star. We ordered off of the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu and ordered a bottle of really inexpensive but wonderful sparkling wine. The Roasted beet salad was terrific, the grilled salmon solidly done and the berry shortcake for dessert was good too. I'd be willing to give Spiedini another try on a less busy holiday based on the quality of the food alone. The courses came out of the kitchen S.L.O.W.L.Y - which I wouldn't have minded so much if I hadn't planned on getting up at 5:30 the next morning for a trip out of town. \n\nTwo and a half hours after our reservation time, we got up to pay the bill. I was looking forward to raving about this experience - but the anarchic hostess station, the over-booked status of the restaurant and the overwhelmed kitchen unfortunately put a damper on the the whole meal.  Kudos to the wait staff for being so nice and professional under pressure - we tipped them well because we felt so bad for them.",1.0,0.9376423358917236

After she dropped off our food we didnt see her again for another 25 minutes so no refilled water glass throughout the whole time we were there. \n\nThe Steak I ordered was pretty good with only a little bit of grisle so I was pretty happy with that. So now that I finally got a good steak in my tummy I wanted some dessert to follow it up with so I ordered something I thought would be quick which was the shake. 35 minutes later I flagged down our waitress who was at the bar talking to other servers for the last 15 minutes and I asked if she could just put it in a to go cup. From the time we got there till the time we left it was almost 3 hours. \n\nThe place only gets the first star from me because the steak was actually good.

Oh, I cannot tell you how disappointing this meal was. First of all, I figured on a $300-400 meal-it was almost $700. And the meal was just not good. 2 out of my 3 courses were pretty bad. We actually heard other diners saying the same thing. I ordered butter-poached lobster that was tough and bland. My husband ordered the seafood linguine appetizer that he said was \""OK.\"" For my entree, I had the veal loin which WAS good. My husband had the short ribs which he, again, said were \""OK.\"" I finished with a carrot cake with sauteed apples which I didn't even EAT. My husband had the caramel chocolate bomb, which HE didn't even eat--I ate that while he enjoyed the two scoops of ice cream he requested along with the cake. Several of the amuse bouche were very tasty, but for that much money, I really expected a pretty mind-blowing dinner...and it wasn't even good.

The image I gleaned from their website made it appear to be all plush pillows, flickering candles, and meditating statuettes. \nThe internet can be so deceiving. \nFirst of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is (and I quote), \""designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi\"" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V-Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V-Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley (Gandhi's and Gaylord's), in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian/Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, \""hipster hangout.\"" Next please.",0.0,0.9992386102676392

He also ordered a twice-baked potato with it that was just cheesy deliciousness. \n\nI ordered the ahi, because it seemed to be one of the more creatively prepared meals on the menu, & their ahi is wild...so I could eat it with a clear conscious (see below).

When we sat down, we also noticed that the people dining around us all looked like they had real parts (unlike many Scottsdale restaurants) and seemed to be having just as great of a time as we were. \n\nOur table was fantastic-nestled in the back corner with a perfect view of the back yard complete with fire places. Our meal was unreal. The Valentine menu included 4 courses all of which were decedent. We went with the wine pairing for each course and couldn't have made a better choice. I had an unbelievable salad with blood oranges and pistachio nuts dressed with a light vinaigrette. The combination of flavors and textures was so well thought, I could have had another serving and been happy forever. For my entree I enjoyed scallops served with pearl onions served over risotto. Once again the flavors were surreal. Our dessert was adorable and served on a large wooden block.

Well, we finally got seated after about an hour wait and decided to try a four course selection that was about $30 bucks per person.  One of the courses was a salad, which neither of us are very big fans of at all.  We asked our waiter if we could substitute chips and salsa ($5 bucks value) for a salad that we wouldn't even eat ($10 buck value).  The waiter just shook his head and gave some lame excuse about the computer not being able to do a switch and that we would have to get a salad, even if we weren't going to eat it.  We were disappointed that they could not even compromise at all and told the waiter to not even bring out our salads since we weren't going to eat them.  \n\nWell, besides that small let down, the rest of the meal was very good. For our appetizer we got AZ egg rolls, which were really melt in your mouth good, served with some delicious dipping sauce.  For the main dish, we got the pork tenderloin and center cut steak with Parmesan cheese melted on top, which came with fries that were very tasty.  Our dessert was a really rich white chocolate brownie served with ice cream and chocolate sauce and real flakes of white chocolate on top.  It was so rich that between the two of us, we probably had 5 bites.  \n\nSo all in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night, the prices are reasonable, the service is good (even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu), and the food is very tasty. 3.75/5.",1.0,0.994814932346344

Menu was special for valentines day and had several options.  I chose tilapia and my girlfriend got the filet.  Being a wine couple but not familiar with many wines from outside the U.S. I asked for a rec from the server who admitted to having no idea on wine pairing and left to go ask someone.  Even at biaggis their servers are trained in that.  Very disappointing at a higher dollar establishment.  Remainder of meal not impressive.  Tilapia was average and would agree with some of the other posts in that it was too much food and not enough contrast in flavors.  I forgot to mention the coconut shrimp app we got that was also disappointing.  No coconut flavor at all.  Too full for dessert.  Filet that I tried nothing special either.  For my money- Radio Maria, Milos when it was in Lincoln Square(haven't tried new location), even Jim Goulds.

We were excited to try some good Italian food and wine for our special occasion.  We booked our table for early in the evening so we could take our daughter with us.  She was the only child in the restaurant, but that was ok with her.  She was very well behaved and patient throughout the entire meal.\n\nWe ordered a mixed green salad to start and it was simple and delicious.  I noticed they had polenta as a side dish with one of the courses, so I asked for some. Without hesitation, the server informed me that the chef would not serve a side.  When we asked for plain pasta, we were again informed that the chef would not serve it that way.\n\nNote:  The server never asked the chef ... he just let us know that there would not be any accommodations or special orders.\n\nSo I ordered the beef cheek ravioli with truffle sauce.  \n\nMy meal was the the color of poo when they put it in front of me.  The ravioli turned the color of the sauce and it did not look good. I was not impressed and I was not inclined to eat much of it once I tasted it. Yuck. \n\nMy husband and my daughter had the goat cheese ravioli and that was much better.  I was wishing I had that instead.  But the waiter never came back to check on us and eventually someone came to clear the plates away.  Bye Bye crap. No one even noticed that I did not eat any of it ... they just took it away without a second thought.\n\nWhen the waiter did finally come back, we asked for the check. We asked if we could charge it to our room, and the waiter said that it would take 10 minutes to get the manager to approve it.  We pulled out a credit card instead of waiting since we were looking forward to getting out of there.  Just like other Yelpers said, it was disappointing, expensive and pretentious.

A small bar space but intimate I guess. Greeted promptly by our bartender and bar-back with smiles and served my wine with a small recommendation based on what I like.  A good start so far.\n\nHaving just got done from teaching yoga my date wanted simple. \""Cheese flat bread please, to start\"" i asked the bartender, Once finished consuming our starting plate i was neither impressed or disappointed. I mean who can really mess up a cheese pizza?? I do appreciate lots of basil and garlic though if the pizza is to be without any other special toppings. Anyways, still enjoyed it very much.\n\nWe ordered than the pot roast for our shared entree. I thoroughly enjoyed it but found the meat a bit cold on the bottom???? nothing worth sending it back since the rest of the plate was delicious but how was it any bit cool when it arrived so quickly? sort of a mystery to me.\n\nOverall our dinner was short and we had a good experience. I would only say that a almost $20 plate should come out steaming hot. That is all. Service was top notch and I will definitely be back sooner than later :).\n\nBTW their baker comes in after hours to make all of their bread. that is amazing and good luck finding that in most any other establishment.",1.0,0.8400095701217651

I love that OT is finally a respected reservation system at almost every fine-dining restaurant now. I've been an OT member since 2006 and believe me, it wasn't always this easy. Gone are the days of sifting through their restaurant lists realizing the place you want is not available and you'll have to call only to be placed on hold for an obscene amount of time, and you decide to leave a message only to never receive a call back confirming your request. Yay for self-service technology! Moving on...\n\nAs many of you know, Mr. Burke has an obsession with eggs. I didn't see it in the dinner menu, but more so in the d\u00e9cor. Think obscure paintings and sculptures of Humpty Dumpty-like dudes everywhere. I'm not into eggs, but these were kinda cute, so I didn't mind. What I did mind were the two tops--seating was too close for comfort. We could hear the conversations next to us, which was more of a distraction than we wanted on our special night.\n\nAnother thing that irked me was immediately after taking our orders, our waitress declared, \""Just so you know, we're REALLY busy tonight, so there will be a longer wait than usual.\"" \n\nMy boyfriend and I had different reactions to the comment: He appreciated the head's up, while I didn't understand why she needed to tell us right then and there. You're a celebrity chef restaurant in a popular Vegas hotel--of course you're busy! I don't care if the kitchen is on fire; always make your guests feel at ease. \n\nNevertheless, their Blueberry Thrill martini was surprisingly refreshing and their homemade dinner roll was mouth-watering. The roll comes in individual pans that arrive straight from the oven and on to your plate. For our main courses, I ordered the Seared Salmon and he ordered the Dry-Aged Bone-In New York Strip. Both entrees delivered exactly what we expected--appetizing, generously portioned, and seasoned well. No wow-factor, though. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were amazing. If I can recommend only one thing on their menu, make sure you order the truffle fries!!

It was almost as fun picking out all the chocolate we wanted as it was eating it all. Wait...I take that back. It was more fun eating it ;) The chocolate, sadly, did not last long. We made quick work of those tasty morsels seeking refuge in their heart-shaped home. Poor lil' guys didn't stand a chance.\n\nEthel M's also has an enchanting little cactus garden. I'm a sucker for a good cactus garden. They even had Valentine's decorations among the cacti, which was cheesy and super cute :) Included in the Valentine's Day festivities was the helpless gazebo, which made a nice place to sit and eat our chocolate. I left Ethel M's a happy, chocolate-filled camper.",0.0,0.962406575679779

I made reservations a week before at the Sahara location, and called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, there were 4 other couples in the doorway waiting. We stood there for 10 minutes before someone came to the front. BTW, there is no podium or reception area at the front either) Did they greet us? NO. They took one couple to be seated. At that point, another young couple that was waiting, said to us, \""That's the 2nd couple that's been seated since we arrived half hour ago, and we were here before they were. We're appaled and would rather go elsewhere. Good luck to you.\"" We began to wonder if we should stay. We figured we would wait a while longer. After all, it was Valentines Day, where else are we going to get seated at the last minute?\nAbout 15 minutes went by, and no one came to greet us, and there were 2 empty tables. I walked across the room near the kitchen entrance and told one of the employees we had been waiting over 20 minutes, and no one has even aknowledged our presence, and that we had a reservation. Their response was, \"" sorry, it's Valentines Day and we're short staffed.\"" I informed them that was not my problem, and at the very least someone could at least greet us & inform us that they're running behind. Again, the response was, \""Sorry, we're too busy.\"" At that point we left as the other couple behind us did the same.\n\nA week later, we decided to return for my birthday(after all, we had a free gift certificate to use). If I had trusted my instincts the first time, I would've left the certificate on Valentines Day for someone else to use.\nAfter we again waited 10 minutes before someone aknowledged we were even there, we were seated., We were brought a wine list and asked for our drink order. We stated we would have water while we looked over the wine list. The server brought out tapwater with no ice, and a basket of very dry bread. Again, I started to question myself. (Should I go somewhere else?)\nThe salad was served on a warm plate with very runny dressing. My wife asked for her dressing on the side, and of course her salad was drenched instead.\nFor the main meal, my wife had an undercooked piece of fish, and I had overcooked gnocci.\nThis was by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I made sure they were aware of that when I informed them they were not getting a tip. I would stay away from this place. The staff is rude, and they clearly do not care about the customer whatsoever. I'm glad I had a gift certificate, because I most certainly would not have paid for this experience.",0.0,0.9993939399719238

We checked open table, saw that Z'Tejas still had some openings, and since we had been told by some friends that their food was excellent we decided to make a reservation.\n\nPositives: the food really was great! We loved the chips & salsa appetizer we chose (even though I do find it a little silly that you have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant), loved the complimentary hot cornbread in a skillet, and loved our entrees as well (I got the fajitas, he got the chicken enchiladas). The food was almost better than great, it was exactly what we would have wanted and I find myself already craving it again!\n\nNegatives: It took us fifteen solid minutes to even get a waitress to our table, which I would totally understand if it was super busy, but it wasn't. We were actually surprised at how many open tables we saw given that it was Valentine's Day, and yet we still had to wait. Our waitress was also just not that great once she arrived. She didn't seem to know much about the food or drinks, and seemed a bit flighty.We were also disappointed by the drinks we received. My fiance ordered a Dos Equis draft and they apparently had run out earlier in the evening, so he went with a bottled Dos Equis amber. Not a huge deal, again, I understand completely that things happen, but it was slightly disappointing. I ordered the \""beerita\"", which is a margarita with a mini Corona bottle in it. It was okay, but I have absolutely had better. It was supposed to be frozen and it was more melty than anything, which I personally don't think tastes as great with the beer pouring into it.\n\nOverall, I am certain we will be going back, but maybe for a lunch experience with beers rather than a dinner experience with specialty drinks.",0.0,0.990215539932251

Well, that was easy enough; a phone call and a nice gentleman got us down for 8pm sharp. We arrived to find a mostly empty, should have known for a Monday, Eddie's House. The place is looks and feels great. We were shown to our two person table which was large without being too expansive and had some really comfortable plush chairs.\n\nOur server was a young guy by the name of Chris, he came and asked us water preference (nice touch) and then returned to take our drink orders. We each had a glass of wine, for the lady a Cab Sav by the name of Dynamite and for myself a Pinot Noir going by Row 11. Both were good and the pour was generous from the bartender. \n\nWhile munching our complimentary bread basket with tasty butter side (so good), we decided to try the Tuna Tar Tar Nachos. When they arrived I was underwhelmed to say the least. There was basically 2 ounces of chopped tuna with about the same amount of avocado and very little else. The chips were very good but I expect (especially for $12) that there be enough to go around for the chips provided, simply put, there was not by a long shot.\n\nUndeterred we ordered our entrees. The Filet and Roasted Salmon were both extremely good. The portions were about what I expected and given that we had bread, wine, tuna tar tar already there wasn't any doubt I would be full. The salmon was cooked wonderfully and fell apart upon prodding with my fork. The filet was cooked a tad bit rare but still was within the range of medium-rare, I tried two bites of it and almost wished I had ordered it instead (it had been awhile since I'd had good filet). We both finished our orders and agreed we wouldn't be able to get a desert. Chris came by and ensured we were ready and got everything out of the way and our check with casual speediness. He was really great the entire meal.\n\nSummed up; good wine, underwhelming appetizer, great entrees, excellent service.

I had my Husband make a reservation for Valentine's Day, as I figured it would be a nice place to have dinner that night. \n\nI can see why a lot of people like this place, but for me there was just too much mediocre things to make it a must go. First of all, the waitress was VERY nice, but the restaurant was very busy, given it was Valentine's Day, that the service was very slow. It took a long time to place our drink order and then longer to place our dinner order. I did like the atmosphere and enjoyed the fact we could sit outside in February. We sat near the fireplace, which was a nice treat. \n\nNow, back to the food... the wine was very good and bread before the meal was nice. We ordered the baby fries, which we hot and crispy (extra crispy). We liked the malt vinegar and aoli the best for dipping. I ordered the catfish, which I found to be bland. It came with sweet potato puree, which needed more flavor as well (maybe some spice on the pecans) as well as hush puppies, which were the BEST part... oh so good! My Husband had the corned beef, which was very tender and good, but he hardly ate the other things it came with, so not really worth the price. We had the donuts for dessert, which were good, but overwhelming with how many you got. It would have been better with only donut holes. \n\nFor the price we paid (close to $100), I thought the food wasn't worth it.

The flow of the meal was timed nicely. \n\nFood & Service 5/5:\nI loved the warm bread they served here, this and a touch of butter made this awesome. For apps we ordered the tuna, escargot, and calamari. I really enjoyed the tuna and the escargot. Tuna was flavoured nicely and cooked perfectly with a light sear. The cheese on the snails was amazing and had that great gooy texture of melted cheese. This paired really nicely with the warm bread. The calamari was ok, I've had better at other restaurants. I think that the batter was ok, but the calarmi itself a bit underdone. Ironically enough we didn't end up getting steak here. Instead I opted for the lamb shank. This was cooked perfectly until it was almost falling off the bone. The meat was tender and flavourful. It didn't have the strong lamb taste - that you can sometimes get when ordering lamb. The rosemary sauce on the lamb was delicious. I enjoyed the green beans, which were crunchy and give the dish a nice textural element. I also enjoyed the fries, which are the thin type and they weren't too oily and had nice crunch. My boyfriend ordered the lobster with scallops and asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly. There was this amazing lobster sauce that accompanied his dish that was creamy and had a really nice subtle lobster taste to it. After all of this we decided that there was enough room to get dessert. We ordered the molten lava cake with vanilla ice-cream. This was baked perfectly with the soft centre in the middle. \n\nFor the entire meal with apps, main, dessert with tax and tip it came up to about $100. This is a great place to bring that special someone, or to celebrate an event. For wine lovers, you can bring your own wine and they don't charge a corkage fee.\n\nDecor: 4/5\nThe restaurant is fairly big and the dark wood, white table clothes, and black chalk board signs, give the place a clean yet elegant feel. It's a great spot for both a romantic dinner or if you want to celebrate something special.\n\nI'll be back again the next time I'm in Montreal.",1.0,0.999534010887146

It's one of her favorite restaurants, in no small part because steak is one of her favorite things.\n\nAfter my last Valentine's day experience at Bella Luna, I have lowered my expectations for Valentine's day service. But why can't we just go to the Four Seasons every year? I digress.\n\nSo we made our reservation three or four weeks in advance and arrived a few minutes early. It took 10 - 15 minutes to be seated, which gave us time to walk around outside and take some self portraits in our dressy clothes.\n\nThey seated us in an awkward two-person table that is nestled in the corner of one of their half-walls.\n\nOkay, time-out. If your restaurant has fewer than 5% of your tables in the tiny, two-person variety, then you shouldn't have them at all. Stop screwing us over! The table wasn't even large enough to lay a single closed menu on. Look, if you're one of those tiny French restaurants with only fuck-you tables, then fine. I'll chalk it up to French peculiarities. But when we are the only couple at a restaurant in a two person table, well, I start dropping stars and f-bombs.\n\nOkay, so our server was pleasant, but the food and service came slow. At the end of the meal he gave us his business card and asked us to visit again. We also received a a $25 gift card for eating over V-day weekend, and received a thank-you e-mail the next day that I found to be a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe food was good, although I wish they had the V-day blue-cheese crusted fillet Mignon all the time, and not just on one day a year.

When our server finally decided to come and take our drink order, we had had enough time to know our complete order, drinks, apps, and entrees. When 7:15 rolled around we still did not have our entrees, someone came by and told us that one of our stakes was overdone, had to be re-fired and that it would be about 5-7 minutes longer. At 7:45 we FINALLY received our food, my boyfriends burger was much too rare and sent it back (at that time we realized the server never asked how he would like it cooked). Since we had reservations elsewhere at 8:00 we threw all of our food into to-go boxes at an attempt to make it. \n\nWe talked to a manager (who happened to be the person who told us that it would be 5-7 minutes longer PSH!) he took 50% off our bill, leaving our total bill for 4 people at $150! To top it all off, in our rush to make our next reservation WE FORGOT OUR FOOD WE DIDN'T GET TO EAT ON THE TABLE! \n\nI am so unbelievably upset that we choose to spend an extremely special night here and ended up, hungry, pissed off, AND missed our next reservation.

We were told there was none, so with no other choice we just went with it. We ended up paying an extra $30 for an okay glass of champagne, standard cup of coffee, and a total joke of a brownie ice cream dessert, all the ingredients of which tasted as if they had come out of a box and/or store-bought mix. Total for the night was close to $90 per person, after the $30 fee for the mandatory package, which they totally skimped on, knowing that a lot of people would be coerced into getting it. Not cool.\n\nEverything else was pretty good. The meat was good, nothing amazing. I wasn't very impressed by the meats I looked forward to trying, such as the filet mignon, but my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. The buffet bar was wonderful though, with lots of gourmet options. The parmesan breads were hands down AMAZING and totally ADDICTIVE.\n\nOverall, a very mixed experience because Chima clearly knew it was misleading a bunch of people into paying an extra $30 on Valentine's Day. They were not upfront about it at all, and the price was never posted on their website, FB page, etc before we came. Basically, we got there and were told we would be getting it, no other options available.

All of it was dry and so salty that we were reaching for our water glasses constantly.  The service was what was really odd.  The skewer guys would show up in our section in such a rush that they missed our table (and others) most of the time.  You have to wave them down or ask passing busboys to get service.  By the time the pork ribs and rib eye came around (after my husband spoke to our server about the lack of service) all of the sides were cold and we were just over it and full from the massive amount of water we had to drink.\n\nWe are not tough to please people.

You're most modest it would seem.\n\nOr is it that once you see past the grey, nonchalent exterior you find the most opulent, vibrant, welcoming and warm interiors, with some of the most gorgeous views over Edinburgh Castle?\n\nOr is it because you are always new, never bored and staid and same-old. Your menu changes every time I am here. Always a surprise, a new twist and turn; something to thrill and delight. Like that pork cheek I had last night, and the baked figs with amaretti for sweet seconds. You popped my pork cheek cherry and I liked it.\n\nOr is it most of all, because it's the little things that count, that your bathrooms are scented with a heady incense? I do like a good perfume.\n\nThat naked chick on the outside with the big bajongas isn't half bad either. But that's just being superficial.\n\nYou have not once let me down. Whether it's been for a mid-week lunch, a weekend date, a Sunday night family dinner; you always deliver. A reliable lover but one that always surprises, say you'll be mine? \n\nAlways and forever,\n\nJenny L",1.0,0.9984721541404724

We just usually don't do dinner out on V-Day.  Not that we have anything against the big day, but my idea of a romantic dinner out does not involve 50 other couples having their special dinner at the same time.  Anywho, fondue was the plan, but I neglected to buy anything to dip into the imaginary cheese I also failed to buy.\n\nWe settled on Tandoori as neither of us had been there, just down the street from home, and we didn't expect it to be a major Valentine's destination.  I was pleasantly surprised they were offering a complimentary rose for the ladies.  Complimentary, as in free.  No dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they are damned if they do (like a $5 rose is going to make up for screwing up the flower thing) and damned if they don't (he's so cheap, he couldn't even buy me a stinkin' $5 rose).  Nice touch, no pressure, woman happy, all is well.\n\nWe started with the bread basket which had to be a concoction of Robert Atkins' evil twin.  It had four kinds of Naan (plain, onion, garlic, and potato).  We ate all we could and then some and still had leftovers.  I had the chicken makhani which is a tomato based curry with herbs and spices.    Perhaps a little too spicy if you can't tolerate any heat, but for me it was perfect.  My husband had the lamb vindaloo.  I tried it and it was a little too hot for me, but it was pretty damn good I must say.\n\nWe found our server to be pleasant and attentive.  I'm sorry we didn't go sooner (actually we tried, but they close between lunch and dinner) as they are moving their Scottsdale location to Hayden & Via de Ventura.  Somehow I think we'll make the extra effort to go again.  But I will attempt to avoid the belly dancing-I've got more than enough belly of my own.",1.0,0.9019464254379272

But it being Valentine's day, you'd think they would up their ante right?\n\nLets just say, the chocolate covered strawberries were AMAZING!! I am not a chocolate fan at all, but the sweet and juiciness of the strawberry against the chocolate was delish! For an appetizer, we had the caesar salad, which was a good proportion and started off good, but then at the bottom of the bowl, I began to get a lot of stems(hard part) which were very nasty, so I stopped eating it.\n\nI then chose the chicken flatbread, which was GREAT! I loved every bite of it. And for desert, we had the chocolate fondue, and that was a let down in itself. I wanted to go for the cheese one, but my boyfriend loves chocolate so we went with that. The only good thing I can say about that was the strawberries(which we didn't have a lot, so our waiter was nice enough to bring out more!) My boyfriend tried the brownies, rice krispies and dipped them in the chocolate(he thought they were ok, nothing special). I tried the marshmallows and heated them under the little fire, and they were tasty.\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere was very relaxed and romantic, there were couples all around, and they even had a free photobooth outside to take complementary pictures! That was very fun! The workers seemed to be pretty nice, and our waiter really helped us out a lot. Would I go back again? Sure. Just to try the hookah and have some drinks and more strawberries! But I'm going to steer away from the chocolate next time.\n\nOh yea, they provide free parking as well, but since I literally live 2 mins walking distance, and it was a nice day out, me and my boyfriend chose to walk.",1.0,0.9440069198608398

For dessert the tiramisu and a french press of Lux coffee.\n\nAll of that between 3 people and our bill only came out to $66. Which surprised us (we thought it would be more).

I called ahead and they were taking reservations for Valentines Day.  When we arrived the hostess asked us to take a seat in the lounge and they would let us know when our table was ready.  I ordered a drink from the bar and and an Iced Tea for my wife.  When I asked the Bartender for a straw I was informed that they do not provide straws as they endanger animals.  I thought that it was odd but ignored it.  20 Minutes later our table was ready.  Our table was right in front of the tank.  I thought the tank would be bigger than it was and I was a little disappointed at the fish in the tank.  There was a few sharks but they were all pretty small.  When I had made reservations I was told they would have a special Valentines Day menu.  Our waiter did not offer this menu to us at all.  We ordered the Duck Tacos for our Appetizer.  They took a while to arrive.  They were decent but not spectacular.  The decor was nice but my wife and my self both agreed that they were trying to make it a fancy restaurant but failed on many levels.  1.  The table cloth was not cloth but vinyl.  2nd the napkins were actually paper napkins folded to give the illusion of cloth.  Our waiter helped us choose our meal and was very honest about what was good and what was not.  When the food arrived it looked good.  I had the mahi mahi and felt that it was a little bland.   Over all I was disappointed with our experience and felt I had to apologize to my wife for a mediocre meal.  She felt it was a nice restaurant that just needed a few things to make it better.  She made the point that they do not provide straws because it endangers animals yet they serve seafood in front of fish?,0.0,0.9966589212417604

Picture a 2 year old drinking milk out of those large plastic Coke cups and the prospects are dismal. It was apparent there was a language barrier but common sense should overcome the barrier and dictate that the toddler needs a special chair and special cup.

We went on Valentine's Day but it wasn't that busy around 6p. Started with the Mundo salad, it was shredded with lots of good things like veggies, nuts, and I think some dried fruit. We liked it very much. The queso app that everyone recommends was good, but not great, and I am not sure a bowl of melted cheese is worth $15. The hubby loved his carnitas and my chile rellano stuffed with filet mignon was very flavorful, however, my dish had a severe protein shortage. I took a bite when it arrived and it had a piece of filet in it, I tried to share a bite with my hubby and had to destroy the entire chile searching for a piece of meat. Kind of ruined the dish since I did not want to disembowel my chile to locate the additional pieces of meat (and there were only 2 more cubes of filet in it!) Maybe the kitchen messed up? I don't think there was more than 2 oz of meat in my entree. Also, we ordered a nice bottle of wine. After we had finished, I remembered I had a Yelp check in offer for a free glass of wine. I showed the waiter and he said he would bring me a glass of the wine we had been drinking. Then I heard the manager tell him to give me house wine, which he did, but he tried to say it was the other wine. Silly to lie to me if I am about to taste it and find out!

It was overly spiced, so much that I barely enjoyed it. This was my only complaint the whole evening. \n\n2. Appetizers: Boy chose the \""bacon and eggs\"", which was actually pork medallions with an egg served with spinach and hollandaise.  I had the cheese souffle with winter salad. Both were delicious. The salad was composed of fruits (apples and pears sliced very thin) and greens topped with balsamic dressing.\n\n3. Entr\u00e9es: Steak with mushroom/cheese strudel for me, and chicken \""two ways\"" for him. My steak was cooked perfectly. Boy (one of the pickiest eaters on the planet) raved about his barley risotto. He claims that it was one of the best things he has ever eaten. So if anyone has a recipe, fork it over. \n\n4. Dessert: We both had the chocolate spoon bar. Yummy. \n\nI see other reviewers have amply commented about the side dishes, so I won't say too much except that the cream cheese/chive biscuits are super-addicting. \n\nOverall, a fantastic evening.

So the starter's came soup quite nice but under seasoned and the ravioli was far from being al dente the only flavoursome part of it was the sage butter sauce.

(Thankfully, since I wouldn't have made it to see feb 15th if he cooked for us,lol).\n\nTo start, it may seem like a long wait but I was really impressed we only had to wait an hour and twenty minutes to get out food delivered. We're a good 4.5 miles away and I'm sure they were really busy, so points to them for that, and points for a really friendly delivery man! \n\nFood wise, it did arrive cold which wasn't great because one of the dishes was chicken Parm and the cheese was no longer bubbly and soft. As much as I have to take a point off for this, I really don't hold it against them. Since it was valentines day, I do imagine it must have sat  there ready for a bit before someone was actually able to get it out to us. I'm ok with it for that reason. We popped it in the oven and for the most part brought it back to life. \n\nOnce it was ready despite the fact that my chicken Parm wasn't up to it's potential, the food was pretty tasty, especially their sauce which had a mild kick and a nice bold flavor. In Italian cooking, the sauce can really make or break the dish, and their's definitely elevated these dishes. I honestly wish their was more,  but that's my only complaint there.\n\nOverall, I feel that Giada's has potential to be 5 stars in my book, but I'll have to reserve that until next time I order. If the food comes hot and bubbly next time, I'll gladly update the review, but for now, it's worth it to try.

I had the salmon,  my date the beef. \n\nAfter 35 minutes we finally got our food.   We were literally there for an hour before finally eating.

I went up there to ask how much longer the same time. The hostess( blonde hair, young, and had a nose piercing) was not even acknowledging the people walking up. They had to talk to her. The little boy finally got her attention and ask how much longer. She holds up the two sheets full of names and says this is how many people are waiting. The little boy walks away and tells his family. Mom was furious and speaks to the manager. The hostess heard everything and wasn't too happy. Everyone of her co workers that walked up she told what had happened and even pointed at the lady who complained!\nI just found it to be very unprofessional and rude. My friend and I both work in a restaurant and there is no way that would have been allowed. I understand it's crazy busy, but that girls behavior was ridiculous. When she called our name, she tells us wow you guys get a booth. That's what you get for being patient. I don't know what she meant by that. \n\nNext off the food. Anything fried there is pretty good. I don't eat unhealthy but I figure it valentines day, so wth. My friend and I shared the sampler! It was pretty good. I asked for a Caesar salad sub balsamic dressing on the side. I reminded him twice and it still came out wrong. Our waiter (an older gentleman) knew too but chose not to say anything and I didn't want to complain.  So I ate it.

The crust was delicious and had an amazing bite! It also held up really well (a little too well for the plastic forks, lol). The light and fluffy whipped cream was heavenly. There were also little pockets of raspberry and lemon in the cream that made it just perfectly tart. The fresh raspberries on top were perfect and nothing was overly sweet. Dessert perfection!\n\nYes, you can really spend a whole paragraph talking about a single dessert. Serious kudos. Anyway, I raved about it to lovely owner/master baker, Tiffany, and learned that it was the Raspberry Lemon Tart's first day in the case!

We killed that one quick, I could just eat wood chips soaked in that ponzu chile sauce.  We also had the fried rice, skirt steak salad and roasted garlic shrimp.  Everything was great! Will definitely come back to try other menu items, or just for drinks, edamame and to read their hashtags.  Hope they bring other things and hashtags to the menu!  *playlist that night was great, lots of 90s jams mixed with some Justin Timberlake...

Come to find out, they had overbooked their reservations and were running AT LEAST one hour behind on seating people. I, along with many other people there, was pretty pissed off. I mean, what is the point of making reservations, ESPECIALLY on a busy night like Valentine's day, if you still have to wait an hour. I felt especially bad for people who had tickets to shows later in the evening who were trying to decided whether they could wait that long to eat dinner and still make it to the show. And to add insult to injury, the first employee we came in contact with after waiting 15 minutes out in the cold just to get in the door, was oblivious and just asking how long the line was and shocked to hear it was out to the taxi drop off area. They should have sent someone out to inform people of what was going on and apologize. \n\nSo we check in with the hostess, and then head over to the bar, clearly some vodka was in order to check my rage. The bar was packed with other disgruntled would-be diners. About an hour to an hour and a half after arriving, we were finally taken back to a table.

First of all, we were seated promptly and immediately were told about the special, prix fix, and recommendations. Since it was Valentines Day, the service was a bit slow, but my date and I didn't mind since we had a 9:30 show at La Reve.\n\nWe started with a glass of borduex recommended by our sommelier.  The price was reasonable and the taste was suttle and not overpowering to the palatte.  For our entr\u00e9e, I had the duo of beef with black truffle/celery pur\u00e9e and my girlfriend had the steak frites with onion compote.  First of all the duo of beef was amazing.  The meat was just melting in my mouth and the celery pur\u00e9e along with the black truffle just made the dish blossom.  Although the portion was small, I recommend getting a starter or salad.  My girlfriend's dish was also delicious. The onion compote brought a different flare to the steak, and unlike some places it was cooked to perfection.\n\nAfter our dinner, we got dessert.  The apple crisp tart served with cinnemon icecream.  It was good but nothing too fancy.  I would have expected more, but sine it was valentines day, we also recieved a variety of desserts along with what we ordered.\n\nThe only thing I could really complain about was the random loud music playing ever so often due to the waterfall show right outside he restaurant.  Other than that, I would definitely go back, but not on a regular basis.",1.0,0.965386927127838

I was a little disappointed that they did not accept it, but I wouldn't have minded at all if we had a good experience. \nNeedless to say, the service was extremely poor and the food was horrible. I ordered a seafood pasta dish and I've never tasted nastier seafood in all my life. The shrimp tasted old and the other seafood was extremely \""fishy\"". I couldn't believe what I was tasting so kept trying to gulp it down, but about a quarter of the way through I just couldn't do it. I really felt like I would be sick if I ate anymore. The waiter made no comment to how full my plate was when he picked it up. Probably because they had about 1, maybe 2 waiters in the whole place!  On Valentines Day! \nBecause service is so poor in Vegas, my boyfriend and I can usually look past that if the food is good. Not in this case.

This was our first visit. My daughter recommended this place and we were not disappointed. It was so difficult to figure out what to order because everything sounded so good and looked so good going out!\n\nFirst I tried the strawberry infused rum which was delicious and not too sweet at all. I did also have the strawberry Caribbean mojito drink (can't remember what it is called). It was good but I thought it had too much mint and strawberry pulp.\n\nAt the table for appetizers we had jerk calamari (not what I expected, kind of sweet), flautas (excellent) and a chorizo and shrimp dish (also delicious).\n\nFor entrees I had the special which was a pan-fried skin-on snapper with coconut rice and mango salsa (out of this world), hubby had jerk lamb chops which he loved, most had the ox tails (got rave reviews as did the spicy mashed potatoes), shrimp scampi and chicken pasta. Not one bad review at all with entrees.\n\nWe shared a slice of carrot cake among the table and it was delicious. The server brought us a slice of the most chocolaty cake that I have ever had on the house as well.\n\nIt is a loooong way from our house but we will certainly go again.

The next course was a lobster bisque with TONS of lobster in it topped with a cognac foam, which could have been warmer. The thrird course was small frozen Pignot Noir, which was most likely sweetened on top of a  frozen mandarin orange slice and mint.\n\nThe main course was a 6 oz Filet and with some huge ravioli type thing and some overly salty sauteed mushrooms. My boyfriend's filet was over cooked and dry, and 3/4 of mine was perfect and the other end was almost raw. My boyfriend loved his huge ravioli and I thought mine was gross.   Dessert was a white chocolate covered strawberry and a very tasty petite four and a glass of champagne. \n\nEvery course had some sort of alcohol infused in it, except the pears and with my glass of included champagne and my glass of wine I was nearly drunk by the time the check came.\n\nI would go eat there again on a non holiday, because the items that were good, were SO good. They were just overbooked and frazzled.  \nOne couple came and never had a waiter check on them and THEY LEFT - which I have never seen before, especially on Valentines Day.\n\nIt's worth going to for the experience.",0.0,0.9873318076133728
