After exiting the wash, we pulled out into the parking lot to see what made the sound. I found my front bumper cover was damaged. We immediately went to the store, asked for a manager, and he directed me to fill out a damage report with the car wash staff. After filling out the report, we took photos and waited for someone to contact us. \n\nAfter several weeks, I called the store to find out what was happening with the follow-up on the damage. Meanwhile, I filled a report on the damage with my Allstate agent and went to Honda for a repair estimate, which was over $1200. \n\nAfter a few more weeks, the Costco insurance agent called, said he reviewed the report, and said there was no way their equipment could cause the damage reported. I asked if he saw the photos, and he was not aware of any photos. Basically, he is in another state, never saw the damage, and made a judgment based on a one paragraph report. I had the damage repaired by Honda, paid the deductible, and now Allstate is pursuing them for reimbursement. \n\nBE AWARE OF DAMAGE TO YOUR VEHICLE, CAUSED BY THIS CAR WASH EQUIPMENT, WILL NOT BE REPAIRED, CORRECTED, FIXED, OR EVEN PROPERLY INVESTIGATED BY EITHER COSTCO OR IT'S AGENTS!!!!",0.0,0.9993626475334167

They do a pretty thorough job of quickly and efficiently cleaning cars. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a full service wash, but if you want a quick car wash that is actually going to clean your car, then Clean Freak will generally do the job. My only complaint is they do a terrible job cleaning tires. On occasion I have paid the extra for the tire scrub and felt ripped off. Otherwise, I highly recommend.",1.0,0.9792724251747132
