For the fashionistas, it's across the street from Lucky Brand Jeans.  You'll see the bike outside with a bunch of bread in it. That's the store front.\n\nWe got a baguette ($3) and a white chocolate batard ($6). I did mention that it was pricey bread but it's of excellent quality. Given the dry environment here, you'll need to wrap it up in a plastic bag to keep the moisture in if you're planning on eating in a few days. \n\nFrom my recollection, their bread has certainly increased in price from their farmer market days (there's an increase to $11 for a loaf of brioche).

I've enjoyed everything I've tried and my favorites are the BACON AND ONION BATARD and WHITE CHOCOLATE BATARD. The brioche loaves and rolls are also amazing. It'll change your life. Oh, and if you've had bread at your favorite restaurant in town and thought to yourself, \""OMGOSH,\"" it was most likely from Bon Breads - their client list is vast and impressive (they supply a list on their website). And we're fortunate to be able to visit a retail storefront for the same quality bread to enjoy at home. I've served several flavors of their batards with simple or flavored (they sell them there!) extra virgin olive oils or with cured meats and cheeses for guests and it's always a hit! I've also prepared French toast with their WHITE CHOCOLATE BRIOCHE and it was fantastic! Batards are $12 each and may seem a bit much, but it's worth it.

I'm not sure if the stock in there is swapped daily but a quick squeeze will tell you which ones are good.\n\nIt's cruel how delicious their flavor varieties are.

You expect a hard, crispy shell that flakes apart, but it's just super thick and actually pretty soft. Inside is a very dense dough with some air in it. The whole creation is quite heavy. It isn't bad, but something about it isn't awe-inspiring. It just doesn't live up to the promise of its looks. To me, a good artisan bread has the crispy and flaky light brown crust, it has the light and airy dough inside. It begs to be eaten. This just doesn't. It's just heavy bread made with [I'm sure] good ingredients and good intention.\n\nOh yeah, I didn't mention the other big one - $6 a loaf! Listen, not even the finest breads exceed $3-4.

I love their selection of treats, they have a large variety of breakfast pastries (I am a sucker for those cinnamon buns), cupcakes, breads, sandwiches, and drinks. I LOVE their rosemary bread. I always say I am gonna try and buy a loaf but I know I'll eat the whole thing before I even make it to the car.\nWhile Im not totally pleasant in the morning and I don't expect a parade from anyone in the mornings, a little more enthusiasm or gentleness in customer service wouldn't hurt. However, nothing would ever stop my from constantly coming back to Sunflour!",0.0,0.9738914370536804
