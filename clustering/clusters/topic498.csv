They were really nice and got me in fast but after I received the call that it was going to be $1250 before my brakes I was shocked. I called a friend to tell them and he said that I should really call around before spending that kind of money. I called Tempe Auto and Sun Devil Auto. They both gave me the same quote of $680 plus tax. I WAS SHOCKED!!! I could not believe that they were $500 less then what Advanced Auto was trying to charge me. I called back to let them know that I was going to take it somewhere else and when I told them where I was taking it they laughed. I ended up taking it to Sun Devil Auto which I dealt with a guy named Rolly and he was super nice and helped me with everything. DO NOT GO TO ADVANCED AUTO!!! Be warned! Go to the Sun Devil Auto on 50th St and Ray Rd. They are awesome! They towed my car for free too! I was have given them no stars but thats not an option.,0.0,0.9830202460289

Cost of SUV was 5xs the cost of regular full size sedan.

When I refused to pay the additional $150 per day, he said he would call his manager to find out \""what he could do for us\"". He walked away to \""Call his manager\"" and then came back and told us that his manager did not answer the telephone, but he could do us a favor and give us the four-wheel-drive SUV for only an additional $25.99 per day.  At that point, I knew he was trying to scam me so I refuse to pay a penny more and just asked for SUV that I had rented, even if it was a 2 Wheel Dr., rear wheel drive SUV.  He proceeded to tell me that a big snowstorm was coming in and that we may not even be able to drive up the pass with a 2 Wheel Dr. SUV.  Again, I told him to just give me the car that I paid for.  Then he said that if we got stuck in the snow, it would cost a lot of money for roadside assistance. Again i told him to just give me the SUV i paid for, even if it was a rear 2WD.  I would rather pay for chains at the Costco a few blocks away then to give this scammer a penny more of my money.  After I signed all of the paperwork, he told me that he was giving me the four-wheel-drive SUV at no extra charge. I doubt there was a 2 wheel, rear wheel drive SUV to begin with. Roads were clear and dry during our entire trip and no sign of snowstorm.  What Payless is doing ought to be considered fraud and illegal.  I felt dirty after dealing with them.

STAY FAR WAY....Run!\n\nI spoke with a man name Dee by phone, (What man calls himself \""Dee? - Should have taken as a warning sign to run). Dee quoted me a flat rate price of $50.00 provided I pay cash and write a positive review (unhealthy...quid pro quo...another clue to run - a company delivering good service does not have to ask customer to write good reviews).  At any rate, I cannot write a positive review because my experience was...anything but positive.  When the person from \""Save Money Towing\"" a.k.a \""Chandler Towing Service\"" finally showed up, after an entire - nonproductive day of waiting, I asked if his name was Dee. The little man stated, \""yes\"" to my query regarding his name.  He then asked me where my auto was being towed, again this should have been another red flag to not do any business with these people. Dee, the man I spoke with by phone had prior knowledge of where my auto was to be taken because we discussed it at length during our many phone conversations.  Initially I was going to have my auto towed to my house.  But I found an auto mechanic in the area who suggested I have the auto towed to his business.  And when I explained the change to Dee on the phone, he again quoted me the flat rate of $50.00 provided I still agreed to pay him with cash and write a positive review.  However, the person showed up calling himself Dee he had no knowledge of our prior phone conversations. This little man had a rental u-Haul hitch attached to a white pick up truck and immediately attempted to extort more money.  He stated that he was not in fact, Dee.  He emphatically stated that the he was not the owner and had no authority to alter or haggle with price.  He stated that he would require an extra $10.00 due to company policy requiring an additional $3.50 per mile.  When I asked him again if he was Dee, the little man stated he was indeed not Dee and that he did not care whom I spoke with by phone.  He stated Dee had no authority to make any decisions.  He then stated that he was in fact the owner but had lied because he does not want anyone to know that he is the owner.  My husband explained that we only brought $50.00 cash as per our telephone agreement, to which the little man stated he would have to call someone to see if accepting $50.00 to go three miles was acceptable.  This after he just stated he was the owner, go figure...After some considerable more time waiting, given I had been waiting all day for Dee to arrive; The little man came back and agreed to tow my auto to the auto mechanic for $50.00 cash.  He angrily stated he would need the money up front, to which I ignored.  I never pre-pay for services not rendered satisfactorily!!! He then stated it was a one-time courtesy, as if he was doing me a favor...the unmitigated gall!",0.0,0.9996334314346312

I was going to be late for work when my car broke down on 95 north right by Craig road. They got a driver there in less than 30 minutes and I was able to get a ride to work and be there on time. They took my car to a shop by my house and only charged me $65. I'm so grateful for their help. They made a stressful situation much easier on me.,1.0,0.9653428196907043
