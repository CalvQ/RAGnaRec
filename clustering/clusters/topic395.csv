They have been around for a while and seem to survived the downturn of the economy. Nice atmosphere with low lighting. The service is friendly and attentive.

But bar does not get too overcroweded. Which is good because its a small bar.\n\nRestaurant setting: Sleek, modern feel. Narrow restaurant with a small bar in the front.  Great outdoor seating. Really, not built for large groups as most tables are 2 or 4 tops.  We had a group of 8, and where placed in the very front window, just near the front door and before the bar. Not a highly desirable location.\n\nMenu: Some very intriguing items on the menu.  Range from pates, fish, and beef.  The chef recommended the special ribeye for 2 or 3. It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu.  The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise.  It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day. Corn on the Cob from Quebec. May be the best corn on the cob I've ever had.\n\nEnjoyed - The Ribeye for Two (or three) and the Corn Especially!  Others at the table had the Steak Frites (Flank Steak) and enjoyed it, just not as much as the Ribeye.  \n\nOther:  On the downside, service was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill.  Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant. Waiter was very nice, however.\n\nNutshell:  Very good restaurant. Pricey though. Might suggest a week night and outdoor seating over a busy weekend.",0.0,0.8173115849494934

I was told the patio seating is nice in the summer time. This evening was gloomy.  The hostess was nice.  We did not see a server for a while longer than I would expect.  Once she did come she have great suggestions for the meat and cheese board.  I ordered a German Riesling. It was a great pick if you like sweet white wine!  Our orders came in timely.  The beef carpaccio was very good.  I love truffle oil. This beef was server rolled in 4 pieces. Very small and light.  We shared but I could have had one order to myself. The cheese board was large. A generous helping of meat... Salami, prosciutto, and a spicier meat.  The truffle cheese, Gouda, and third cheese we had her choose for us seemed so small in comparison to the meat.  Toasted bread and cranberry sauce also complimented the board. Everything turned out to be more than enough for the three of us. We took an hour to eat our appetizers as we were waiting for Allegro to open. The server had not tended to out table since the food had arrived.  After the hour passed we had to wave her down.  As I was taking my last sip of wine she asked me how I liked what I had chosen.  What we are was good.  For the type of restaurant it was, I definitely  expected better service.",1.0,0.9963914752006532

I arrived at MSK and was promptly greeted, by who I think was the owner, with a warm and friendly hello. Decor and ambiance was lovely and I couldn't get enough of the rotisserie aroma throughout.

Nice wine list. There was four of us, we all shared appetizers and entrees, we enjoyed every one of them, and the prices similar with competition in the area. Wait staff warm and attentive.  I believe the owner, Tom, was in the restaurant at the time, he was fun and surprised us with dessert that we really enjoyed and again shared (the beignets with sweet ricotta, chocolate, and carmel dipping sauce). Yummy!! Over all we had a great 1st experience.  The couple we were with had dined there several times before and raved about their experience and food.",1.0,0.9998314380645752

The mushroom ravioli was pretty good but the wines in the flight were pretty unspectacular for being a wine bar. There was a hair in one of our dishes. They comped the dish and gave more Salut Fries to compensate. The fries were actually pretty tasty with an interesting citrus sauce. Eat 'em before they're soggy! Their bruschetta is not Postino's and I'll leave it at that. Cocktail drinks weren't very strong. Overall, friendly service but food was nothing to write home about. Probably not worth a return visit for me.",0.0,0.9968525767326356
