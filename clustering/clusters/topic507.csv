Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along.

Unfortunately, I'm not big on oysters.

Although, I do wish they'd buy up more space on the floor and put in a couple extra tables.. \n\nEverything they offer here is ahhmazing -both for the taste and view ;) As in their name, oysters, here are superb and a definite must order when eating here.  I highly suggest the combo pan roast which consists of shrimp, lobster, and crab. And (not or! lol) the gumbo. Just do it. You will not regret it my loves. \n\nThey charge an extra $5 if you share entrees but its totally worth it because the portions are very generous. There are no take out orders -which although can be frustrating, I do appreciate it because that means your food is as fresh as possible. And for those of you who like to fill up on soft, buttery bread, they offer that while you wait :)\n\nAnother thing I really enjoy is that you can watch the whole process of your delicious foods being prepared, cooked, plated/bowled right in front of you! The chefs are all so nice too. Makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. Last, for those of you who are going with another person who can't quite handle the heat like you, you're always welcomed to adjust the level of spice in your dishes.

The menu is pretty simple (or so it seems) how many pounds of shrimp, lobster etc... You want and what kind of style sauce or how spicy you want it...problem is have you ever measured your food intake as to how many pounds? It was a good thing we had experts with us. For for people we had about 1 lb of shrimp & about 1/2 a lb of clams with sausage and a basket of fries, it didn't seem like much for people, but when we got our plastic bags (yes the main entrees are placed in plastic bags & nothing else just like how they do it when you go eat at the pier in redondo beach) it was a lot & was definitely enough for us. Keep in mind they have no plates nor any silverware and YOU MUST LEARN TO EAT WITH YOUR HANDS! so you can savor the goodness of their finger licking Cajun style spicy sauce that your seafood is drenched in. Word of advice though, as we all already know, seafood tends to get pretty pricey, so please do order in moderation, and try as much as you can to visualize how many pounds of food your party can consume so your bill can be somewhat reasonable.
