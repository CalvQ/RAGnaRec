You pick up your cup, try out a few different flavors, then walk by the topping bar..oooh, the topping bar. You make your way to the cash register, and pay up your.. $8.72?! For a cup of yogurt? Yep, they got you. \n\nGolden Spoon proves you can get great fat-free frozen yogurt without having to pay a lot. They have about a dozen flavors at any given time and rotate every month. Within that selection are the classic chocolate and vanilla, a few fruity flavors, and rotating specialties, such as peanut butter cup, espresso, and mint. \n\nYou can try anything, and I encourage you to do so! I make it a habit to try one flavor every time I go in even if I think i'll probably just get one of my usuals. This is how I found blueberry pomegranate- turned out to be my all time favorite! I think the texture of the yogurt here is superior to other places i've been- it's ultra smooth and creamy. I barely believe it's fat free! Some of the flavors (like cake batter) are incredibly sweet, so I've come to prefer the tarts. Usually in the same machine as a tart will be a sweet flavor, and you can swirl them together! \n\nYou can add on toppings (the employees get your yogurt and add the toppings for you) for an extra fee. They are quite liberal with the amounts when you do pay for them. I've also found them to be quite flexible with letting me getting two different flavors in a container. \n\nThey have specials on different days of the week- once you establish which flavors you love, Monday is the best!

It's the best tasting, and after doing much research, it's probably the highest quality frozen yogurt you can buy.  That said, this poor review is for this location in particular - NOT Red Mango.\n\nRewind 4 months ago...  I lived in North Las Vegas for a while, and this location is in Henderson Valley.. that's a 40 minute drive!  But hey, I'm from California (the froyo capital of the world) and being that this is the only Red Mango around for 700 miles, sometimes that's just what I gotta do to satisfy the yogurt itch.  So I make the 40 minute trek over, 11:15am - lights off , doors locked, and no sign of anybody!  They're supposed to open at 11am!  I sit in my car for 10 minutes, still nothing, very disappointed, I leave.\n\nI decided to come back after a couple of weeks.  I show up at 11:30am.  Same deal.  Ok, I'm starting to think this place went out of business.\n\nI came back again earlier this month, just to see whats up with this place.  This time at noon.  Finally they're open! I saw a new sign on the door stating that beginning June 1st, the new hours will be from 11:30am - 11pm.  Like they ever opened on time anyway!\n\nOther than the time issue, their product is very inconsistent.  Sometimes its super soft and melts quickly, sometimes runny, and sometimes icy.  The owner approached me once asking how the yogurt was while I was eating it.. I said it was fine, then she started blabbing my freakin' ear off about how she had to have the machines re-calibrated that morning... she did it herself etc etc.. then she somehow got into talking about how she acquired the business... how much cash reserves she needed - which was not a problem at all... blah blah blah... I do feel bad because I think she's nice, but lady, I don't need to know all this, very distasteful! \n\nAlso, in California the prices are (S) 2.50 (M) 3.50 (L) 4.50.   This location likes to charge (S) 3.50 (M) 4.50) and (L) 6.50.  \n\nThey also charge sales tax even if you order to go.  I asked the person who rung me up why she charged me tax if it was to go, she said it's the same price for everything.

It is rich and flavorful and unique compared to other fro-yo equivalents in the area.  It tastes like yogurt, and that is not an insult.

I'm not a big fan of those places.  \n\nCame here on the evening of St. Paddy's day and the only person working was sitting outdoors watching the party across from the store at the Republic Kitchen & Bar.  That's OK, I guess if there's no one in the store there's no harm in enjoying the nice weather and people watching out in front.\n\nI thought the fro-yo flavor offerings were kinda lacking.  There were a few flavors and only one that I wound up \""settling\"" for - Vanilla Bean.  I tried the chocolate mint and really wasn't a fan.  I'm sure that's someone's thing though.  As far as frozen yogurt goes Vanilla Bean was a fantastic flavor.  And you can feel good about their yogurt because it's the healthy stuff - gluten free, full of probiotics, all natural, etc. \n\nI didn't think the service was overly friendly.  Also, we had that $5 off thing by joining Red Mango's club online.  My yogurt came to 4- something and I wasn't allowed to use the $5 thing unless my purchase was $5 bucks or over.  I guess I missed that part.  So my hubby ordered a fro-yo too and we wound up paying a lot more than we thought we would considering we had five bucks off... we only paid 3 or 4 bucks or so but still, I felt like the yogurt was kind of expensive.  \n\nSince i'm not obsessive about all that healthful stuff when I'm in the mood for some frozen yogurt I think I'll stick to Golden Spoon where the flavors are more plentiful and the prices can be pretty reasonable when you get their text coupons.

I miss the New York Seltzer they used to sell. \nBut here is a fact of these other competing yogurt shops. They have this trend of laying out a topping bar and letting the customers serve themselves. Here's the problem with that. If you are the 30th customer to purchase a bowl, that means 29 other people had handled the dispensers and the topping spoons before you. Assuming that they all washed their hands for 20 seconds.... No, wait. We can't because usually there isn't a washroom anywhere nearby. Consider how many times a person touches their face, and hair (dirt collectors) and everything else while heading to the yogurt place. \nWith Golden Spoon, 2 or 3 different people handle the utensils and dispensers all day long and they have a hand washing sink behind the bar which I make sure the employee uses before serving me. I have yet to remind them. \nPrices have barely raised since the 80's, and if you get it to go, they pack it tight for you. The weighing thing is just another tool to make money. So while Uswirl and Yogurtland are making money off of your bowl of germs, Golden Spoon gives you quality product for a reasonable price.\nBut I visited the Eastern location and after 7 months of waiting, they finally had Pistachio.

I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn't find it any different than the growing list of competition. \n\nI know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. \n\nAll of that in mind, I don't like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don't like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority. As popular as these chains are becoming I wouldn't be surprised to see \""FroYo\"" overtake \""unfriend\"" as word of the year in 2010.",0.0,0.9900357127189636

First off, who the heck knows how big an ounce of yogurt/toppings are?  They clearly mark their price at 39 cents an ounce for the yogurt and whatever toppings you want.  This doesn't sound like a lot, but the person in front of me in the yogurt \""buffet\"" line was charged $7 for his bowl of yogurt.  I was a bit smarter and only filled up my bowl a small amount.  Anyway, they should offer you a few different bowl sizes, but I bet they are banking on the fact that people will go overboard and fill the large bowls to the brim with junk.  \n\nLets back up a bit though.  Sometimes I enjoy tasting the yogurt before I committ to having it in my bowl.  Like at Golden Spoon (by far the best yogurt place) where they offer you a little cup which they fill up with the yogurt so you can actually try it.  Yogurtini has no such thing or so I thought.  Turns out you have to walk up to the counter and ask for a little cup because they don't feel like putting them next to the yogurt dispensers where it would actually be useful.  Anyway, a member of my party didn't know about the little cups and stuck her finger under the yogurt dispenser thing, pulled the lever, and had a taste.  It looked harmless enough until we saw several other people do the same thing with their dirty nasty fingers.\n\nAnyway, the actual yogurt and flavors were just ok but not even close to Golden Spoon.  Yogurtini does however have a good selection of toppings.  I did not partake, but if you are a drunk and/or stoned college kid with $10, I'd say have a blast and fill your bowl with yogurt, coco crispies, hot tamales, and marshmallows!",0.0,0.9775266647338868

After some spicy wings, I thought froyo would be the perfect way to cool off my tastebuds. \n\nAs we entered Yogurtini, I was initially impressed by the decor. Mod, space-agey furnishings in white and aqua gave me high expectations for the quality and taste of the froyo. \n\nI was not too impressed by the selection of flavors, however. There seemed to be a lot of just white/off white/vanilla varients. Meh. I tried cake batter, peanut butter, and snickerdoodle. On a side note - I think Yogurtini has the hugest yogurt cup I've ever seen in my life. I could have worn it as a fez. Who could eat that much?!\n\nThe toppings bar was where Yogurtini disappointed me. They had a large variety and a few unconventional toppings (I was pleased to see frosted animal cookies!) but the topping bar was messy and disorganized. Some of the toppings were mixed together and there didn't seem any concern for nut allergies since they were jumbled up with the fruits and cookies. My favorite topping is Reese's peanut butter cups, and I had a major problem spooning them onto my yogurt. It looked like the Reese's had been mashed with a potato masher and compacted into a solid brick in the bottom of the container. I tried to pry some out with the spoon, but they were packed so tightly that I had to use force; the Reese's ended up flying all over the place! It was like a Reese's massacre. \n\nAs for the taste of the yogurt, I was really disappointed by the snickerdoodle. It overwhelmed the other flavors, which were both so bland that they just kind of disappeared. The snickerdoodle fro-yo tasted like bad cinnamon gum to me. The texture of the yogurt wasn't bad, but definitely not the best that I've had. \n\nOverall, Yogurtini gets points for having animal cookies, thin mints (!), and decent decor.

Oh, and I can't really complain about the free Wi-Fi, either.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin however, the service is almost consistently mediocre. From my experience, the staffers there don't really speak unless spoken to, and rarely acknowledge customers until they're ready to pay for their orders. They're never rude, mind you - a lot of them just make it extremely evident that they'd rather be doing something else.\n\nI've also noticed that the tables don't seem to be cleaned very often - I routinely have to dust off crumbs or wipe off smears before I set my yogurt and/or books down on the table. Thankfully however, the problem doesn't seem to extend to the bathrooms, which have been fairly clean whenever I've used them.\n\nAll in all, Yogurtini is a decent little spot.

Nothing better than that.\n\nI suggest the Cookie Monster flavor that they have on a regular feed. But the seasonal flavors that always are popping up is amazing.  They recently had pumpkin, and it was delicious.  Had spice and tasted like a pumpkin pie filling.  The newest \""seasonal flavor\"" that I have tried is the apple pie.  It was very good as well.\n\nWatch your eye at these establishments.  You can quickly have a $5 yogurt, and will end up throwing out half of it.

The \""small\"" is really a pretty good heaping more akin to what you'd expect a \""medium\"" to be -- I typically can't finish more than a \""mini.\""\n\nGolden Spoon also offers one of those punch cards to earn free yogurt, and if you're anything like me, they fill up FAST. :)",0.0,0.7921319603919983

The staff was very friendly when we walked in.  I asked one of the workers what was different about them compared to other yogurt places being the curious guy that I am.  He told me that besides different flavors and toppings (many of which were the same though), that U-Swirl were the only ones that used 100% yogurt while Yogurtland and others used about an 85% yogurt/15% water mixture.  Whether this is true or not I have not a clue but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI then proceeded to self pour my tasty treat.

By the time I had my last two bites, it had all melted and I had a dried raisin/cranberry stuck in my teeth. I wasn't sure if it was because the almond and dried fruit toppings got mixed into the granola, or if it's supposed to come that way, but I don't really like almonds, and would've preferred my granola to just be granola. The 3 blackberries was kind of a disappointment too. Granted, there wasn't much room for more, but 3? Really? At every other one of these places I've been to, they always leave a hole in the middle of the yogurt too, but at least they leave room around the yogurt for toppings! Oh, and it was a bit overpriced, but seeing as how it's the only one of its kind in Pittsburgh, I guess he can do this.\n\nAll in all, it makes me question whether or not I'd go back.

You walk in past the cash register and head to the self-serve machines. At the very end are the cups. Take one, fill it with as much yogurt as you want (or as much as your daily calorie count will allow you to have), and select your toppings. Working your way back to the front of the store, you will then place your creation on the Scale. A number will appear, and the cashier will decode this number into the price that you have to pay. It will probably be higher than what you expected.\n\nTip: There are mini sample cups at the front so you can try before you buy. If it's crowded you can get your yogurt fix while waiting in line (or cut and run). I like to sample every flavor twice before I make my decision.\n\nThe service: Despite its hotspot location next to Wingstop and across from Inn N Out, the employees are surprisingly nice. I have tremendous respect for the patience of the cashiers.\n\nThe wait: Can be crowded on weekend nights. So crowded, in fact, that my yogurt had partly melted by the time I got to the cash register. On a Saturday night at 8PM, if there is no line out the door when you enter, something is very wrong.\n\nThe Yogurt: There's a new \""Tastes of the world\"" (Flavor Quest) line-up where they offer flavors from around the world. I tried the Dubai Vanilla Date Shake. While it wasn't weird enough for my tastes, it was reasonably good - not too sweet, not too tart, creamy enough. (My favorite flavors are the Toasted Coconut and Green Tea, not that it matters to you.)\n\nIs it Better than Yogurtology: The yogurt may not be as crave-worthy as the yogurt from Yogurtology, but it is very acceptable and the price is right.

Also, I think they have a more ice cream-like texture but since it's yogurt, I can lie to myself that this might actually be healthier than the tub of ice cream I have sitting in the freezer. But all that aside, I give this location in particular, 1 star.\n\nSo sometimes at the Tempe location, about half the yogurt dispensers are down. Fine, it's a high traffic location, machines need some care too. Whatever, I can deal with less flavors. Sometimes the toppings aren't stocked.

I'm always looking for desserts that are tasty yet won't make me fatter or send me into carb/calorie overload so I was very excited to try this place.  Tasti D-Lite's main thing is that it is supposed to have very calorie-lite and tasty frozen yogurt/ice cream type stuff.  Although I'm still not sure if it is ice cream or frozen yogurt.  They even have a nutritional comparison with most of the other ice cream/frozen yogurt places so you can see how this place stacks up.  I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nUpon entering the place you will notice that it doesn't look that much different than the 75 other frozen yogurt places that have sprung up around the valley over the past couple years.  What you WILL notice is that each of their frozen treat offerings clearly show the amount of calories in it.  Friggin GENIUS!  Almost every other food selling establishment should take the hint from Tasti D-Lite and start doing this.  I understand that the average Joe doesn't care how many calories are in what he eats, but I think a lot of people would be way better off if they are given proper nutritional information of what goes into their mouths.\n\nSo far I was impressed.  The place was nice and clean, the girl behind the counter (Megan) was very helpful and friendly, the prices were reasonable, etc.   BUT....did the stuff taste any good for having only a few calories per bite?  After sampling every one of their 5 or so flavors I was quite surprised.  Everything pretty much tasted like what it was supposed to and actually were very good.  It wasn't the best frozen yogurt stuff I've ever eaten, but it is pretty good.  Its not the creamiest, richest, or sweetest, but it is quite satisfying.  For under 100 calories for a small cup you can't go wrong.  But don't worry, you can still load your cup with the usual not-so-good-for-you toppings.\n\nListen, if you want something that tastes like Chunky Monkey then this is not your place.

Plus inside, a TV frequently is on, showing music videos.\n\nI don't have any complaints about this place whatsoever. I have never had a bad item or bad service.

I grabbed a couple cups (I was unable to talk my husband into joining me on my visit, but he was able to talk me into bringing him back some!) and went to work. I didn't mix my yogurts, although that was an option. No point for me, because all I wanted was to see if the Cake Batter was as good as Cold Stone Creamery's. And it passed the taste test! \n\n\nI went with strawberry for my husband, and then made my way to the topping bar. Oh the variety! Lots of syrups (mango flavor? Yum!), brownies, candies and fruits to choose from. And moochi! \n\nI loaded the husband's cup up with all sorts of fruit toppings: Pineapple, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry and kiwi. Plus some shaved coconut. I added a couple pumps of the caramel syrup, some strawberries and yogurt chips to mine. \n\nA nice girl asked if I needed lids (I did), offered me a punch card and rang me up.

No thanks.\nAsian-style frozen yogurt places?  Yeah, that's pretty good.\n\nIn Southern California, frozen yogurt shops tend to come in two different types:  You have the red mango or pinkberry style which have one or two flavours of yogurt that are very high quality with premium mix-ins.  Then you have other places like Yogurt World in San Diego that feature massive amounts of slightly lesser grade quality frozen yogurt but offer a hojillion flavour options and roughly eleven thousand mix-ins (including a plethora of healthy fruits and not-so healthy comfort sweets).\n\nCocomero is definitely the latter.  I like what they've done with the space previous occupied by Moonstruck, and they've made it brighter and more inviting.  The upstairs is nice, but they *do* need to fix the downstairs restroom eventually.  The flavours range from the standard tarts to the bit more flavor-specific (peanut butter, mint, blueberry), and are available to your greedy lactose-lovin' heart's content.  That said, step back and take a breath before you run in, oh you uninitiated yogurt consumer.  They give you a gigantic size cup--THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO FILL IT ALL.  Nor does it mean that you have to fill it with *every yogurt*.  Then you'll have a Flat Top Grill-style self-created disaster on your hands.  Take your time, choose wisely and make sure to get some add-ins.  Also, remember, they charge you by weight.** Maybe you don't want 8,000 ounces of yogurt today, as your snack will become both calorific and a bit expensive for what you get.\n\nOverall, Cocomero has friendly and efficient staff, the place is bright and clean, and the space is inviting.  It's well worth it to beat the heat this summer/fall.  Just don't lose your damn mind people with your massive bucket of sixteen yogurt flavours and eighty-seven add-ons that cost you $12.

She came out and said the manager would only do it with the coupon so I had to explain that twitter doesn't come with a coupon and their tweet said nothing about a coupon.  So she had to go back to get the manager to intervene.

She conceded and said that she could do it for us and to let us know when we were ready and she would personally ring us up. \n\nAt that point we had sampled a couple of flavors here and there waiting for answers and we weren't too impressed.

The flavors are fresh, they keep everything up to date and change with the season their flavors. \n\nMy personal fave will always be Pistachio, it is just that good.

The yogurt is good, slightly tart, like the Korean-style frozen yogurt (think Pink Berry and their more popular competitions) except it is self served.  The best part is they have those little mochi bits that I love ordering with my yogurt at Santa Monica's Pink Berry, and you can help yourself to as little or as much as you want.

My first visit to Tasty Yo had me hooked. Perky, creamy, and perfectly swirled with my choice of three toppings mounding over the cup.

Kokomo is an self-serve frozen yogurt joint that offers an array of eight different flavors including: Original Tart, Raspberry Pomegranate, Ghirardelli Chocolate, Cookies and Creme, Cake Batter, Tahitian Vanilla and Dole Pineapple. After choosing your flavor, you are able to top your creation with a wide variety of toppings. Toppings range from candy bars to nuts to fruits so whatever you are in the mood for, Kokomo will appease your cravings. Unlike similar yogurt joints, Kokomo won't break the bank either. For every ounce, you only pay 38 cents. Not only are the prices cheap, come often and you might just get a free yogurt that you can fill as high as you like. After purchasing nine yogurts, Kokomo awards you the tenth one free. Between my family of four, it really hasn't been hard to fill up the stamp cards. \n\nIf you have yet to try Kokomo Frozen Yogurt I'd definitely recommend the Dole Pineapple frozen yogurt with pineapple toppings. I've never tasted anything as refreshing. However, you don't have to take my word for it. Kokomo lets you taste samples before you make your decision. The yogurt texture is perfect; it's not too icy and not too creamy, just the way \""fro yo\"" should be. \n\nNot only is the yogurt delicious, the atmosphere is really earthy and modern with an natural color scheme of blue,green, white and brown. The floor is actually made of pebble tech which just adds to your experience. \n\nIf you plan on giving Kokomo a try plan on it being really busy, especially on a weekend night. It is always crowded with high school students from surrounding high schools Hamilton and Basha. However Kokomo doesn't just appeal to high school students, families and adults ranging from their 20s to their 60's enjoy Kokomo just as much as the younger crowd.",1.0,0.9968698620796204

I don't mind the limited range of yogurt flavors; I like all of their offerings except for the Vanilla, and that's just because it's sweeter than I like my frozen yogurt.  The tangy quality of the flavor really comes through in the other three (Pom, Tangomonium, and Original).  They have a nice range of toppings and I really appreciate the transparency of the calorie information that they provide.\n\nHowever, this location needs to get its crap together if it's going to succeed.  I have been there four times now, every time hoping for a better service experience before I reviewed them, but I didn't get my wish.\n\nOn only ONE of my four visits were they NOT out of at least one major topping (bananas and strawberries, primarily).  These are toppings that are included in a lot of their prefab menu items like the parfaits, so they should be prepared to use a lot of them.  They also don't do a very good job of selecting RIPE fruit; when I got kiwi a few days ago, it was like little green rocks.  Not pleasant to eat at all.\n\nAlso, about two weeks ago, when I went in with friends, Tangomonium was broken.  There was no sign or anything, and the line was very long, so I had to quickly figure out a substitution when they informed me it wasn't working.  When I happened to stop by again a full six days later, Tangomonium was STILL broken and they still had no sign or anything to let customers know.  At that point, of course, I think it's pretty ridiculous to not have it working yet!\n\nThe people who work there seem nice enough, but not terribly experienced--I got (extremely unripe) mango when I asked for pineapple once when I was there, and they also tend to dump all of your topping into a single point on the yogurt, like a little deposit of strawberries, instead of scattering it around evenly.  They also have not been prepared for high volumes of business when I've been there on nice weekend days--it's spring in Madison; you need to have adequate staff ready for everyone coming out to State Street.  This is probably contributing to their topping shortages, since I know that they cut up the fruit on-site.\n\nIn summary, I like the yogurt, but it's a little on the pricey side and I always end up disappointed and annoyed by SOMETHING when I go there.

Sometimes other places have this weird chemical-ly aftertaste that is hard to stomach...I've never experienced that at a Red Mango.  I personally like the tanginess factor, and I love the Pomegranate flavor!  (I admit the first time I had it I thought the Pom was a little weak, but I have since decided that was because I am used to enjoying things that are rich in a fatty way...which FroYo is not.  I had to readjust my taste buds.)  The chocolate is NASTY, but then again it's tangy chocolate.  That's just wrong.\n\nHere's what I hate about Madison's Red Mango:\n\nThey serve vs self-serve:  I like the control that the self serve RM's give you.  You pay by weight.  You can put as many flavors in your cup as you want.  You can have as many toppings as you want.  If I want 2 pieces of kiwi and a ton of strawberries, that's what I get.  None of this \""75\u00a2 for the first topping and whatever-the-hell for each additional\"" that Madison does.  Annoying.  And expensive if you don't limit yourself.\n\nLack of flavor selection.  At self-serve RM's there is always something I want.  On State Street, I have walked out empty handed on more occasions than I have with an actual sweet treat.\n\nIt's TINY.  I am downtown because I work there, not because I hang out there.  If the line is moving too slowly, I have to leave because my break is over.  Again, I leave empty handed.  It's amazing because I've been to other locations with 10 times the number of customers and it's taken me longer to get through the line on State Street.  \n\nToppings:  There aren't enough of them!  Come on!  I know it's a small store but what a let down.\n\nIn summary, I give Red Mango itself 4 stars but I only give Madison's 2.

I think the only difference between this place and Yogurtland is that this place has mediocre flavors.\n\nFlavors...that's pretty much the only thing that matters when it comes to frozen yogurt. While its awesome to have the basics, this place seemed to play it too safe. If I want plain vanilla and chocolate yogurt I think I'll just go to McDonald's and get an ice cream cone. The only thing this place excelled at was a plethora of toppings. I would have to say there are over 3-4 dozen different toppings. I suppose if you want a large variety of toppings then this place isn't a bad idea. However, if you're trying to eat healthy (what's the point of eating yogurt if you're not?) then what's the point of toppings?\n\nI can understand how such a coincidence could occur, both franchises probably use the same exact supplier.

On the whole, the ubiquity of frozen yogurt establishments in the Queen City is astounding. In the hierarchy of quality, however, Yoforia lands just ahead of TCBY. \n\nI have been there no less than 15 times and the yogurt is typically either icy or runny, never with the smooth consistency characteristic of higher quality yogurt. The toppings, although not as gross as TCBY, are plentiful but usually too large to be mixed in properly. There is, however, a large variety of toppings from cereal to fruit to sprinkles.\n\nI don't personally enjoy Yoforia (I'm a Tasty-Yo and Pinkberry fan), but I took my friend's 5-year-old daughter here once and she LOVED being able to choose her own toppings and mix yogurt flavors. \n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the service. I understand that it is self-serve, but it's really difficult to get an employee to come out of the back and offer a sample cup or even say hello when I've come in at off-hours. Really disappointing, compared to other yogurt places, where the staff is exceptional and engaged. I appreciate that extra human contact.\n\nOnce they remodeled and put in more bathrooms so fire code allowed for the outdoor seating, that became a plus. \n\nAll in all, if it's variety and mediocrity you're after, Yoforia is your place. It makes 5-year-olds deliriously happy. But then again, so do Dora and Diego.",1.0,0.9304298162460328

I definitely agree with the other reviewers about the stupid sample cup rule. Half of the fun is trying different flavors! EVERY time I have been there, there has been ONE sample cup sitting on a napkin, which means you have to pick your brain to decide which flavor (out of about 14) you want to try. They will not give you another cup to try more. Last time I was there, I took the one lonely little cup to try a flavor and watched as the person working there replaced it with another one tiny cup. Are they that painfully cheap?I just don't get why you wouldn't let a paying customer sample about a tablespoon of more than one flavor.\n\nTheir yogurt flavors are pretty good though, so that's a plus! :)\n\nThey do have a lot of toppings, but not as much of a fruit selection as the other shops do. I had strawberries, blueberries and maraschino cherries to choose from. Where are the blackberries/raspberries/kiwis other shops have? Wahhh! They do have a lot of cookie dough/brownie crumbles and chocolatey treats to decide from... If that's your type of thing.\n\nI'll probably still go here every now and then if I'm too lazy to drive the extra 2 miles to Zoyo, but I won't like it as much. LOL",0.0,0.9777584075927734

The oh so friendly employee who gave us an absolutely wonderful scowl when we came in turned out to be the keeper of the sample cups too. And oh such a stingy keeper she was. We got one sample cup per person to go with a  nasty look for simply asking for one. Heaven forbid I want to try the yogurt before I buy it!

There is no purpose to it other than to give patrons sticky fingers and risk cross contaminating the dispensers. Seriously, sample cup hoarding just makes me want to take that one cup, sample every single flavor at least twice, then walk out without paying a dime. [End rant]\n\nGetting back on track, the yogurt was good but the topping bar was lacking. The fruit wasn't that good and if you don't want fruit, you have a limited selection of other toppings you can pick from.\n\nOverall, with other chain yogurt shops that listen to their customer and a local shop popping up every few weeks, I'm not going to inconvenience myself to come back here again anytime soon.

If anything, I'd come here more for the games and candy than the actual yogurt. \n\nWhen I went, it was very empty. Just me, my boyfriend, a mom, and her son (or daughter). The mom and son seemed to be the family of the cashier that was working there because she kept going and sitting at there table. We went because they had a promo for free video game play going on. We thought it'd be poppin' but we were wrong. \n\nThe place is very white and very retro looking. It's pretty cool, as long as they keep it sparkling clean at all times. \n\nI've definitely had better froyo. Their selections just seemed so ordinary, especially all of the names (probably because I used to work in a frozen yogurt joint and I have seen so many cartons and selections of yogurt). \n\nI normally go directly to the tart flavorst, so I got some Mr. T tart along with other flavors like peanut butter and red velvet. They really didn't have many tart flavors, but they did have a lot of the fatty sounding ones like butterscotch, cake batter, red velvet, and chocolate cake. I didn't get any toppings, just because I never do. \n\nI recall the yogurt being a few cents more than average, but they justified their prices by saying it's because you get such \""great\"" quality. No runny, icy, or flavorless yogurt. I found it a little weird that they felt they needed to explain the price...\n\nWe got some free game tokens and played some games. They had a wide variety of games to choose from, but all I remember is Pacman. It was fun and pretty entertaining, so entertaining that I forgot about my yogurt, so I took a moment to scarf it down. \n\nThe Mr. T was not tart at all. It just tasted very plain and nothing stood out about it. The other flavors were alright, nothing I'd come back for though. \n\nWhat I would come back for is definitely the games. We played a bunch of video games and finished off with a few long rounds of Simon, which was pretty awesome. I LOVE the game Simon now. I went home and tried to find it online, but that shizz is soo expensive!\n\nPros:\n-GAMES!\n-Cool decor\n-nice, chillax ambiance\n-friendly staff\n-lots of candy\n\nCons:\n-Location!\n- bland yogurt flavors and some were actually RUNNY when they came out of the machine\n-boring flavors...they should experiment with better names to suit their theme and jazz up their flavors a bit\n\n\n*Stating things like \""You will never be a business owner\"" \""I'm sick of you wanna be worthless food critics\"" & \""You obviously were picked on in highschool\"" via message from the Owner is very unprofessional!\n*Apparently the owner's Yelp account has been hacked for almost a year now.

They have a wall dedicated to old school candy and other goodies like hot wheels. They have tables where you can play connect four and other games. They have posters with 80s cartoons like the Garbage Pail Kids and Teenage Ninja Turtles.They have an autographed picture from Chuck Norris and Charlie Sheen. It's a total blast from the past.\n\nEven their yogurt offerings have cool 80s names for their flavors.

You can also top your yogurt off with different syrups.\n\nYogurt is 36 cents an ounce which is a little pricier than some yogurt places but it wasn't too bad because we got two yogurts for a little over $8.

The West Coast tart fro-yo sensation has finally made its way to the Southeast and is suffering from a bit of culture clash if you read just a handful of earlier local reviews.  Having now had this treat on both coasts, and comparing it to the influx of other tart yogurts in town, I'm still willing to drive over to the 'berry when possible.\n\nHere's the deal, unlike the self-serve fro-yo competition, at Pinkberry the product is kept behind the counter and served to you by employee.  Yes, the servers can get a bit too perky at times and portions sizes are controlled, but they will happily let you sample as many of the flavors as you like and are good for offering suggestions for either flavor mixes or toppings to apply.  I understand the appeal of self-serve offered by the competitors, but then when I think of the number of hands involved in that process I'll gladly take, \"" What is sanitation for $100, Alex.\""  \n\nOnce you choose your flavor(s) of fro-yo you can then choose your size of cup or cone and whether you want to add toppings or not.  Toppings are unlimited once you start to add them, but that does change the price.  It's all explained pretty logically on the boards behind the counter.  If you are looking to go big on your fro-yo, this is probably not your place since sizes are set, but if you are looking for a rational treat that does not blow-out the calorie count for the day, well Pinkberry is there for you.\n\nYes, the yogurt is tart primarily and that means it is not loaded with sugar.  This is a different taste if you've not had it before.  I find it lighter and refreshing, and I like the fact the Pinkberry's flavors tend not to be \""pucker-quality\"" tart, something that I sometimes find with the competition.  There is always the original plain flavor, nice in its own right, but there is usually a seasonal flavor or two that is available for a limited time.  I can usually find a couple interesting flavors to mix.  \n\nSo I like to think of Pinkberry as more of a premium tart fro-yo experience, which fits in perfectly at its location in Phillips Place.  Can you slum it for greater volume and choice?  Yes.  But is there a difference in quality?  Yes too.  Pinkberry chooses quality over quantity.",0.0,0.677191436290741

There was a girl who stood there with cups who asked what kind of samples you wanted and let you try as many as you please. Most places don't have sample cups and if you ask for them you get attitude. Third, instead of little chopped up pieces of candy at the bar, they had very large pieces and sometimes whole candy bars!

The line is formed against the wall of yogurt and when it's a long line, my flavors have to be picked out and put into my cup and I have to wait for people to do up their toppings. I kinda wanted to try a little taste to decide on a flavor but there was no little taster cups for those (it says you have to ask- and who wants to go to the register and disrupt the line for that?).

It ensures getting people out faster and that people who like to take their time or try samples of the yogurts can.\n\nThis is the closest yogurt place by my house and is pretty good.

We've been here a handful of times since it's so close to our house. The yogurt itself is great, I love trying the new flavors and I like the fact that they venture out with unusual flavors and toppings. Most of the time, I'm faced with the \""I can't decide what flavor I want\"" dilemma and end up having way too much stuff in my cup that I never finish. On the plus side of that, the prices are excellent for what you get and we almost never spend over $10 for the 3 of us. \n\nMy problem with this location is the management, or lack thereof really. This location gets craaaazy busy and many times you're stuck waiting in line. That doesn't bother me much as getting through that line only to find out there's stuff out at the topping bar. Stuff that the employees apparently have no interest in refilling. We were in just the other night and the whipped cream was out. Which, if you haven't tried that, I highly suggest you do... it's really good. So, I looked the girl straight in the face THREE times and said there's no whipped cream and she looked at me like I was stupid. She made no effort to get more or even tell someone else that it was out. \n\nI have to assume the lazy employees and the apparent lack of management is why the store always seems to be dirty too. There's usually melted yogurt all over the tables, chairs and trash cans. Not to mention the yogurt machines themselves being dirty and the topping bar looking like a sweets tornado just rolled through. How they manage that with 3 employees standing behind that counter blows my mind. The product and price deserves an easy 4 stars but the service and cleanliness is 1 star and generally why we go visit other businesses to satisfy our sweet tooth!",0.0,0.9959827661514282

So, long story short, there was spoiled yogurt just sitting out in the open. \n\nSomehow, we weren't deterred at this point. We got our samples, and I almost vomitted. The yogurt in some of the machines literally tasted like it was sitting in there for weeks. It was spoiled. YES, spoiled. Rotten. Gone bad.

Truly the worst experience I've ever had in a frozen yogurt place. They advertise \""family friendly\"" but they are NOT!!! The staff totally ignored me (she was reading a magazine). The yogurt was soupy and had a poor flavor! Worst part that while I was there the staff played a movie on the public television screens. The film said the \""f-word\"" five times (mind you, I didn't stay to watch the entire film)as well as several other profanities. Not to mention violence, sex, and drug references. I looked up the film later and discovered that it was rated R. STAY AWAY!!! Do not bring your children to this place! Go to juju berry or Yogurtology or ANY other place!!!! Three strikes is bad enough to never go back again no matter how much I want froyo!!!!\nAlso, I wrote the company to complain trough email and snail mail and they didn't even have the courtesy to reply. I also left a message with an employee on the phone-- no reply\nhere is the update since the owner made a reply to my comment:\nSo though I do not appreciate the owner's comment below (it implies I'm a liar) he was courteous enough to reply to the email I sent him (after 10 months of no reply, but I appreciate the effort). Fortunately, I keep a very detailed journal. I was in this shop (wrote down the location as I left) on December 16, 2011 between 7pm and 8pm. He was nice enough to offer me free yogurt and an apology. I won't take the yogurt because that's not what I was after though I do appreciate that he was willing to apologize for the occurrence.\nHere is my conclusion:\nI LOVE small businesses and do my best to support them, but NOT when I have to endure profanity in a \""kid friendly\"" environment or eat soupy yogurt!\nHopefully, the yogurt isn't as soupy as it was in December-- I am not the only one to complain about this issue in my review\nIf he had answered my complaints in December, he would've been able to investigate the problem immediately.\nMy post will remain because, as I mentioned, it was my worst experience I have ever had with customer service, food, and experience in a restaurant. At least until I visit Phoenix again and perhaps I'll give it another shot (though, there are so many froyo shops I LOVE, why would I waste valuable Phoenix time in a place I don't like? I'll have to be really desperate).",0.0,0.9994114637374878

Careless folks ruin it for everyone I guess. \n\nThe yogurt wasn't good. It was very soft, borderline runny. \n\nThe toppings were lacking. If I wanted tons of candy, I would have been all set. But, since I wanted fruit, my options were limited. I could have strawberries, but they weren't fresh strawberries, it was like a chunky syrup. I could have cherries but I'd have to pick off all the stems, I could have pineapple...but I don't want pineapple, that sounds horrible on my half peanut butter, half cake batter yogurt. \n\nSo despite my dad telling me I needed to get $6 worth, I just couldn't. \n\n\nI'm glad this place isn't by my house since I have no desire to come back.

However, after visiting two other self-serve yogurt shops in the valley, I am completely convinced that I will not return.\n-The experience- not sure what kind of business opens its doors to the public but makes it impossible for them to park directly in front of the store by blocking off the first 4 parking spots available with tacky lawn furniture, a bed sheet, and hand made signs that said no parking, but this was what I was greeted with. (and yet I still went inside...somebody slap me now...the writing was literally on a rope).  I am assuming the owners were the adult couple fidgeting with the lawn furniture and flitting around the store.  They weren't friendly, they never once cracked a smile, never made eye contact with their customers (there were at least three groups of people having yogurt, and based on overhearing the register totals, they had cleared over $100 in yogurt sales in just under 15 minutes...that would make ME smile! but I guess I'm not over invested in a giant yogurt shop) The store was fairly well littered with multi-level marketing type product, business cards, etc, all with the same name on it...the owners?  Not sure, but my experience there felt like I had walked into a den of desperation.\n-The Yogurt- eh.  I didn't care for it.  But lets face it, taste is subjective.  Not sure what Yogurt Kingdom claims, but based on the overly sweet, muddled flavors, I am guessing that the yogurt flavors are not 100% natural.  \n-The Price- well, .39 cents an ounce seems to be the going rate for self-serve yogurt, so they are priced within the range of their competition.  That said, I find it extraordinarily interesting that I have been able to twice now visit other .39 p/oz establishments with a party of 4 with the same serve yourself rules set out by me-mom before serving ourselves and spent less than $1.00 more than the amount I paid for just 2 servings at Yogurt Kingdom.  Somethings not right.  I would like to assume that an error was made on the part of the cashier and that there is not dishonesty involved.-\n-The sum total of it all- there's tastier yogurt in town with friendlier people and no MLM junk who actually want you to park in front of their store and make them look busy.",0.0,0.9946278929710388

Of all the ones I tried recently (Yoppi in Tempe, Blue Ocean in Chandler Mall, Yogurtology in Scottsdale Mall, Yougrtland in Scottsdale and then revisited iTwist @ Mekong Plaza) this has got to be the worst. \n\nThe owner (or so I think) seems not to happy to give out samples but I dont want to go get a cup full of yogurt that ends up tasting not so great. (I ended up doing just that...) So after trying the original (of course since I always go for that flavour) and my sister trying cake batter, thats what we end up getting. I also asked the owner how was the reese's peanut butter was and he replied people seem to like it better then regular peanut butter but it cost more for them to have the flavour, it should of kicked in to not get it since he didn't say it taste good, but I ended up getting it also and boy was it a mistake. It did NOT taste anything like peanut butter let alone reese's. I should of stick to what I usually get at frozen yogurt shops and stay with the tarts.\n\nThe yogurts was nothing to brag about. They were a little bit on the watery side? So don't expect creamy deliciousness from here.\n\nThe topping bar was massive but messy. Makes it look unappetizing. They should have tongs for the mochi since they put it on top and when I went to scoop, it felt like the glass jar was going to fall over. \n\nI would probably return out of desperation since I live in East Mesa and this is the only one I know thats close to me but I am probably not that desperate.

I couldn't even make myself finish the cup of red-velvet I just bought. \n\n2) \""Why did you buy a cup of yogurt you didn't like,\"" you ask? Because the owner has the crazy policy that you can't serve yourself with a sample cup. He blames it on the health department and says it's the health code. Hmmm, that's strange, no other self-serve frozen yogurt shop I've ever been to has such a policy. Maybe Yogurt Kingdom is the sole bastion of proper health practices among the marketplace. OR maybe the owner doesn't want people taking a lot of samples. But hey, if you don't mind insulting your potential customer's intelligence, tell them anything, blame it on some government agency, and it'll be okay. If you do insist on getting a sample, the owner or cashier will walk to the self-serve machine and fill a sample cup for you and hand it to you. This creates two awkward problems, a) you're now dripping melted frozen yogurt juice onto my finger (that happened the first time), or b) you just touched the sample cup with your hands that's about to end up in/around my mouth. Good job with the sanitation, guy.\n\n3) Have you ever heard the phrase \""jack of all trades, master of none?\"" That's Yogurt Kingdom. They serve yogurt, waffles, french fries, hamburgers, breakfast burritos, breakfast buffets etc. I don't know if the owner did any research into how self-serve frozen yogurt establishments tend to work, but maybe he thought, \""the more we offer, the better.\"" Unfortunately, that's not true.\n\nI'm guessing this establishment is losing money each month and will be out of business pretty soon.",0.0,0.9995337724685668

So far Yogurtland is my favorite chain to visit!  This one is pretty close to my house too, so it makes it even more tempting.  \n\nWhat draws me into a place like Yogurtland is it's layout and decor.  I love the modern style of most of the Yogurtland interiors, it's kinda like an IKEA!  I love the straight lines, the use of dark wood, the colors.

Planning is good!\n\nWe go here at least once a month.  Myself, I'm more into the yogurt flavors themselves and checking out what Yogurtland has to offer on a monthly basis.  My kids however?  More into the toppings.  Little itty bitty amounts of yogurt, and lots of toppings!  This is what can make your damn cup of frozen yogurt so expensive!  And at the current 35 cents an ounce it can be quite the price for that cup.  Last time, my little one got like 3 tiny hills of yogurt and topped it mochi balls, almonds, gummy worms, cheesecake, and God knows what else...and it ended up costing me $7!  Yeah, watch your kids!\n\nI actually like the yogurt and want to try most flavors on every occasion.  But I always stick to my faves:  Taro, Plain Tart, and Coconut.  Yep, you guessed it, I'm Asian!  The only gripe I have sometimes is that Taro is not always in stock with the yogurt machines.  It should be a C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T and never, ever rotated out!  It's kinda what defines Yogurtland as being an Asian-founded frozen yogurt shop!  As for toppings I kinda go light, but I do love the fresh fruit:  strawberries, mango, lychee, pineapple, and blueberries often end up at the party.  Yogurtland froyo makes a yum-yum in my tum-tum.\n\nThis newer place seems to always be busy - it is after all located in the same area as a Rubio's, Five Guys, and Firehouse Subs.  It's like a one-stop-shop for eats!  Yogurtland is situated right in the middle so it definitely capitalizes in some after meal dessert.  I can only suspect that Yogurtland will get busier as the good ol' Las Vegas summer heat rolls around.  \n\nAre you HOT?  Go to Yogurtland!  Not so HOT?  Go somewhere else.  Just kidding!

It is pretty catchy. I love frozen yogurt and live only a couple blocks from this place. So finally i decided to go check it out. They have pretty good flavors and the yogurt is good. But sometimes it can be a bit watery. I like how they do the toppings that are in the containers on the wall that u turn the knob to get the toppings. I haven't seen that in any other yogurt shop. And they have a board on the wall where you get to vote for next weeks flavor. I also think that's a really good idea. The place looks plain to me though that I don't understand what took them so long to open. It seems like they could've put the place together in a day. I've seen them do more remolding/building in one day on a reality home makeover show. And they need to get more upbeat people working in there. The few times I've gone in there the staff has been a buzzkill. They barely said hi and when I asked them what certain things are. their reply was so dull I thought maybe they needed a hug or something. What I found funny about the place is that they ask for tips on the receipt. Its cool if you want to have a tip jar by the register. But to actually have it on the receipt at a SELF SERVE yogurt shop. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being self serving. I don't go tip the gas station after I pump my own gas at a self serve pump. And for a place asking for tips I expect a bit more of a upbeat attitude from the staff. But dont get me wrong the place is worth checking out. And the yogurt is really good and that's what matters. Im sure ill be in there often to try the new weekly flavors. After writing this review im glad the place is self serving. Cause if anybody who works there happens to read this and doesn't like what I said. I don't have to worry  about spit in my yogurt :P,0.0,0.8263192772865295

The kiwi strawberry was perfect for me because I don't like when my yogurt is too sweet. This yogurt offered the right amount of tangy flavor to counteract the sweetness.

Pretty much it always seems to be one. \n\nThere is minimal space and seating in here for traffic like that. When you walk along the shopping center, every bench is taken up by Orange Leaf customers.

No wonder everyone wants an outside bench. That's cool now...but, Dude. This is Wisconsin.

She was going to contact the supplier for more information on who the certifying body was that tests the yogurt and get back to me. It's been several months and all communication has stopped. I contact Dannon (They makers of Dream Swirls yogurt) myself and was told they would get back to me. They haven't.

Now, about the yogurt.  The flavor variety is a little disappointing.  They have original tart (a la Pinkberry, in LA, or Ice Tango, in AZ), pomegranate tart, vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and OJ.  Flavors may change, but this is what they had when I was there.  The \""regular\"" (i.e. non-tart) yogurt flavors were just okay -  I would make the trip to Golden Spoon instead, as they have the best and most variety of flavors.  But the tart flavors were very good - pomegranate was delicious, and the original wasn't quite up to Pinkberry standards (a little too icy, more like sorbet, although I prefer that to too creamy in a tart flavor), but still good.  They have a nice selection of toppings (fresh fruit, nuts, cereal, mochi, some other British stuff I'd never heard of), although it's always a little scary having it self-serve (salad bar style) so it sits out for people to get their germs on your food.

I constantly see people check-in at Mojo Yogurt. People seem to like the yogurt there. Tonight was my second visit to Mojo. I probably would not have gone there normally, but I met some friends that that were already at the Biltmore shopping. \n\nTonight I tried three different flavors chocolate, vanilla, and lemon icebox. The vanilla was by far the best. I am a chocoholic but the chocolate was way too sweet and over the top. By this I mean that it remind me of the time when I was a kid that I tried to drink Hershey's Chocolate Syrup out of the can. I didn't like the lemon icebox at all. Again, it was too sweet.

I will call them Iman, Harry Potter, and Chrissy Snow. \n\nIman was working her butt off. She was constantly in motion cleaning tables, picking up trash, and working the register. Harry and Chrissy were socializing and watching Iman do all the work. There were only a few customers when we arrived, but that quickly changed and the store became quite busy. By the time we got to the register, Iman asked Harry for help. He is the one that weighed our yogurt and rang up our purchases. When my friend pulled out a coupon, Harry let out a loud sigh and snapped, \""You know you have to fill out the back of the coupon.\"" At this point Chrissy disappeared to the back of the store. \n\nA few minutes later I noticed that Iman was back on the register by herself, and Harry was outside chatting with a couple that I assume were his parents. The line at the register was growing longer, and you could tell customers were becoming frustrated. Iman was also visibly frustrated with Harry. She kept shooting exasperated looks at him outside. I heard Harry's mom tell him, \""She looks busy, you should go back in and help her.\""\n\nHarry continued chatting with his parents, and the line at the register became even longer. Iman looked frustrated and was working her little heart out trying to wait on customers. Finally, Harry relented when his mom again told him to go back in and help Iman. It was very obvious that Iman was doing most of the work, and that the others were just there. \n\nI know that this is just a self-serve yogurt place,  and I should not expect the same service that I would get at a sit down restaurant. However, it was a busy Friday night, and you would expect that there would be adequate service to move customers quickly through the line.

Looks like it just opened, and it was busy.\nTurns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready.\nThe burger patties are different... they're about 1/8\"" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the \""value basket\"" deal.\nTheir frozen yogurt or \""concrete mix\"" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their \""brownie cookie dough\"".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum! \nOkay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.

Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  Their space (which used to be a Marble Slab) is way too small for that kind of layout: people were tripping over and stepping on one another because there just wasn't enough room. The staff is nice, but disorganized and too persistent.  The girl working asked me five or twelve times if I wanted a tasting cup, and the cups themselves were at the register instead of at the froyo dispensers.\n\nFinally, I was disappointed in the yogurt itself.  The first couple bites were okay, but it soon became all but flavorless. It wasn't really worth the calories at that point.\n\nPerhaps I shall try Sweet Frog again, especially since Chad's experience seemed to be better than mine.
