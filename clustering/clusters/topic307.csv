I showed up about 5 minutes to closing and the lady at the counter said \""sorry guys we're closing\"" and gave us a hand gesture to \""get out the door\"".  First issues I have with this - I have been in retail/ customer service related positions for the last 10 years of my life.  I find it ridiculous and horrible business to dismiss someone just because the closing hour is coming up.  The correct response to make a sale would obviously be \""we're closing in 5 minutes, anything can help you find quickly?\"", but alas, even that was beyond the capacity of this staff. \n\nHere's the cherry on this cake of crap. As we were pulling away from the greenhouse with our windows down, we heard someone yelling \""help me! Help me!\"" We looked inside the gated area which had obviously been locked due to the magical 5:00PM closing hour the staff were so keen to make, and there was a lady LOCKED INSIDE THE GATE... I kid you not, the staff was in such a hurry to lock the store and get out, and they literally LOCKED SOMEONE IN THEIR GREENHOUSE. I immediately jumped out of the car, told her I would let the staff know and strolled up the door.  A lady came and unlocked it, and I told her \""You locked someone in your greenhouse.\"" She laughed it off and then slammed the door in my face. \n\nSo just to recap, horrible customer service, horrible attention to detail, and horribly unfeeling staff. I have to say this is easily one of the WORST experiences I have ever encountered and I very much hope this reaches the ears of the staff - I certainly will not be buying local from these people any time soon.",0.0,0.9996036887168884

I have been a loyal customer to this store since it opened and have seen the decline.  One lane open on an extremely busy Friday night? Seriously?  Have been there numerous times, different days, different hours and its always the same story.  Line of 20 people and one register. If u want to wait 30 to 45 minutes to check out, this is your place. I once waited over one hour in line with one register open on the day before a holiday.  When I talked to the manager as to why she couldn't open more registers, all she said is that it wasn't her fault as she doesn't do the schedule. I saw over 10 people walk out the line to complain to her.  She could of opened a line herself to help.   Sad to say, I have to avoid this Walmart.  All it does is piss me off due to the lack of workers and customer service.",0.0,0.9994781613349916

They promised that they would do an inventory and hand out vouchers for the phone we wanted, allowing us to leave and come back any time that day to get our phone. That promise never happened. I then was told that the store was allowing people to purchase up to two phones at a time. This is absolutely insane to do on a launch day.

The bad thing about it is that this location is 5 min. from my home. I'm BIG on customer service- I have to deliver the best everyday to my clients and I expect the same. \nAnyway NO 5 Stars due to that happening to me today.",0.0,0.9984484910964966

I give LoveSac 5 stars for their product. Love love love it.  We have their Sactional series and think it is the greatest thing, great quality, fun to configure, soft, comfy.  So definitely you can not go wrong with the product.  \n\nHowever, good luck dealing with the staff.   Every single time we have bought something, it is like having all of our teeth pulled.  It feels like they have no idea what they are doing.  Luckily, we have gritted our teeth and stood our ground, and everything has worked out each time.  \n\nBut on a recent visit, we were one of at least three customers in the store with complaints and problems in a 10-minute period.  Shouldn't they realize that if so many people are complaining, they should do something about their customer service?  Plus give more respect to repeat customers?  Order online instead to get the great product and have more control over your transaction!\n\nUPDATE:  I want to say that  \""Roy\"" has definitely come through for us this time and impressed us with his initiative; go Roy!  But this weird service issue has been ongoing since 2010.  So like I said, it usually works out, and there is at least one conscientious staffer, but in general the service is frustrating.",0.0,0.8616575002670288

I was actually told to go to Kinkos if I needed the work done that day.. I needed 40 copies of a document in color..and the manager.. he just stands around with a befuddled look and shrugs his shoulders.. be sure to visit Nicole.. for a unique experience in bitchy attitude and helpfulness.. so special..the only Office Max in Scottsdale with stellar service is the one at Desert Ridge..

I spent $156 in RC parts to include a set of TRAXXAS JATO Front and Rear Wheel sets as a Christmas present to a family member.  As it turns out, the wheel set was purchased in error and asked for a refund ($33/set).  Upon calling the day after Christmas to see if the store was open, I was surprised at the lack of customer service and overall rudeness of the store manager (for which his father is the owner).  He said, \""don't you read the reciept...no exchanges for store credit only\"". I said that how would I know that if the reciept is handed to me after the purchase...not before.  He then said, \""It's a store policy not to provide refunds... it's written on the back of our register\"".  Again, I don't normally read everything posted in a store.  Why didn't they inform me verbally of this policy before purchasing the items?  The overall demeanor of this guy was absolutely unacceptable and I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS STORE AGAIN!  I would NEVER recommend anyone to go there.  You'll find prices and service much cheaper online.  Read these reviews and you'll see that Hobby Town USA in Gilbert Arizona don't deserve OUR business.  I ususally don't bother with reviews, but these people pushed me over the line....I will do my best to place my honest review in every site available to expose the truth about this business.  Next call will be to the Hobby Town corporate office...they need to know that their name is being trashed in AZ.",0.0,0.999738872051239
