So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp. Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot again...resulting in it being dryer than dry. Ekkk. Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease. Literally. She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up. Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter.

I've been to Olives two or three other times and either I'm getting more difficult to please or their food is going downhill because we left a little disappointed. There are still some good items on the menu like the butternut tortelli.

Don't forget that you can order half portions of their pastas if you'd like to sample several dishes.\n\nThe disappointment started with the beef carpaccio. The serving size is so ridiculously large that it looks unappetizing. There's a huge softball-sized mound under the center of the beef full of greens. The dish is also drowning in sauces that dominate in flavor and all of that wonderful beef flavor is lost. There's just too much going on. The dish is large enough for 4-6 people.\n\nThe next disappointment was the ribeye special. The overcooked and bland steak had all the appeal of a choice cut, $2.99 special from your local grocer.

Twice for lunch, once for dessert, and once for drinks.  Each time this place did not disappoint.  It's located just inside the Bellagio, near all of the shops that sell things which very few people can afford.  They do have a small, but nice outdoor patio.  They have big umbrellas and misters to help you avoid the heat.  It has a nice view of the fountain show if you eat out there at night.\n\nI tried several different things while I was here:  Caesar salad, complimentary bread, gnocchi, cheeseburger and fries, rasberry mojito, and some cookie ice cream sandwiches.

It was full of flavor, and it was huge.  I don't think you could go wrong with most anything on the menu, though.  It's probably better to come here for lunch, as everything is a little cheaper.

Since I'd had a leftover gift certificate from the spa with $30 remaining on it, I decided to go downstairs and have a healthy breakfast at their cafe, while she enjoyed the toasted bagel and cream cheese ($4) she sent me down to a hotel coffee shop to get for her as she got ready. I sat at the counter reading the Vogue magazine I tried to conceal as I waited for the mushroom frittata ($14) I ordered. When it arrived, I was in love with the presentation. I have a weakness for dishes/kitchenware/anything that is manufactured in miniature proportions, so the little cast iron ramekin filled with puffed golden brown eggs that were studded with mushrooms immediately pleased my eyes. Then I took a bite. Not only were the eggs as hard as rocks but they were completely devoid of flavor and the accompanying potatoes were terribly undercooked. Being the high maintenance woman I am (when it comes to food), I sent it back and tried my Vegas luck with the breakfast relleno ($13). This was a poblano pepper stuffed with organic eggs and chorizo topped with low-fat cheese over polenta. This was much better, however, no matter how hard I tried to like it (and I really did try), after a few initial piping hot bites the flavor started to take a turn for the worse and I was reminded of its uber-heathiness. I enjoy healthy food, in fact I love it, but I don't believe in eating something healthy if you don't think it tastes great, or if it is over-priced. So, I consumed my two small cups of decent fresh fruit dressed in lemon juice, asked for the check, and headed back to the room to share my mom's more satisfying bagel.",0.0,0.9792990684509276

My mom had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was alright, the grilled veggies were so soaked in better or oil that they were almost uneatable.  I'm of the belief that if you have quality produce you don't need to soak them in butter after grilling and before serving.  My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright.  Skinny ritas are not to be missed, hands down the best part of our meal, skip the lemon drop though.  Also just a note for the bartender, I had the first cosmo I'd had in a while (just sounded yummy) and it was full of tiny pieces of lime, like lime pulp it was terrible.  At $9 I shouldn't have to strain my own cocktail.

It is a very small restaurant and fairly easy to miss, if you're not looking for it. The interior is also quite small, but has adequate tables in front of a small ordering counter. Although for dine in, the waitress will come to your table.\n\nI ordered the jerk chicken and my mom ordered the goat curry, which they were unfortunately out of. (I had been looking forward to trying that dish, too!) So instead she ordered the brown stewed chicken. For our sides we both selected the rice and beans (which they list as \""rice and peas\"") and mixed vegetables. One small problem: the entrees are supposed to come with two side dishes included. However, apparently the second menu line of sides are upcharged $2.50. There really is no distinction between the lines, so we ended up paying an extra $5 for mixed vegetables (two orders). It's fairly misleading on the menu.\n\nThe food however is DELICIOUS. And if I could break the ratings down, I would give them:\n\nFood: 5 stars\nService: 3 stars\nSpeed: 2 stars\n\nThere was only one lady working (plus the cooks in the back) so it was very slow just to get our order, bill, etc, but I felt bad for her as she really was doing a good job but just had her hands full. I'm wondering if it is usually only her or if they were just short staffed that night.\n\nAnyway, the food was remarkable!! My jerk chicken was spicy, but not excessively so. (But still very spicy! Beware!) Both chicken dishes were extremely tender and juicy, just the way I love meat. Both of the dishes tasted authentic, including the fairly runny juices surrounding them. (And my family used to live in the Caribbean, so they tasted like what we were expecting.) My mom's brown stewed chicken was not excessively salty, which she liked.\n\nThe rice and beans were also excellently spiced but not greasy. The mixed vegetables (which included zucchini, cauliflower, onions and carrots) were good, but not that authentic and unfortunately they were out of the greens that night.\n\nI would certainly go back, and I am hoping to return soon in order to try the goat curry! I also want to try the Jamaican rum cake on their dessert menu. If you enjoy adventurous eating (especially in Pittsburgh!) I encourage you to check out Royal Caribbean. :)",1.0,0.83933025598526

Instead, it was a room with mostly white walls, a black ceiling, and crappy dining sets.  Sure, the food is pretty cheap and I don't expect much... but come on, the ceiling tiles look like they have been spray-painted.    \n\nOn the upside, the waitress was very friendly and helpful.  And hey, I got the Groupon as a gift, so I'm thankful.  But would I come again and pay full price?  Not a chance.  Two stars.\n\nEDIT:  In the interest of full disclosure, the manager of A Thyme For All Seasons contacted me and offered to have me come back in for a better experience.  Although I have not been back (it's a pretty far drive for me), I bumped the rating up a star because I appreciate managers who are willing to try to make things right for the customer.  I have also heard that things have gotten better in recent months, so take my review with a grain of salt.",0.0,0.9986268281936646

My mom wanted to go here for Mother's Day so my sister booked a reservation. After our entire party arrived (party of 5) we were promptly seated in a nice booth by the lobster tank. Our waiter Andrew arrived shortly after and took our drink orders. Drink orders were out quickly and all seemed to be going pretty well.\n\nThe food is where I had a problem. I ordered charbroiled scallops and my mom had the same I also got macaroni and cheese and corn as sides. My fianc\u00e9 got the sirloin cooked medium with baked potato as he isn't much of a seafood lover. The food came out in a fair amount of time. When I took the first bite of one of my scallops it was okay but it seemed kind of gritty which is not very appetizing. The second one was chewy on the side and so rubbery that I had to spit it out. I was pretty turned off on the scallops at this point. The mac and cheese was dry and seemed reminiscent of cafeteria mac and cheese which is much different than the experience I had the last time we were here. The last time we ate at King's I had a separate side of mac and cheese brought out and the noodles were nicely cooked and the cheese was great. This time, overcooked noodles, not much cheese and dry. The corn was decent. My fianc\u00e9 had the sirloin and this is not a cheap sirloin by any means. It was not cooked medium and just did not have much flavor. No seasoning and pretty fatty and not in a good way. His baked potato was dry as the Sahara desert even with butter and cheese, it looked like it had been in the oven for an hour too long.\n\nWe should have asked for a manager and sent our food back but it was Mother's Day and my mom was enjoying her time. I didn't want to be the pain at the table sending back food. For the price that we paid for this meal it was not in any way worth it. I would not come back after this experience.\n\nOur waiter Andrew was also very frazzled and almost forgot to charge us for part of the meal. He did not come back very often to refill drinks. I understand that it was very busy and I do cut him some slack but he's got to be able to handle a high business restaurant if that is his job.\n\nOverall very disappointed. Based on this experience with the food I would not recommend King's Fish House.",0.0,0.986153244972229

It was fine but I would to have liked a real option.  Both my sandwich and smoothie were delicious.  My mom had the Dutch and a french press which she raved about.  The reason I'm saying 3 stars is simple.  The place could use a face lift, the booths are trashed.  And service needs some major improvement.  We had been told the french press came with free refills but she never came back to refill the coffee which was gone before our food arrived.

The portions were smaller and the presentation lacked from before, but the price certainly didn't change which for what we got vs. what was paid for well I'll leave that up to your imagination of where I planned to go with that.\n\nOnce again we definitely indulged in the menu and held nothing back that night. e collectively shared the Baked Scallop Roll, the Baked Lobster Roll, the Kobe Surf and Turf Roll, the Spicy Tuna Roll, and another one with Shrimp that I did not catch the name of (it was a \""secret\"" one not offered on the menu that was suggested).\n\nThe Baked Scallop Roll and Lobster Roll were missing the sushi sauce and flakes that it had been presented with during my first visit which I was really bummed about. However I will not discount the taste because it still ranks up as one of the best I've had to date. The Surf and Turf roll I really recommend because this hands down was the best of the night. I think the man in me says it was the Kobe Beef that partnered with the sushi part of it just sky rockets into taste oblivion. \n\nAll in all, I wonder what brought on the change to the presentation of the food, but it still by far is one of the better sushi locations I've inhabited. I can't say I'll never be back because I'm sure I will, but I'm not exactly having an itch to return after seeing the overhaul to my loved establishment.

It was nice to have the place to ourselves for about an hour. Our waitress was very lovely and helpful.

The artichoke dip included chorizo, goat cheese and corn relish, definitely something my sister wasn't expecting. I thought it was awesome! They have their own little recipe to give plain artichoke dip a bigger bang! My mom enjoyed every bit of her brushetta and my sister spiced up her mac n chesses with the waiters recommendations! 3 out of 4 happy in our family never really happens, so my hats off to you D'Vine!

Next door, she noticed a restaurant, Pier 54. She mentioned she'd like to try that out for lunch before she left. So we did.\n\nService: Bad. We arrived around 11:40, 40 minutes after they opened. We walked onto the patio/deck, and didn't see a server at all, so we just sat ourselves. After a good 15 minutes, a waiter walked out and took our drink order. Another 10 minutes, drinks arrived, and we decided to place our order then. We didn't receive our food for another 20 minutes or so. We didn't mind TOO much, since it was a nice day and we had a nice view of the man-made lake.\n\nFood: I ordered the Fish & Chips and both were pretty good. Sadly, the fries were probably the best item we tasted. My Fiance had the regular burger & fries, and her burger was over-cooked and very dry and lacked flavor. My fish, was battered to perfection, although, the middle of the fish (most dense area), was cooked, but the consistency was different from the fish on the outer edges. Kinda mushy and not as appetizing. I enjoyed the ends and outer edges of the fillet of fish the most. My mom had the 1/2 sandwich & soup- roast beef panini & clam chowder. I took a bite of the panini, nothing special. Not gross, but not GREAT. its just ok. The clam chowder had a great flavor, but was awfully runny and thin and not as thick as most chowders. There wasn't many items: potatoes, clams, etc in there either. I was mostly a thin chowder broth.\n\nIn the end, I don't think we'll be back. Great location and nice atmosphere (minus the annoying bird that kept squawking all day long), but it was nice to enjoy the weather, the view and the ducks in the lake). I dont know why the service was soo slow, on a sunday, with only 3-4 tables. (more arrived as we left, but we were still shocked by the slow speed of the waiter). He was friendly, so I give him that, but we were really looking forward to this place, and it let us down quite a bit.\n\nIf you dont' mind slow service and can use a very laid-back atmosphere, then you'd like it.

So this is a sit down place! They emphasize that they are not fast food. \n\nThis is fusion Mexican and Korean food. Great concept! This is what I'd consider a whole in the wall.\n\nThey brought out complimentary chips with salsa and guac. Small serving but complimentary so not a complaint at all. Just a note.\n\nWe shared kimchi fried rice and a bulgogi fusion burrito. The kimchi fried rice was good! We got a full serving for $10 I think? And we added an egg on top which was extra. It was full of kimchi flavor, it was saucy, and the egg on top was delicious. We had it with beef as the meat of choice.\n\nThe burrito was kind of small for the price and wasn't anything special. I don't know if I ordered wrong and just got a regular beef burrito but the flavor of bulgogi wasn't present to me. It tasted like they used fresh ingredients but it really lacked in flavor. It wasn't bad but I just was expecting a lot more flavor. There was nothing that made it \""fusion\"" except the meat but that didn't really work out for me. \n\nOverall I'd give this place a 3 or 3.5 based off of this experience. \n\nSome suggestions would be to change their service. They don't do the whole server and sit down thing well and would probably benefit to just do a Roberto's type of ordering thing. Otherwise they should have a real service. Like get a host stand would be step one. I don't want to go into detail but I just think this would really help. Or maybe a number system. \n\nAlso maybe it was just me but they should marinade their bulgogi more. \n\nThe Kim chi fried rice is really good though. They don't shy away from the Kim chi flavor and that's a good thing. My mom hates eating other Asian foods that aren't Thai and she actually raved about this. The fried rice was the saving grace. \n\nThe young woman working was nice and I'd totally go back to try other things and give them another chance.",1.0,0.9772006273269652

I didn't feel like a wrap so I don't know if they have updated that section or not.  They actually only had one option for dessert, and I wish that I would've known that prior to walking in, as the black forest cake looked delicious, but was a bit dry in my opinion (had to eat it later on since I was so stuffed).  \n\nI was lucky enough to find a parking spot when I did, since it is in a plaza that shares parking with a lot of other restaurants and shops.\n\nI like this place and hope to return at another time since I did like the food, atmosphere, and service.

We ended up trying the katsu skewers, rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice tuna, chicken kaarage, fried rice, and crunchy california roll.  Everything was pretty tasty, the only hang up I had was the crispiness of the kaarage, some of the batter/coating was coming off of the chicken breast pieces, but I must say the chicken was very moist.  I don't generally do fried rice since it seems to Americanized to me, but the fried rice is pretty awesome in flavor with some sprinkled seaweed in the mix.

The service was helpful, and the wine list couldn't have been better.  The Napa Cabernet by the glass is AMAZING! I will have to call and get the name for my own satisfaction but so smooth, the perfect wine.

I don't usually comment on the complimentary breads but oh my, that had to be the best pretzel bread I've ever had! I ordered the free range chicken for my entree.  The food took about 40 min after ordering to be brought out to the table, I thought that was a bit long but the atmosphere was comforting enough to let it slide.  When my chicken came and I cut into the juicy breast, my taste buds went crazy! It was so delicious, my mouth is watering just reciting the memory! My husband got the New York steak, of course I had to try a piece and man was it charred to perfection and so tasty! The Brussels sprouts with bacon we're great along with the asparagus, and the corn.  The mashed potatoes seemed a bit plain to me, but other than that the experience couldn't have been better! To finish off dinner we all split a lemon cheesecake that made your taste buds disregard the full stomach and dig in for more. I loved the experience, the boutique, elegant, Gatsby feel.

I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust. I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one. I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm. I was not so thrilled with the \""icing\"" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom. I liked it but I didn't love it. I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better. It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect. Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake. \nMy mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes. I can't.

I feel kind of bad because my experience here was very nice, except.. it was the first time in my life I've ever sent food back because I couldn't eat it. \n\nService was quick and efficient and we were seated right away. My mom ordered the crab cakes (which I almost ordered, and bet that if I had, this review would be 4 or 5 stars) and a side of fries. I got the fish tacos with a side of fries. Food came out pretty quickly, and my mom and I were both completely in love with our fries -- they had this almost crumbly, crisp coating on them that just made them heavenly, and the right amount of seasoning. My mom raved about her crab cake, but my fish tacos were inedible. :( \n\nI discovered fish tacos last year when we visited The Goat in Put-in-Bay and have been getting them every time I see them on the menu someplace ever since. I've loved them every time, but this time I got a mouthful of dried cabbage and nothing else for my first bite, and my second bite was filled with VERY fishy, off-tasting fish. I'm known to be kind of picky, so I thought it was just me and tried another bite. Still off. I had my mom taste it, and she was kind of appalled -- so that's when I knew it wasn't just me. \n\nI explained this to the waitress, and she said she'd talk to the kitchen. When she came back, she said she had taken the fish tacos off the bill and that the kitchen would be happy to make me something quick. Honestly, I was full on those fries, so I said no -- but she must have apologized a hundred times, and was very sweet about the whole thing. So.. being my first experience sending something back, I was nervous, and it couldn't have turned out better. \n\nI honestly think that I just got a mistake. And it happens. I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to go back and give them a second chance.

The hostess was very friendly and seated us very quickly. Our waitress was okay. She wasn't very enthusiastic or knowledgeable about the menu or great at making suggestions for first time diners. But she kept the coffee and water glasses full and got our order so I guess that makes up for it. \n\nEveryone ordered something different, so we could share and before we knew we had pancakes, french toast, a meat omelet, bacon, hash browns and grits flying around the table. \n\nMy favorite by far was the french toast, it's made on challah bread and ready thick and filling with a touch of powder sugar...yum! \n\nEverything else was just pretty standard. Not bad. Just standard. There was one small downside, I wasn't a fan of the grits...perhaps that's my fault because I was secretly comparing them to Flying Biscuit...oh well! \n\nI mean I'm not writing this place off completely. I definitely want to try their lunch and dinner options. But for now, this place is just A-Ok. \n\nOn a personal note, there's a waitress there named Mary and even though she didn't wait on us she is super friendly and extremely professional. As we were leaving she chatted with us, and even complimented my grandmother on how good she looked for her age...she also made sure to thank us for coming in and told us to have a great day.

The woman brought out my food, outside, after I told her I my step-dad was watching the baby in the truck.  Oh and I received my food roughly 10minutes after ordering.  One thing i noticed (while I was ordering) was I saw they have the traditional gyro loaf and slice off of it for each order.  My to-go order was a gyro combo with a greek salad instead of the fries.\n\nThe greek salad was very tasty!  The dressing came on the side, so I could control how much I wanted on the salad.  The gyro was on the greasy side, which was a little offputting.  And there wasnt any lettuce or tomato on it.

Well, clearly we should have kept walking. The service was not good, I don't think our waiter smiled once during the entire meal, and didn't offer any suggestions, and it took a for him forever to even come over and take our drink orders when we first arrived. Come to think of it the service was slow the whole night.\n\nI won't complain about my meal because out of the three it was by far the best. I got the fish and chips and it was really good, and a huge serving. There were three cod fillets and a large helping of fries. The tarter sauce was probably the best I've ever had. That being said my mom ordered the scallops, and the presentation was awful. They brought it out in a large bowl probably three sizes too big for the amount of food that was in it. There were only five scallops sitting in a broth with carrots. No presentation at all, and for the price of that meal with absolutely no side included it was far from worth it.\n\nMy brother ordered the lamb burger and fries, and his serving of fries was about half as much as I got, which was a little confusing. The burger had too many flavors that did not mesh well together. The menu selection didn't offer enough choices in terms of meat, there was only once chicken dish. The drink menu was pretty good, but they were all pretty pricey, and for the amount of wine my mom got in her first glass it was not worth the price at all, I think it counted as \""half a glass of wine\"" so it should have been half the price.\n\nThe interior was very nice and very \""British.\"" Our chairs were arm chairs that you would normally think of for a restaurant but they were very comfortable and made waiting for our food relaxing.

I'm guessing that, like many restaurants, they were going through some opening jitters but seem to have worked them out. \n\nThe menu items are a mix of Italian and seafood dishes. We started out with the Date Lollipops and the Cuttlefish appetizer for the table. The Date Lollipops were really good - a tasty combo of dates, bacon, and blue cheese. The cuttlefish appetizer was pretty good, reminded me of fried calamari, but a softer texture. \n\nFor a main courses, we had the seared scallops, wreckfish, roasted prawns, and the maccheroni alla chitarra (a dish with salmon and pasta in a vodka sauce). We shared tastes of the dishes and decided that the winner was definitely the scallops - they were very well prepared and served with risotto and a sweet jam. \n\nI was very impressed with the service, food, and atmosphere.

We have a lot of BBQ places back home so walking into Pot Liquor, our standards were going to be high.\n\nLuckily for us it was Customer Appreciation Day at Pot Liquor. That gave us 25% off our meal. We lucked out since our meal ended up being about $30 for both of us.\n\nMy mom ordered a half rack of the \""mopped\"" ribs with collard greens and the kale and cashew slaw. She said that the collard greens were sweet and not to her taste. She is used to more savory collard greens in Louisiana... usually cooked with smoked ham so I guess she wasn't prepared for them to be sweet. The only recommendation would be that they carry the tobasco peppers in a jar on the tables. This is a common condiment served with collard greens in the South.\n\nShe loved the slaw and commented that the ribs were some of the best she had ever had. They were very flavorful and tender. \n\nI also ordered the ribs and they were awesome! The fries came with \""Alabama White Sauce\""--which seemed to be a vinegary mayo based sauce. I usually opt for ketchup with fries but I didn't need it since the white sauce was so good. I also had the mac & cheese which I personally liked. Keep in mind that it's homemade style and not like the crap in the blue box. TIP: mix it up well before you dive into it so the cheese gets mixed all around.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. The service was excellent. When our server, Paul, was busy, the manager on duty had no problem stepping in and refilling our drinks.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean, spacious and beautifully designed. I will definitely be back.",1.0,0.998214840888977

Couldn't figure out if it was salisbury steak, or something more sinister.  $15 for 3 of these monstrosities was criminal. The calamari was tasty, but skimpy, and again luke warm.  The caeser salad was bland, with absolutely no flavor, and next to no dressing.  \n       Ordering the 'signature' rib eye for the main course was another huge disappointment.  $31 for a steak 3/8ths of an inch thick is absurd.

We have both been here several times and it is always really good. Mom does the cooking and her recipes are executed and seasoned to perfection.\n\nLocated in a small strip mall next to the hardware store. This place is small but cozy and very simply decorated. They have an assortment of table sizes based on your group. The larger tables can easily accommodate those bigger family occasions.\n\nNormally come here for lunch and get one of the specials. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. You can also request something off the dinner menu if you wish. This is a larger menu with items that are a little bit more fancy.\n\nMy favorite so far is the Moroccan Chicken. She makes mine extra spicy and it is delicious. The Kebabs are also very good and the Salads are humongous. Mom's top secret Rice is so good that it just melts in your mouth. It is covered with toasted raisins and almonds and is at the top of my list to reproduce at home.\n\nService is very friendly and helpful. You are always told to make yourself at home. They go out of there way to answer any of my questions or request.\n\nFood is always fresh and tasty and we always leave feeling full. Still have not had a chance to try out any of the many tasty desserts. Good reason to come back sooner than later. YUMMO!\n\n4.25 STARS,1.0,0.9997596144676208

I'm not sure. After hearing the rest of my family rave about it for weeks I finally had the chance to try it when I was in town visiting mom.  At 10:30am on Friday there was only a very short wait.

The coffee was very good and the beignets are SO good, seriously. . . order yourself some beignets you will NOT be sorry. After that things sort of went down hill for me. Mom's omelet was very good. My beef and seafood benedict just . . . wasn't. The English muffin was soggy and rubbery. The crab/seafood mixture was awfully 'fishy' and the hollandaise sauce was really REALLY lemony and didn't sort well at all with the crab/seafood mixture. The beef was very good but didn't really make up for the soggy rubbery English muffin. All in all just not good. I'm aware that some of this may just be me ordering poorly. But I've had lots of benedicts in lots of different places and the good ones always have a nice cutable with a fork English muffin. I'm very willing to try them again and am totally open to giving them 4 stars but for now I'm going to go with 3. They are also a bit on the expensive side 40 something dollars for breakfast for two and an appetizer seems a bit much. But it is Ballantyne so . . yeah.

My Mom wanted to order the half sandwich/salad option.  She wanted the same TAB sandwich and one of their salad items, a strawberry something salad.  She was told that the only salad options were a garden or ceasar salad, so she opted for a garden salad.  It took easily 30 mins for the order to arrive.  \n\nIn the meantime, the restaurant started to fill and it became obvious there were only two servers working the entire south side of the restaurant.  The order arrived and my mother's order was wrong.  She was given a full sandwich with a side salad which, once we got the bill, we realized the waitress got wrong and did a salad substitution instead of the other sandwich side options which added almost $2 to the bill.  Given that the waitress pointed out the half sandwich options, not sure why the order wasn't correct.  She was completely unavailable to straighten it out.  For a sandwich that is named with avocado sharing the spotlight with turkey and bacon, it isn't unthinkable to expect a few actual slices of avocado in there.  Both sandwiches had so little avocado, I had to take a pic and include it with the review.  The bread was average whole wheat bread.  A better quality of bread could have really upped that game.  One highlight was the battered sweet potato fries.  \n\n Would I try this restaurant again?  Probably not.  We're lunch diners and with Wildflower Bread Co down the street, their food is so much better.",0.0,0.9984196424484252
