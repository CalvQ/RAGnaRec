There are plenty of food options, from standard fast food to sit-down restaurants. Many of the places are open pretty early. It is bright, clean, and there is plenty of seating. Bathrooms are clean and there is an attendant on duty. It can get crowded like any other airport, but security moves pretty fast.",1.0,0.9994639754295348

I found the Delta gate agents terrible - not sure if I should blame the airport or the airlines, but they were unfriendly, and aggressive with the \""you have to check this\"" attitude.  Our flight was not full, and there was easily enough room for plenty more in the overhead bins, yet they kept asking for volunteers to check their bags - and they weren't nice about it!  \nAirport bathrooms had tables with mouthwash, feminine products, and mints.  Bathrooms weren't super clean, but I thought that was a nice touch.   There weren't any attendants as Brittany L mentions, but maybe they only have them at certain times - agreed, that would be a little weird.",0.0,0.9897940158843994

Food wasn't anything special.  Like all airports, food and bottled water is overpriced and fair in quality.  I never expect much from airport food so Sky Harbor is right on par.\n\nShort term garage parking is plentiful but a little pricey.

The layout for one is ridiculous.  I felt like we spent most of our two hour layover walking from one terminal to the next just to grab a quick meal.  The saving grace was Paradise Cafe.  It was the only high quality and decently priced place to get a meal that both my child and I would like.  If you're traveling alone I'm sure you can find other places but having a kid really limits the choices!  Also they have a complete lack of power outlets!  Most airports these days have a long row of nice leather chairs with outlets in the arm, but PHX is lacking this.  You just have to hope you can get a seat by one of the columns with an outlet in it, but then you get the death stare from ten other people when you plug in!",0.0,0.99856299161911

This airport is carpeted which simply grosses me out.  In addition, there are not that many food options passed security.  I know we won't starve but there is nothing healthy and at 8 AM, very limited options for something more savory than breakfast.\n\nThe airport is also confusing.  There is no efficient way to navigate between major terminals.  To rent a car, you have to board a shuttle and ride for 20 minutes. It's obnoxious.  \n\nThe USAir check in was also a cluster with three different sections offering three different services which made it MORE confusing than it needed to be to simply check in with luggage.  Annoying.\n\nMy patience is never on point at an airport but in this case, they need to take some notes from IND.\n\nOn the upside, Wi-Fi is free (which is rare).",0.0,0.9991912245750428
