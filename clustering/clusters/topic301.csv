I don't know if this is common here, but I was shocked by it (no pun intended). He did a great job and it was very quick. I think I paid a little more for the battery itself than I would have if I had gone to Walmart or similar, but they also wouldn't have installed it (free!) at 8pm. Thanks!!!",1.0,0.9908517003059388

Came in because Honda said my battery was dying and in need of replacement. They were going to charge me $250 for a new battery. $250 sounded a BIT much for my liking, but I guess it's because I had a \""newer vehicle.\"" Also, this fee included labor (but how hard could it be to install a new battery?) Now, why would I want to pay $50 more than what Honda quoted me? The catch was that roadside assistance wouldn't replace my battery for free in the event it died. Instead, this establishment informed me that Honda made a mistake and my battery ISN'T dying, They could restore it back to factory and clean it up for ~$60. I liked that. $200 cheaper! They said it would take about an hour, so I took their offer.\n\nI'm from California, by the way. I was visiting relatives in Arizona when I realized I needed these services. LUCKILY, my car died when I made it to California and not in the middle of the desert. It actually died on my last day of college a few days later. I was devastated. Wanted to get home because I finally finished school and was graduating. I was scared and definitely couldn't afford a new battery especially when I was quoted $250. I checked autozone, sams club, costco, etc. My last resort was to call AAA. They quoted me $95 (not including tax, supposedly.) The guy got to my house, installed it, I was expecting to pay extra for LABOR and they said this was included in my AAA membership.\n\nSo my real question is... Why is this place charging for labor when supposedly it's covered by our membership? And why did I get the same exact battery/warranty for half the price? Hmmm...\n\nWasted $60 because my battery died anyway. Thanks!\n\n+2 stars because they were really nice gentlemen.",0.0,0.9991264939308168

He explained that he hooked it up and could not get the battery to hold a charge. He, of course, suggested a battery from AAA. I know it was a lie because we had the battery tested twice and the second time was the day before we took it in. I  looked at him like he was crazy because he was.
