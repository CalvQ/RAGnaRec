They had the nerve to charge for crappy bread rolls.\nOne of my friends dishes was cold in the middle and all the food was over all under seasoned.\nThe only thing that was the same was the price.

It's pretty much hidden inside the Four Seasons hotel.  I've never been to the Four Seasons for all the years I've been to Vegas.  I decided to look for a really good Sunday brunch place. After searching for an hour or so, I decided to go to Verandah.\n\nFinding parking without valet was a bit challenging at the Four Seasons.  I managed to find a huge parking lot that was south of the hotel.  I wasn't sure if it was for the Mandalay Bay beach resort or for the Four Seasons but I parked there anyways.

The place wasn't packed at all but had a decent amount of people.\n\nI seat outside, which was next to the pool area.  It was blocked off with some trees, so the patrons at the pool weren't bothersome.  After digging through the menu, I opted for the buffet brunch.  It was $40 with unlimited drinks, if you wanted Mimosas and such, you need to pay about $10 more.  \n\nAs I scoured through the food, everything looked good.  I tried almost everything and I had to say, it was good!  The scrambled eggs with salmon were perfect, not too much salt and had the perfect taste.  \n\nThe food varieties for the brunch ranged from banana pancakes, eggs benedicts to fresh made mini donuts (check the photo).
