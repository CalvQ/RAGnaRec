I am from the Netherlands, which is not too far from Spain (where everyone always goes for vacation), and have had amazing Spanish food before that the food at Firefly's does not even come close to measuring up to. \n\nThe only thing I have had that I would ever go back to eat that is completely worth it is their ribeye entree. Makes up for all the other dishes, like the flavorless paella. \n\nOther than that the restaurant is beautiful and upscale compared to the average restaurant.

Nothing to special.  Nice idea and concept, but maybe fell a tad short of the hype. It is a newer restaurant, so they should be able to get things straightened out over time.\nThe chefs working behind the cashier, very friendly.\nBrisket is a very small portion, but the Porcetta is a big tasty cut.",1.0,0.9919278621673584

Everything is edible but not particularly memorable or delicious. \n\nThe service was fine. I will have to say that of all the restaurants we visited in Vegas, which includes Gordon Ramsay Pub, Mesa Grill, Spago, DOCG and others, the server at Michael Mina Pub was the only one to refold my napkin when I left the table. The servers have been trained here.\n\nIf you find yourself at MGM with no place to eat, Michael Mina Pub would probably be fine.

This place is amazing.  From the food, to the staff to the physical space, it's perfection.  Upscale, but cozy and surprisingly reasonable for what you get.  You can tell they think about every detail, it's not just farm-to-table--it's the experience beyond the food too.  The staff is professional and many of them I recognize from years at other great restaurants.  I even love the dinnerware and their vintage fireking(?) plates.  The food is delicious and  inventive, but not intimidating  portions are generous for a restaurant of this quality.  I remember loving Underground Kitchen here, but I always left hungry and  broke.  Heritage takes reservations which is nice.    I hate waiting for tables in Madison.  I feel like I live in Madison so that I don't have to wait an hour-plus for a table.",1.0,0.9996498823165894

The waiters could barely speak English, they were a bit cold and it took forever to get their attention. So for that I took off one star. The food on the other hand was great! The portions were perfect and the prices were reasonable. After reading what was in their menu I told my husband I hope the food tastes good because if it does I'm coming back. I've been searching for the perfect breakfast spot and I feel like with Della's I've found it! It's a bit of a drive because it's in an on-strip casino but well worth it! Not only does it offer a wide variety menu but they also serve fresh pressed juices. My favorite! I had the beet juice which was very smooth and good quality. They also have different bread and biscuit baskets for a starter which I thought was different and a great idea for breakfast. My favorite thing about this restaurant is that it's big and has many tables so you never feel rushed! In Vegas I'm used to long waits and feeling rushed by servers so this experience was refreshing. I can't wait to go back! \n\nP.s. This is the perfect place to sit back and relax if you need to burn time before heading to the airport.",1.0,0.999731719493866

Garde-Manger is not consistently among top recommendations in Montreal but it makes the list often enough to form some expectations. My expectations exceeded Garde-Manger's delivery in terms of both food and overall experience. \n\nThis is another of what I call the \""Chalkboard Bistros\"", fine dining establishments that provide the menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I don't like this practice but it's popular (for now anyway). I found the menu, limited and lacking distinction / personality, with the same style of offerings that are standards around Montreal. That being said, the food was good, it just didn't deliver on the level that I would have expected given the buzz about the place. \n\nTIP; request the front bar if bar is given as an option. The back bar can become almost another kitchen-like operation preparing oysters and volume drinks. Back bar can also be pretty tight. \nTIP: avoid being seated during one of the eating sessions times 6:30 / 9:00pm, the wait-staff can get slammed during these seating sessions and your service delayed and/or intermittent.",0.0,0.9915579557418824
