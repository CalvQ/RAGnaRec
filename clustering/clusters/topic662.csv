I just took advantage of their Recession Spa package - 25 minute facial, 25 minute massage, 25 minute manacure, 25 minute pedicure , plus lunch is included- all for a weekday price of $199 (weekend prices are $250 for the package).",1.0,0.991990864276886

At first appearance, the place didn't look that great. Upon entering, it was clear that the outside appearance wasn't in deceit. There was some pop radio station playing with not so appropriate music and the front desk girl didn't seem enthusiastic or friendly at all. The front desk girl left and locked the door behind her, since the only employee left in the building would be doing my facial. The girl that did my facial wasn't friendly or pleasant either. The room for facials didn't look very clean and I was glad the lights were dimmed in order for me not to notice anything more than I already had. During the facial the girl put on some relaxing tunes, but there was a ticking clock on the wall and I could still hear the music coming from the front desk area. Then, some new employees must've entered because I heard a lot of loud banging. The facial was relaxing for the most part, but I was confused because I never received a 20 minute massage. I did get a face massage, but it was only for like 5 mins. After I was done, I decided to take a peek at the products and I was disappointed to see things I could buy at Wal-Mart and Sally's. When I went to use the restroom, it was in an area that seemed to still be under construction. I wouldn't recommend this place and I won't be going back. Needs better staff, a makeover and quality products for a start. Good parking, though. ;-)",0.0,0.999468982219696
