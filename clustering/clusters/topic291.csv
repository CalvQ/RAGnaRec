Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. \n\nIt's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices.

Cookware, prep tools, table top and linens, bakeware, lions, tigers and bears, OH MY! You name it, they got it, and decent prices! \n\nJust a few of my favorite departments to buy from: \n\n*seasonal holiday - tea towels, cake pans, sprinkles, etc in whatever holiday is coming up \n*bakeware - omg, where do I even start...loaf pans, novelty cake pans, ramekins in every size and shape imaginable... \n*prep tools - great locking tongs with silicone tips, microplane graters, perfect little lemon savers, this list could also be a novel \n*linens - napkins, placemats, tea towels (I'm not a tablecloth girl, I like to see my gorgeous wood table so just placemats for me...) \n\nFor selection and price, Sur La Table beats Williams Sonoma. If we had a Crate and Barrel I would say they are fairly even, with Sur La Table offering more unique items with more variety with similar prices. \n\nMake sure you hit up the clearance section!",1.0,0.9731990694999696

Didn't you just review Crate in Greentree?

As I stated in my Crate review, I love kitchen stores, I love creating my own vegan meals, getting creative, and relaxing in the kitchen. Sur La Table has their own line of cookware. mostly non stick aluminum. But recently they have come out with a large line of enamel coated cast iron. And the prices are well below Le Creuset. If you are a foodie like myself, this place is nirvana.\n\nIf you need a marble rolling pin this is where'd you want to start, Sur Le Table has the most fun toys, kitchen gadgets, and things you didn't know you wanted for your kitchen. I went in and came out with about half a paycheck's worth of things I didn't know I wanted. but what I went in for is what I really wanted and got a great deal. An eight quart enameled cast dutch oven, I've always wanted one. Great for lasagna, eggplant parm, roasting vegetables, and for the carnivores, you have never had pot roast until you've had it done in enameled cast cookware.\n\nI love the flavored oils, balsamic vinegars, coffees, and all the other things you'll find browsing Sur Le table.

A typical T.J. Maxx but this one had a few surprises...\n\n1. It's clean and well organized. Seriously! Departments include women's clothing, juniors clothing, men's clothing, women's shoes, handbags/luggage and homewares. \n\n2. The cooking supplies within the homewares section is especially good here. Looking for a stainless collander? How about a Le Creuset baking dish? Or a garlic press? Or a coffee machine? How about a kitschy cutting board? You may have to dig a bit, but there are definitely some gems here. \n\n3. No men's shoe section. Just something to note...\n\n4. A large sportswear section - especially for the menz. Tons o' Panther gear & Carolina goodies. Some much more appealing than others. \n\nA decent T.J. Maxx with a better than average cooking section.

Le Creuset pots, quality wooden chopping boards, etc. One cool thing that caught my eye were these coloured covers - they come in different sizes and all you do is put it over the pan and it'll seal automatically.
