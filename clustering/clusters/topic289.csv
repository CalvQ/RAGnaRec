They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.\n\nIn any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun.",1.0,0.9989405274391174

I'd been hearing people rave about this place and how it was a NY style deli. Chompie's is more NY than this place and the food is generally tastier there. I ordered a turkey sandwich on french bread with Swiss and cranberry sauce... It was okay and filled me up but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.\n\nThird: Miracle Mile dishes out pretty solid portions. It's not too much and it's not too little. To be honest, it's probably a little more toward too much... but in a good way.\n\nGo to Miracle Mile for a decent meal, just don't expect the Second Coming.",1.0,0.979289412498474

The sandwich was pretty disappointing; it was greasy (despite the fact that I ordered extra lean pastrami) and the bread didn't seem fresh or homemade. The sandwich was also not as high as I like to see my deli sandwiches, stacked only about 1/4 inch.  I have no significant complaints about their matzo ball soup, except that it was scalding hot. The final disappointment came in the form of their pickles, or rather a lack there of. One of the many reasons I lust after deli is because I live for traditional deli pickles. The pickles at Goldman's weren't good either, they seemed strangely similar to Claussen's brand, and they were pretty stingy with the pickles in the first place, we had to ask for pickles throughout the course of our meal.

Still have not found it but Archies will do in a pinch. I tried the JP Pastrami on rye with mustard and it was big and tasty. I also tried the cheese steak hoagie. The hoagie was big and well made with lettuce, onions, tomato and all but the beef was a bit chewy. Not the highest quality meat but over all a tasty sandwich that was so big I could only eat half. The cole slaw is pretty good too. I will return to try something else. Archies will be my go to deli when I'm not feeling Jason's. I'll continue to look for a deli with meats made in house and sliced thick and juicy. OK, I've made myself hungry so maybe another trip to Archies is in order.

Sorry Smallman Street Deli, but you've just been replaced! Everything (except the cheese I was told) is made on location, which is completely obvious when you bite into the freshest mix of bread/slaw/meat, etc. I ordered the equivalent of the turkey Rachel, and it was delicious! We also ordered the dessert pierogies w/ sweet potato and pumpkin filling and ice cream. I convinced my husband I might have a bite and then probably took out 2/3 of it because it was that good!\n\nTo sum it up: it's amazing food, all worth the price in a tiny deli with little seating but at least a cozy atmosphere.

The Caprese sandwich was just as good.  It has mozz cheese, basil, balsamic, and tomato and I added the Duck Prosuitto that was wonderful.  All on a fresh baguette. \n\nThere are teas and some Red Ribbon(?) sodas available.  Never heard of the soda brand and did not try it.  Next time.\n\nThis is a great place for lunch or dinner but is only open Monday thru Thursday 10 to 7.  If you are in the South Hills, just pop on up from Banksville or West Liberty and have a great soup and sandwich or take some fresh meats and cheeses home.\n\nCDC is at the Pittsburgh Public Market on Weekends, guess that is why the store is only open Monday thru Thursday.",1.0,0.998483955860138

The chicken was seasoned very nicely, not like many places do.\n\nThe Turkey and Gouda sandwich was also very solid, but not quite worth the $10 price tag.\n\nThe thing that stops this place from being 5-stars however is the slow delivery of the food at lunch time.  There was no one else in the deli at the time, and my food took longer than it should have.  If this places was busy, I'd really be worried about how long you might wait.
