Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule.\n\nI look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. \n\nI have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care.",1.0,0.9994686245918274

His treatment space is clean, quiet. Dr. Warner  is pleasant, respectful and very rofessional. I wish I could give him 6 stars.\n\nDr. Warner observes an obvious  knowledge of advanced anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and chiropractic. \n\nHe is strong and gives great adjustments, utilizing a soft tissue technique called Trigger Point Therapy prior to adjusting. He knows how to \""melt knots\"" and find those troubled spots. It's obvious that he enjoys teaching when going over the symptoms, what he's doing, why he's doing it,, and what you can expect both during the session, and afterward.\n\nHe is intuitive, which is very important in someone who is a bodywork healthcare professional.  It's obvious that he is educated well in his craft. He is compassionate and a fantastic listener and gets down to the nitty gritty. The best part is he genuinely wants to find the root of the problem and fix it. \n\nDr Warner is hands down my top choice for chiropractic care in Phoenix. What I really like about Dr. Warner is he  prioritizes patient healing and independence, and his treatment plans are effective and efficient.  You will not spend years going to his office three times per week, because he truly wants to see his patients get better and go on to do all the things they love to do.  To this end, Dr. Warner offers exercises, stretches and other lifestyle modifications to his patients so they can continue their healing outside of his office.\n\nI highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a fantastic chiropractor.  I wouldn't consider going to any other chiropractor.",1.0,0.999262273311615

I looked up the chiropractors with the highest reviews because I wanted the best. The first one I went to told me that the minimum I would have to see her is for 3x a week for a month, maybe longer, but she wouldn't know until seeing my x-rays. She was nice and explained how the spine works, but how could she know how long I would need treatment without thoroughly examining me? So to get another opinion, I went to another highly rated chiropractor, but the office was closed. Third time is a charm, as Dr. Reiss was able to see me very quickly, and I got a great deal on a comprehensive exam. After examining my back with some state-of-the-art equipment (no x-rays), he was able to find my trouble spot and went on to explain how my sitting and standing played a big role in the trouble I was having. He gave me a much needed adjustment and provided me with exercises I could do to keep my back strong. That was it... one adjustment and following his advice, and that problem pain that lasted so long was gone just like that! No weekly treatments, just one great experience! Thank you Dr. Reiss for your honesty and integrity. We Las Vegans are very lucky to have you here!",1.0,0.987458348274231

She also takes the time needed with each patient. For example, last week I had a simple question about my posture and she showed me stretches I can use to improve it (I guess I sit in front of a computer too much!) I was impressed that she took the time to physically show me the different stretches/exercises and explain to me why my shoulders were rolling in. My last chiropractor would just do the same few adjustments and move on to the next patient. This is not the case with Dr. Bobbie - she shows how much she cares with every visit.\n\nI feel so lucky to have Dr. Bobbie as my Chiropractor and have recommended her to several friends that are still also seeing her.\n\nAs the other reviewer stated, the office is lovely - if you leave a message, they respond immediately when they get to the office. They make it fast and easy to \""squeeze\"" in a visit if needed and the office hours are very balanced so that you are easily able to make an appointment and get in. She also runs on time with her appointments - so it's nice when I run over on an office break to get adjusted that I know what to expect. \n\nI will continue to see Dr. Bobbie Bennett - I realize how much my life balance has improved from getting adjusted by this outstanding, professional chiropractor.",1.0,0.9988378882408142

Talk about serendipity!  This guy is the BEST Chiropractor I've ever used!\nWhen I walked in there I was walking in severe pain from old auto accidents, stress and a multitude of sins I just let go until I got to the breaking point meaning I couldn't stand more than about 10 minutes at most and walking had become super painful and slow.  My hips were twisted again from an old motorcycle accident which throws off everything it seems, and--because of some previously painful and questionable work done by a Chiro in Illinois--I never went back to one when I came to Arizona.\nMy regular Phoenix Physician wanted to send me to a Pain Management Dr. so he could what?  Mask the pain I guess which seemed awfully stupid to me, so I bit the bullet and started looking for a local Chiro here.  I'm so glad I did, too...and soooo glad I found Dr. Rick especially.\nSince my experiences with two other old time Chiros in llinois used old school techniques I went in there kinda scared:  you know what I mean with the twisting of the neck and the cracking and all.  I was always sure I was going to end up a paraplegic.  They were rough, their treatments didn't last all that long and they didn't suggest any after-care or exercises--just come see me again when you can't walk without pain.  Kinda discouraging really.\nDr. Rick uses new techniques which I had never experienced before which are much more gentle (and a heckofalot less scary) but get the job done.  He will suggest exercises and after-care if needed.  He WILL take care of you because he really CARES about his patients (you can tell it), he loves his work (again, you can tell it) and he will listen carefully to what you tell him throughout your appointment and will answer any questions about your care that you have.  \nHe's very professional, and seems to have absolutely no problem in educating his patients on what he is doing and why.  Frankly, I never had a Chiro do that before and I really appreciate it.  He even makes his cell phone number accessible and encourages you to call him with any questions you might have after you leave there...can you imagine that one?\nVery low rates and excellent service.  I cannot give any more stars to this Chiropractor, but, if I could, I would,  I am extremely happy with his work and am getting my friends to go to him, too.  He's making me well, and I'm so very grateful for his skill, knowledge and caring...thanks for enabling me to live sans pain, Dr. Rick!

I returned so he could go over the MRI and make his diagnoses and treatment.  He was a fast talker and then started to pitch.  I have been in sales for a long time.  I have been taught some great techniques over the years after countless training.  I saw right through his pitch, which was well executed.  Then came the treatment cost.  What a waste of time, They wanted me to be there 3 times a week for about 6 weeks and it was going to cost $3,000.00!  I thanked the doctor with my head still spinning and walked out the door.  \n\nSo the moral of the story is,  Do you have bunch of money that you don't know what to do with?
