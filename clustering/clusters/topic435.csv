Great prices, great service, great music.  I came from way out of town for an act that I couldn't pass up: the Corb Lund Band.  Canadian Honky-Tonk at its finest!  \n\nWhat I like most was the vibes - this place has character.  You can tell the building is old, but from what it looks like, it is in great condition.  The mood lighting is red and dim and the decor has a 60s retro-modern twist.  I like it.  If it's open, try to grab a seat on the upstairs balcony, especially if seats are limited down below.  The view and sound is fantastic.\n\nTicket prices are right on the mark - most shows that I saw are under $20, most well below that.  Corb was $15, and from the performance we got, I'd say it was well worth it.  What also blew me away was the drink prices, I got an above rail whiskey mixer for under $5.  Maybe I'm not used to small town prices, but this was an unexpected surprise.\n\nAll towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like The Highdive.  I have to agree with Jess S. on her review; there are not many places like this in the Midwest, and surely not in Indy.  Keep booking the gigs, Highdive, I'll keep ordering Wild Turkey and Ginger Ales.",1.0,0.997170388698578

Secondly, when it's packed, you will often find rude pricks who don't understand (or don't give a sh*t about) your personal space.

Hell, I hadn't anticipated food, period, given it was a music venue). But of course the food would be great, considering the kitchen is overseen by Chris Bianco, who is responsible for the masterpiece that is Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nCan't say enough good stuff about this place!!!",1.0,0.9974111914634703

When you first go if your not really into EDM mainly dubstep and drum and bass you might get a little freaked out by the crowd it attracts. BUT I liked the music the local under ground artist were very entertaining and I had great time. \n\nVenue: 2/5 The Venue is small I was a little concerned because even though the bouncer at the door checked every ones ID's some people looked a little too young to be there. Like I said the venue is small kind of run down a bit could use a little work. The carpet looked dark and dirty like It hasn't been washed in forever.\n\nPrice: 2/5 The drinks were way to over priced for a place like this. it was $19 for a crown and coke (in a rather small cup) and a corona. For a place like this I'd expect cheaper beers and cheaper mixed drinks but they charged prices just like the bigger Las Vegas clubs. I was definitely not expecting that.",0.0,0.9009810090065002

When Crescent Ballroom opened up, I heard great things.  I finally had the opportunity to see a show there.\n\nMy first impression was great.  There is seating in the back if you need to rest, the place is intimate, the acoustics seemed good... In fact, it was great until people started showing up.\n\nThe problem with Crescent is the scene.  If you want to hang out and chat (loudly) with a bunch of hipsters, it's probably the place for you.  If, however, you are there to actually listen to a live band, good luck hearing the slow songs over all the chatter.\n\nThe parking situation is also pretty annoying.  You really do need exact change, and there's no other obvious place to park nearby with an actual parking attendant.\n\nIn all fairness, it's really a decent little venue.  The live music is just unfortunately secondary to the social scene.",0.0,0.6083908081054688
