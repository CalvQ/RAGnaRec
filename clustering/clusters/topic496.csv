This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in \""Karate Kid\"", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.\n\nThat being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.  I am confident in his abilities.\n\nThe dojo is restructuring, and growing, and all for the better.  It has the best workshops, training clinics, guest speakers, and REAL tournament training by far.  I couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional, traditional Japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction.",1.0,0.9989583492279052

I moved to Las Vegas about two years ago and training at Cobra Kai has become a major party of my life out here.  \n\nThe Jiu Jitsu training here is top notch, led by Sim Go, who himself has proven his expertise in competition.  But just as important, if not more important, Sim has proven his ability to pass on his knowledge and skills, as his students have consistently dominated the local grappling circuit at tournaments like NAGA and Grapplers Quest, among many others.  In addition, Cobra Kai has performed well at local amateur mma competitions like Tuff N Uff and has its share of successful professional fighters.\n\nAside from Jiu Jitsu, you can find pretty much everything you need to succeed -- Strength & Conditioning, Wrestling, Boxing and Muay Thai/Kickboxing -- all led by great coaches with proven expertise as well.  \n\nThis is the kind of gym where you will almost instantaneously feel like you're part of a team... a family.  A place where the teachers know your name and cater towards your particular needs to achieve your goal.  \n\nFrom the teachers, to the students... to Sam (Sim's father), Jenn (lady at the front desk) and the parents who cheer on their children...

I've trained and competed all over the world and Sergio Penha is the best guy I have ever been on the mat with. He is a true legend and pioneer of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) who has been training for 40 years now. \n\nSergio trains everyone from students with no martial arts experience to professional athletes at the highest level of their sport. The best thing about Sergio Penha BJJ is the family atmosphere. There are no ego's at his gym and everyone helps everyone to be the best they can be. Sergio teaches a unique blend of BJJ that can be used for everyday self defense, brazilian jiu jitsu competitions or even professional mixed martial arts style competition. \n\nI've seen examples first hand of Sergio helping to change peoples lives. I've seen it in many forms. Some people gain confidence they never had before in everyday life, others get in the best shape of their lives and others achieve their dreams of competing as a professional athlete. Sergios school is based on 3 principles: Loyalty, Family, Respect.\n\nLike I said earlier, I have trained in every style of martial art in my journey and there is no doubt that Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the single best art you and your family can do for self defense purposes in todays world. It is a very effective approach using technique, leverage and intelligence to defeat larger stronger opponents. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu also uses the gi which is a martial arts uniform that mimics clothes a person would wear in everyday life. You wear a top with a collar, you have pants and you have a belt. All of these translate to self defense in real life as your attacker would 99.9% of the time be wearing clothes (at least lets hope). Do yourself a favor and check it out now for a free week. Sergios gym offers adult classes, kids classes and now a new womens self defense class. Chances are I will see you guys there! \n\nSergioPenha.com",1.0,0.99893456697464

All ages train there, from 4-55. I immediately felt welcome, even coming in with a black belt from another studio. By the way this is no belt factory, everyone earns their belts there. If you would like to better anything in your life i would give this studio the highest recommendation. The equipment is all great and up to date. The students respect their do jang and it is very clean. Nice big mat area, warm up area, seating for visitors, bathrooms, they even have a full fridge for Gatorade lol.

So I checked the instructor's website http://phoenixjkd.com/ and read it thoroughly. \n\nThe instructor, Sharam, lists his lineage (he is a third generation instructor) there so I actually called his instructor to confirm. Everything checked out. Then I decided to simply take advantage of the trial period. I asked Sharam a slew of very direct questions to which all of his answers met or exceeded my expectations. His teaching methods during that trial, and ever since, have shown him to be an excellent teacher. Everything is broken down to a simple teaching so the newest person in the room can grasp the information. \n\nEverything we have learned in just one short month has blown away everything I have ever learned. I used to hold my own sparring with black belts and I learned combat fighting serving 8 years in the Marine Corps yet I feel like I did not know how to REALLY fight.

Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. \n\nIf you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train.",1.0,0.9937461614608764
