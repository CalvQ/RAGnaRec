However, when she arrived to pick them up later that week, they read the email as she wanted a dozen EACH of the flavors she listed!

At the potluck the subject of cupcakes in general came up, in particular how popular they have become. this is news to me, but i guess it's super cool and trendy (esp. in NY) to have a cupcake specialty store. i mentioned that was funny bc my best friend had just decided to have cupcakes instead of  a wedding cake simply because she loves them so much. ... so, in her hunt for the bakery to provide the special cakes for her big day, she tried three or four bakeries that she just hated. she reported: most were owned by barbie blonde \""i-married-for-money-but-i-suck-at-designing-handbags-so-ill-open-a-bakery\"" women who's product, for lack of a better word, sucks. she was blown away with how much they were charging and how gross the cupcakes were! also, they charged her to sample their cakes (odd, when your'e faced with a potentially huge sale, not to mention exposure by doing a wedding). \nanyway, she just about lost hope by the time she went to Wicked. i swear these are her words that the owner was the coolest, nicest, most helpful person. some interesting things she noted: for special occassions like weddings, they come and set up their product (the other bakeries would not, you just have to come pick them up and do it yourself - not really something you want to add to your \""to do\"" list on your wedding day, people) and when she questioned whether the frosting would hold up to the late May heat - he assured her that they will have switched to their *summer recipe* for frosting, which is lighter and will not turn to mush before they can be gobbled up. \n\nnow that, my friends, is impressive. i need an excuse to buy cupcakes now for myself....",0.0,0.9829609990119934

I thought this sounded like a great place for cupcakes based on the reviews.  However, I'm into real food, not fake tastes.  These are definitely better cupcakes than your store-bought mix and frosting.  However, I am not into vegetable oil in cake batter and frosting.  \n\nTo their credit, the cupcakes weren't disgustingly sweet to my tastes.  The carrot cupcake I tried had some good flavors, as did the German chocolate one.  I wasn't a fan of the fluffy, air-whipped frosting on the carrot cupcake and thought it lacked real cream cheese flavor.  I make some pretty good cupcakes at home, and I use good-quality butter and other ingredients.  While Lulu's cake texture is decent, and the flavors are almost there, some of the tastes are less than authentic to my sensitive palate.  I'll stick to making my own.\n\nThe store offers some chairs for sitting.  It's an OK place to hang out and read for a bit, if you don't mind the surrounding strip-mall ambience.  However, I didn't notice an especially worthwhile selection of beverages.  I had a hot peppermint \""tea,\"" and I saw some insulated coffee carafes behind the counter.  I am picky about coffee, though (beans, roasting, & how it's prepared), and I can't imagine that their coffee quality would be very good.  The focus is on cupcakes, not drinks - I get it - but what a shame, since tables and chairs are provided.  Still, I just don't understand taking shortcuts with the main product.\n\nOther than the flavor, the cupcakes are lovely, and the place is decorated adorably.

They're still five-star cupcakes.\n\nI am really picky about my cupcakes, especially since I moved to Arizona and realized that Phoenix-area cupcake bakeries are trying to subdue all their customers through sugar comas.

Moderate (to low) prices.\n\nI love the people I've met who work there (Dan, and a lovely short-haired lady whose name I didn't catch today). \n\nI love these cupcakes. I've tried their pumpkin spice (November special), carrot cake (several times), banana, brown velvet, and raspberry pistachio (December special). I'm a cream-cheese lover, so I haven't strayed much from cupcakes with icing containing cream cheese or mascarpone. Don't need to. They're that good.\n\nBelieve it or not, the simple brown velvet is my favorite. Their chocolate cake is mind-bogglingly good. It's moist, delicately chocolatey, has a nice, fine crumb, and also holds together while eating. It's basically everything a chocolate cupcake should be. Let me rephrase. It's everything a chocolate cupcake should be. The swirl of cream cheese icing on top is the right size, shape, and quantity to match the cupcake.\n\nGive 'em a try for sure. While a lot of the Food Network places have some undeserved fame, Ollie Cakes deserves every praise that could be lavished upon it.

The best cupcake I've ever had was a \""Mexican Hot Chocolate\"" that had a spicy kick in the rich chocolate frosting.  They didn't make it again this year, sadly.\n\nUnfortunately, I've also had a few dry cupcakes (a sweet potato with marshmallow topping cupcake for example), and they can be a tad on the small side for what they cost.  When they're dry you think \""Oh, that wasn't really worth $3.\""\n\nThe cookies have always been very moist and delicious though!  Yes, they're still a little pricey for single (large) cookies, but buying when they have their 50% off sale helps address that.  The winter cookie specials (chocolate peppermint, ginger molasses as a gingerbread man or drop cookie with turbinado sugar, and a sugar star with white chocolate frosting) were excellent this year.\n\nThe brownies are ridiculously rich and decadent!  Definitely fudgey and not cakey. I'm not a mocha fan but I actually like the richness the espresso brings to them.\n\nParking is extremely convenient compared to similar bakeries (park behind the fence, against the adjacent building, there's signage), and I've never seen it too crowded either.\n\nDon't forget to download the Belly app to get free reward points with every visit!",1.0,0.9967799782752992

I had the all chocolate cupcake with chocolate mousse, dipped in chocolate.  SO GOOD!  \n\nThis time around, I went to the store since its down the street from my parents' house and wanted to get a dozen cupcakes for my grandma's 92nd birthday.  I had browsed the website and saw what types of flavors they had, and called the bakery to request some be put on hold until I drove in from LA.  The lady who had answered the phone told me that I did not need to call in and reserve any cupcakes because they would have them there all day and since I was ordering a variety, there should definitely be some in stock.  BAD NEWS, I had my heart set on the all chocolate cupcake, the peanut butter and chocolate, and the mint and chocolate, and NONE were available.   Maybe it was the day of the week, but there were no chocolate cake cupcakes available other than the cookies and cream cupcake.  Ended up settling with a few red velvet, peach, strawberry, cookies and cream and carrot cupcakes.  Read from the past yelp reviews about the cookie offer, so I snagged a couple of those to help ease the disappointment.  At least the cookies were good and a couple of the ones we had chosen were dipped in chocolate.  And to add insult to injury, my mom tried the cookies and cream cupcake, and said the chocolate cake part was dry.

Moist cupcakes=YUM, but the moistness of these cupcakes was very uncommon. I'd like to know how they make the cupcakes so moist... I hope it's a combination of baking technique and natural ingredients, and aren't pumping these babies with chemicals. \n\nMad About Strawberry- Entirely strawberry, with strawberry flavored caupe, filling, and frosting. NOT good, and that takes a lot for me to say about a cupcake! The cake itself was unidentifiable and had no taste of strawberry... or vanilla, or anything for that matter. The frosting was so artificial tasting and sickeningly sweet that it was the only cupcake I didn't finish on the entire tour. I do NOT recommend getting this cupcake. \n\nMad About Mocha- Coffee base with chocolate ganache filling and java bean frosting. This one was better, but still extremely artificial tasting. \n\nIsland Joy- This was my favorite cupcake at Mad Hatter. It tasted just like an Almond Joy candy bar. Coconut base with chocolate ganache filling and coconut frosting. The frosting was great. I'd buy a round of coconut frosting shots for everyone! \n\nAll in all, this place is way overpriced. If the quality of the product was combined with the customization, then MAYBE they'd be able to get away with $3. However, every cupcake on our tour was better than these, and less expensive. If you are in the area and want cupcakes, skip the Mad Hatter and go down the street to Cupcake Lane.",0.0,0.995744526386261

Well, I realized why I hadn't been there in so long after I are my first cupcake.\nI ordered 1/2 dozen cupcakes for $15, which in comparison to similar shops is pretty reasonable. However, my cupcakes just were subpar, probably why they were only $15. I got two strawberry cupcakes with vanilla frosting, two pumpkin cupcakes, and one chocolate with peanut butter frosting, and one chocolate with banana frosting. \nThe first cupcakes my friend and I ate were the strawberry ones. Immediately we both noticed that the cupcake had no strawberry taste what so ever, but did have a lot of pink food dye, which made the texture of the cupcake kind of iffy. After we took our first bite we immediately went and scraped about half of the frosting off, as there was just so much frosting, which tastes like an amateur buttercream, way too much powdered sugar! The frosting was completely way too much, too sweet, not a good frosting just in general because there was too much sugar. I love sweets, and I have a major sweet tooth, but it was just a lot of frosting that wasn't even good frosting.\nWe later decided to try to split the chocolate peanut butter cupcake, and again, the cake was moist, but had a very dense texture, and tasted like any generic store bought cupcake mix. If I'm paying good money for cupcakes, make it so they don't taste store bought. I could go to the store and buy a box of cake mix and a can of frosting and get a better outcome. \nThe only reason I gave a review of two stars instead of one is that 1) they have pumpkin cupcakes even though it's not fall, and 2) I like that you can mix and match different frostings, fillings, cakes, and toppings so they're made to order. I think that's a pretty cool concept.\nIndividual cupcakes are $2.99/each, which is steep considering other shops do cupcakes for $2.50/$2.75 for better quality cakes. If you want an awesome cupcake try Showboy Bake Shop, the Cupcakery, or Freeds. Those are the best cupcakes in town, hands down! This shop, just disappointing.",0.0,0.9982643723487854

And you know what?  There's just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided America's class system has become than a trip to Sprinkle's.  \n\nA friend from Cali just had to go here and so I was brought along.  I watched with a mixture of amusement and anger as silicone-stuffed Scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over $3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.  I wondered, \""what sort of moron pays $36 for 12 cupcakes?\""  I'll answer that question for you: someone with more money than intellect.  My friend insisted I couldn't judge their decisions until I purchased one myself.  I grudgingly forked over my $3.25 for a Dark Chocolate cupcake.\n\nWith near Willy Wonka-esque inefficiency, the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.  I can't imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.  I'm sure part of the $3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.\n\nOn to the cupcake itself.  It was good.  Not great, but good.  I'll make no excuses; it tasted nice.  The cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.  It tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.  With that said, my mother would never have spent $3.25 on a cupcake.  I have no problem with paying more for considerably better food or expertise in preparation.  But you can't tell me that there's a rocket science to making cupcakes.  This is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.  How is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare, the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupcakes?  \n\nMy advice: do something better with your money.  You'll weigh less and feel better.  And if you want a cupcake, go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.  Cupcakes are not exactly tough to make.  And with the $30 or so you have left, buy some food for your local shelter or food pantry.",0.0,0.9905780553817748

These are unlike any cupcake I ever had... as if the cake was baked by the Hindu Goddess Annapurna and the icing was made from unicorn tears. \n\nAs one would imagine, its pricey to have a goddess create food that could inspire a symphony...

I've had some good cupcakes in my time. Sprinkles isn't on that list.  See I think that Sprinkles, as a company, doesn't really like cupcakes. I think they like the fact that they can bank on a fad. Their shop is very scene-y, which is the antithesis of the happy cupcake times I want to experience. Its the kind of place an anoerexic would go and gaze fondly at the cupcakes and then leave not having eaten anything. \n\nI went in and was immediately greeted by multiple employees, and was explained their rotating cupcake stocking system and told that their red velvet cupcakes were the most popular. I asked them if they used real beets to color the chocolate cake...they just gaped at me, then each other. Finally someone came up with \""...noo, we use red food coloring.\"" well thrilling. FYI European studies are consistently showing that a number of red food dyes interact with children's endocrine systems causing migraines and ADHD symptoms and Red #3 has even caused tumors in mice! \n\nAnyway the magic of red velvet is the earthy play the beets offer, not just the color so I skipped that and when for Lemon Ginger. $3.51 is $3.51, but this better be a really good cupcake. Here we go: the frosting has the only flavor...lemon extract that is. It is sweet the way I like my frosting but a little crunchy and crystallized from sitting out all day. The cake was like moist cardboard. I mean that in the best way of course - the cake was fine but had zero taste. That was where I was expecting the ginger kick. When I finished it I realized that I was expecting ginger the root, when the real goal was the ginger flavor of boxed cakes which are two totally different worlds. \n\nIn the end I want a cupcake that tastes like someone made it with love...not necessarily love for ME, but love for cupcakes in general.

Let me first start with the location.  It's very stupid.  Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don't need \""personality\"" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can't subtract stars for this, it doesn't make sense.\n\nAs for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn't.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.\n\nThe peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it's texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.\n\nSprinkles, I will not be back.  I don't like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.",0.0,0.9948439598083496

While they're ultimately VERY tasty and definitely the best cupcakes I've ever had, I still find myself thinking, \""I'm paying that much for six cupcakes? Really?\"" I've been eating they're cupcakes since a few years back when I lived in LA and these were the new \""in\"" thing in Beverly Hills. It's no surprise that their first move out of CA was to Scottsdale and besides In-N-Out, it's one of the best imported franchises they have to offer.\n\nTo be honest, as far as flavors go, you can't really go wrong with anything you pick here. They're super rich, so really think about if you want just two or a dozen. It makes sense as to why they give you a fork a knife to eat these things.\n\nWhen it really boils down to it, Sprinkles is a guilty pleasure. By picking up an order here and enjoying it, you feel like you should be at a party with the kind of people that dress their chihuahuas in juicy couture hoodies and drink only beverages that some how include hand picked wheat grass from Bali.

I live in South Chandler, and luckily go to school at ASU, so the drive up Scottsdale Road after class wasn't killer out of the way. The line was out the door and there were very few varieties left even though there were still at least 3 more business hours left for the day. I had my heart set on a lemon cupcake, but they claimed they didn't have any left for the day (a tray was set out as I was leaving the shop!!!) I picked up 13, 12 for sharing, and one for the car ride home. The price was certainly exorbant, $42 for 13 cupcakes made my head spin, but it was happily charged to my credit card, thinking about how tasty these cupcakes were going to be... \n\nI had a coconut cupcake for 30 mile ride home. The cake was dry. The frosting was tasty, but extremely sugary with the sweetened coconut on top. There wasn't a cream cheese tang to the frosting that usually comes with good coconut cupcakes. It tasted like regular buttercream to me. I was let down. But I had 4 other varieties to try when I got home...\n\nIt was the same story with the other cupcakes (Red Velvet, Black and White, Vanilla, and Vanilla Milk Chocolate). The cake was dry (I highly doubt these were made that week!) and crumbly, and the frosting just didn't seem right. The Red Velvet didn't have the cream cheese tang, just like the coconut. The Vanilla/Vanilla Milk Chocolate cakes were the worst. They didn't hold up to a knife at all! The Black and White was the most moist out of the five varieties I tried, but the chocolate flavor in the cake seemed almost burnt.\n\nI thought maybe these were maybe opening day/week flubs, but the consistancy has stayed the same. I've been back two more times, hoping that maybe they've worked it out, but they really haven't! And somehow, they've been out of the fruit flavor I had planned on getting each time I've been there!\n\nI was really disappointed in these cupcakes, especially for the price. I can whip up a batch of 2 dozen frosted homemade cupcakes for less than 2 of Sprinkles' Cupcakes. I should have known not to get caught up in the hype.

I don't love the price :(  Of the dozen I chose, my faves were the Strawberry Creme, Coconut, Red Velvet, Dark Dark Chocolate (w/ and w/out sprinkles!), and the ultimate, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip!\n\nThe strawberry tasted like real strawberries!  Not just strawberry flavor.  I could taste strawberries in the icing AND the cake.  Amazing!  The Red Velvet was just the best version of this variety I've ever tried... So moist...  Same goes w/ the Dark Dark Chocolate... the ultimate devil's food cupcake!  Wish I could have a spoonful of that dark chocolate ganache frosting right now!  As for the Coconut and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, I'd cry if I had to choose only one...  The Coconut had such rich flavor of coconut in the frosting, and I really enjoyed the fresh-tasting and non-greasy feel of the coconut flakes that topped the lemon-scented vanilla cake below.  Mmm!!  The best, for me, though were the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cupcakes!  The bakers at Sprinkles got the essence of peanut butter here exquisitely.  Combined w/ high-quality chocolate chips, I could not NOT eat just half of a cupcake, or even just ONE cupcake!  I don't know where I found the restraint to do so, but I was able to save the second piece for a rehash of all that peanutty-chocolate greatness fifteen minutes later :)  [Fifteen minutes, fifteen seconds; half of one, two quarters of another... LOL]\n\nTwo stars docked for the high cost of each cupcake; how I was rushed to make my selections; and even with the specialized box packaging, some of the cakes jumbled around and their frostings' muddled and not picture-perfect.  A coworker had brought to work the day before what she claimed were homemade extra-large cupcakes in a box that was large and deep enough to securely house and present the cupcakes beautifully.  (I say \""claimed\"" bec. I recognized the sugar dot candies that topped her XL cupcakes to be Sprinkles' logo. Now I know where she got them... they're leftovers from Sprinkles' cupcake mixes!  Now, I wonder where she procured that specially-designed box?  Maybe I should get her people and Sprinkles' to talk to each other...)  She even had silver and gold dusting on the frosting; None of the Sprinkles' selections I bought had glitter.  I feel that safe transport and great presentation from bakery to table should also be taken in account for what Sprinkles (and other gourmet bakeries) charge their customers to pay for their products.

So I'll get his opinion of the cupcake. I'm willing to bet he'll like it! \n\nSo 5 Stars for the GCC at Sprinkles!! \n\nHOWEVER part of me wants to give them a big fat 1 (0 if I could give a 0)star rating, because I found out that GCC is a temporary for January.

When I walked in there was a line about 30 people deep. I was like OK have these people never had a cupcake before? Anyways, I walk in and I couldn't tell if I was in a pseudo bakery or a fashion show/salon setting? Nothing about this place reflects a bakery. So I ordered a red velvet cupcake and I guess waitress you would call it wrote up a ticket for it. OK, it is one cupcake, apparently the ticket is for tracking product, I don't know. Then I had to wait at least a solid 3 minutes before they gave it to me. I had the cash in my hand. Can't it be a grab and go? Apparently no!! \nAs for the cupcake itself, the structural integrity was totaled f*cked. It was so top heavy that the top was breaking off from the bottom. It was obvious that it wasn't freshly frosted because the frosting had the hard crust, like it was a done a day before and sat on a shelf for numerous hours. But I will say that the cream cheese frosting did taste good. As far as the cake, the taste was pleasant. Light and airy cake. Overall the cupcake was pretty darn good. \nWith all that being said I'm glad I tried one. Would I wait in line for 15 minutes again? Not unless I had an undying insatiable craze for one, which I don't see happening. Yes it is better than any supermarket cupcake that I have ever had, but I'm more than happy getting a Hostess cupcake at any convenience store for cheap than paying $3.81 for one single cupcake.

The cake is always moist and the frosting delicious. I have had cupcakes from other bakeries where they pipe the frosting on using a pastry bag, and there is wayyyyyy too much frosting. Sprinkles does it by hand, so the frosting amount is always perfect for the cake size. I love the simple decorations they use as well.\n\nThe only downside I have noticed is that they use a lot of oil, and if the cupcake is touching the box the oil will actually seep through the cardboard. But I guess it's the price you pay for extremely moist cupcakes! Also, the frosting is super sweet and it sometimes makes my teeth hurt. It's so worth it though!\n\nMy favorite flavor ever is Chai Latte! They only have them on Fridays though, and they often run out before dinner, so get there early if you want one!\n\nThey also have amazing seasonal flavors: salty caramel, dark chocolate raspberry, eggnog spice, chocolate peppermint, and the best: brown sugar praline! That one is an Easter flavor and I love the crunch of the praline combined with the brown sugar! YUM!\n\nYes, it is a bit pricey, but if you like the \""Sprinkles Cupcakes\"" and \""Sprinkles Cupcakes Scottsdale\"" Facebook pages they each do a daily whisper word that will get the first 50 people a free cupcake!

However, I really can't justify spending $14.00 for (4) cupcakes.  They are expensive so they can pay their overhead and lease costs, not because of exotic ingredients or special decorating skills.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they use good ingredients, but the wrappers are plain, there's no special piping or fondant work, and the flavors are standard. They are just plain good cupcakes...not fantastic, but good.  Certainly not worth $3.50 a cupcake.  I do a ton of baking and I get special order requests from friends and neighbors all the time.

Ive been wanting to try the cupcakes here for quite some time now and was uber excited when I finally got here. The place is small and have no tables for you to sit,chill, and eat..so it's more of a takeout place. My bf and I got here around 2 so this will probably explain why th cupcakes were dry? Anyway, I got the vanilla with regular icing and my bf got the chocolate with peanut butter icing and choc ganache center. I guess mine wasn't as dry as my bf's cupcake but I never thought I'd miss smiths cupcakes...yes ive had better. The choc/peanut butter on the other hand was just dry. The choc ganache did not help with the dryness either. It was thick and too rich so the combo of dryness and thickness made us want more and more water like no tomorrow. By the time we were finish we were both making weird hacking noises because it felt like there was a piece of cake stuck in our throats.\n\n So i guess if you're planning on coming here do bring plenty of water and at least 4 bucks for one cupcake. Coming in earlier would probably help as well. I do believe in second chances so I am planning on coming back to give it another shot.",0.0,0.9976266026496888

And I love pumpkin!  I just peeled off the frosting and ate the cake.  Pretty disappointing.\n\n2. Milk & Cookies\nChocolate-chip cake topped with vanilla buttercream and a freshly baked chocolate-chip cookie.\n- I didn't like the fact that when I took the cookie off the top, all of the buttercream came with it.  But the cake part was delicious and surprisingly, the cookie kinda tasted salty.\n\n3. Hopscotch\nVanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache\n- I'm not really a butterscotch fan, but this was ok.  The cake was really moist!\n\n4. Salted Caramel Crunch\nChocolate cake topped with caramel buttercream sprinkled with sea salt and topped with a chocolate covered pretzel\n- I thought the chocolate cake was a little dry.  But the caramel buttercream and chocolate covered pretzel were delish!\n\n5. Coffee & Donuts\nVanilla cake covered in donut glaze and topped with a dollop of coffee buttercream.  Husband said that it was good.\n\n6. Apple Cider\nCinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream dusted with cinnamon and sugar\n- The cake part reminded me of a coffee cake and was really good!  The buttercream definitely had that apple & cider flavor.  Truthfully, I ate most of the cake part without the frosting.\n\n7. Toasted Coconut\nToasted coconut cake topped with vanilla bean buttercream, toasted coconut, and sweetened condensed milk\n- I didn't see or taste the condensed milk but if you love coconut, you'll love this cupcake.  Coconut all the way!\n\nWe really wanted to try the cinnamon toast, but were told that the spicy pumpkin took the place of it?\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed the unique flavor combinations of the cupcakes, but being that its at least a 30 minute drive from my house, not sure that I would drive the 30 minutes just for a cupcake.\n\nThe other reason I wanted to try them- I am looking for a dessert place for my office holiday party.  $29 for 12 cupcakes is a little steep.

One is each individual cupcake is around $2.50. So for a dozen you gotta shell out around 30 bucks. If you were planning on having a decent size birthday party for your kid and cupcakes are the option, you can easily spend almost a hundred bucks for 36 of them. The other reason is that their location is kind of in the boonies. So you gotta actually PLAN a time to go there.\n\nOverall, I wanted to be fair so I think 3 is appropriate.

It wasn't my personal taste so I asked her what customers favorite was, again it was the hopscotch.

So I got to my car being the fatty that I am wanted to eat one right away. They were both in an individual bag and I picked the cherry cheesecake cupcake. The cake was super moist and cherry flavored, complete with actual cherries. The cake itself was good. Now, I love frosting! But this frosting missed the mark entirely.  It was way too sweet, it didn't have any discernible cheesecake flavor to it and it was dry! It had a very unpleasant, hey, I have been sitting in this display case for hours crust on it.  I didn't even want to finish the cupcake. The frosting just killed it. \n\nI figured I'd have better luck with the banana cupcake. It tasted like banana but bread without nuts. It was moist and had good flavor, but again the frosting was way too sweet! And there is so much of it, cleverly disguising a less than average sized cupcake. I am going to say that there is as much frosting as there is cupcake. \n\nThe cupcakes are smaller and you do pay a smaller price in comparison to other places, but I hated the frosting!

I haven't been to Retro in, oh, two years--what a dunce I am.  Other cupcake establishments do not compare to the delicacies being served up here, IMHO.  One of my Yelp idols, Amanda M., reminded me that this place is the best and she was right, as usual.  I stopped by on New Year's Eve to pick up dessert for my son, boyfriend, and I to enjoy whilst ringing in 2014.  Service here is quick and friendly; the hardest part is making a decision on which cupcakes to get. \n\nTo ring in 2014, I chose six flavors (descriptions are Retro Bakery's since they know best):\nApple Cider:  cinnamon swirl topped with apple cider buttercream\nRed Carpet:  red cake topped with almond buttercream and red glitter sugar\nPeanut Butter Cup:  chocolate cake topped with peanut butter buttercream and dark chocolate shavings\nSprinkled Donut:  vanilla cake dipped in fudge and sprinkles\nGlazed Donut:  vanilla cake drenched in donut glaze\nThe Retro: chocolate cake stuffed with vanilla fluff and dipped in chocolate fudge (basically the Hostess cupcake, but better)\n\nAs if buying 7 cupcakes for three people weren't enough (I got two of the Red Carpet), I also purchased two of the Red Velvet Chip cookies, a fresh batch of which was just placed in the case, so they were still warm even after the drive home.  I know this because I ate one of the cookies.  And then I ate the other one.  What?  Yes, they were that good.\nThe cupcakes from Retro are moist and flavorful.  It's all about the buttercream frosting there, too, just as their motto declares. The b/f loves peanut butter so the Peanut Butter Cup was for him. I guess he liked it because I didn't even get to try it!  The teen gobbled up his fave, the Red Carpet(red velvet)--that's why I got two, since I knew he wouldn't share his, either.  I really enjoyed the Glazed Donut and Sprinkled Donut flavors followed by the Red Carpet.  If you're vegan, you can get three flavors with 24 hour notice:  Chocolate Loves Vanilla Bean, Cookies and No Cream, and Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.

We stopped by one day after seeing a sign on a sidewalk with balloons attached.  After debating for about two seconds over getting cupcakes, we pulled into the parking lot.  Walking in was not a pleasant experience.  The decor reminds me of a twelve year old pre-pubescent girl.  Not a good thing.  There are way too many non-cupcake related cheap gifts cluttering the right side of the decent sized bakery.  \n\nI ordered a peanut butter chocolate cupcake, my usual, and the husband ordered a chocolate mint cupcake.  My chocolate cake was dry and tasted off.  Other reviewers suggest that this is because they used cake mix, and I have to agree. That's probably it. The frosting however, I liked because it was super sweet and peanut buttery. The grainy texture was a little irritating, but the flavor was still good. Opponents of super sweet will not enjoy these. The husband also had a chocolate cake and the accompanying \""off\"" taste. He also wasn't sure if the mint was in the cake as well as in the frosting. He enjoyed the frosting but remembered the far superior cupcakes we had enjoyed at Yummy Cupcakes in California previously.\n\nI may go back here.

On my way out and halfway to my car I turned around and entered the Cake Cafe. \n\nI do have to agree with previous reviewers concerning the decor. It's as if a bottle of pepto exploded.

Don't worry- it seems that there was never any real danger. \nI looked longingly at the German chocolate confections, at the vanilla with chocolate, at the chocolate with vanilla. Different colors, different decorations, each proclaiming the sweetness held inside, waiting just for me. \nAfter looking over the kichy kichy gift items (I totally would have bought a coffee mug here if I hadn't purchased one last week), I paid my $2.17 and walked out with a smile and a red velvet... that treasure trove of delight just waiting for the post-dinner confectionery carnage. \n\nMaybe some things have changed around Cake Cafe in the past year. If you'll notice, most of the poor reviews are around the same time. All I can say is that I am not a pastry chef and I can not make cupcakes from scratch in my own home, but I do know what I like. The cake was moist and flavorful. The icing was light and sweet . Unfortunately I chose to share this delicacy with the hubski.

Perhaps, though, it may no longer be the latest; fashion is fickle.  That said, it was with great curiosity that I dove into the wild world of designer cupcakeries.  Studies have shown that merely being told a bottle of wine is expensive makes it taste better; so perhaps it would follow with cupcakes as well?\n\nCakes on Walnut is located in a cozy part of \""downtown\"" Champaign, nestled in the neighborhood of Jane Addams, Dandelion, and The Blind Pig.  A rather hip part of town, I'm told.  The shop is inviting; a large front window allows you to catch a faint sight of the delicious morsels awaiting you.  Not to mention that the smell of cupcakes almost demands that you enter, if for no other reason than to bask in the cupcake smell.  The inside of the shop is rather nondescript, tables and chairs, nice and minimalist.  I appreciate that, although I do wonder if it was done as an aesthetic choice at times.  \n\nThe real life in the shop seems to spring from the brightly colored cupcakes beckoning you from behind the counter.  No shier from temptation, I chose the lemon cupcake, a sweet vanilla cupcake with lemon frosting and what I believe were LemonHeads inside the frosting.  Delicious.  My girlfriend got the salted caramel cupcake, so I was able to try two cupcakes for one visit.\n\nMy impression was... whelmed.  Both cupcakes were rather delicious, though they were essentially just mountains of frosting heaped on top this fragile little cake.  The cake itself was not very memorable.  I'm not sure whether to attribute this to the frosting overload or just that the cake is, well, nondescript.  But there it is.\n\nSo, would I recommend it?  I certainly wouldn't dissuade you from visiting.  The frosting is pretty delicious.  But really, that's just it.

That wouldn't be so bad, but these standard sized cupcakes are now being sold for what the larger ones used to run (over $3 with tax). Along with the increased price for less product, as some others have mentioned, the products aren't fresh! This store stays open until 9 PM, but doesn't make products to accommodate that time frame. They are either out of cupcakes or the cupcakes are stale. Eventually I stopped going after 3 PM.\n\nIt seems that this shop has started focusing on being \""cool\"" and emulating cupcakers on Food Network more than on quality product. Sure, they sell lots of cutesy candies and nice looking cupcakes, but everything is overpriced and I could easily make the same thing at home. If you've got a Pinterest, you can make comparable cupcakes. The only reason I go in anymore is for their absolutely amazing brownies, but sadly those are also starting to decrease in size and increase in price.\n\nI've always loved this shop, but they need to revert back to some of their older ways to keep some of their old customers!

I'll pass judgement on those I consumed.\n\nI can firmly state that these cupcakes do indeed tend to leave to be desired, which is a damn shame because they certainly do look great. The icing presentation is amongst the best I've seen. They are certainly pretty to look at.

You get cupcakes and ice cream and that's what they do and to be fair they do it very well. There is a good deal where you can get a cup of ice cream and a cupcake for I believe it was around six dollars so you get a good amount of food for the price. \n\nThe ice cream was excellent and served in a good sized container. You got just enough to satisfy your craving and the flavor of the ice cream is excellent. It's a perfect way to complement the cupcake...But of course there is a fault here. The cupcakes aren't even warm. The experience could have been so much better if the cupcakes were warmed up before you ate them. The contrast of hot and cold is commonly seen in dessert and it could have made this experience easily a four star one. The cupcake however was good for what it was. I chose the Red Velvet Cupcake and the flavor was that of a true Red Velvet cake. It was very moist and it had excellent flavor. The icing was also really good albeit almost too abundant. \n\nOverall this place is quite good. It's definitely a nice place to stop into and I have to say I enjoyed the experience and would go back. With some small improvements it could be an excellent place to go but for now I'm gonna put it at around three stars.,1.0,0.9993255138397216

I think we got spoiled by having her cupcake first, because all of the other variations have failed to impress us as much, if at all.

Maybe that's just the nature of the bundt itself, but we found it to be way too heavy and rich, which only allowed us to eat about half of the thing. Two: It didn't have a lot of flavor.

It was missing that \""wow\"" factor, that melt in your mouth so good you want another one, type of feeling that we get with TC cupcakes. I'm glad we tried it once so that we can scratch it off our list of places to try, but I really doubt that we will be going back for any more bundt's. Oh well, on to the next place! \n\nP.S.

The other company that was serving dinner wasn't ready yet so my friend & I decided to go for dessert first. \nIt was a great decision!\nWe each had a red velvet cupcake that looked as beautiful as it tasted. Usually Red Velvet for me is a little too much on the rich side because they load up that cream cheese frosting, but this cupcake was a perfect combination of cake to icing. \nThe guys at the cart were wonderful to talk to as well. They were very funny & made sure we knew what community events they are at on a regular basis. They also invited everyone down to their dairy farm for a tour & some ice cream in their shop. We will definitely go check them out.\nAfter we had the cupcake I went back and bought 2 more to take home to the hubby, one more Red Velvet & the other was a chocolate with a coffee toffee topping. After our Yelp event was over the guys from Udder Delights invited us back to their truck if we wanted to take home any of their home made ice cream. I took a scoop a vanilla & a scoop of their Red Velvet as well to take home with my cupcakes. \nThey said their ice cream is made from scratch with 6 ingredients. It tasted great! When I did get home my husband grudgingly shared the ice cream & cupcakes with me. I liked the Red Velvet more than the Chocolate cupcake, but both were good. I love homemade vanilla ice cream & this stuff reminded me of making it with my Great-Grandma when I was a kid. The Red Velvet Ice Cream was ok, nothing screamed out Red Velvet to me about it though, it was more like plain chocolate. \nI will definitely go check them out around town though & see what else they have to try.",1.0,0.9992990493774414

Two of them were caramel. My boys were super excited because they love caramel and the guy behind the counter told us that he put a lot of creamy caramel in the center. Well, the cupcakes were good but the only thing caramel about them was the light drizzle of caramel over the frosting. The cream inside was not caramel. My youngest got a strawberry cupcake. He took one bite, made a face and didn't want it anymore. The other two asked if they could split it. I said they could. They each took a bite and made faces and one ran to the trash to spit it out. Of course that meant I had to try it. :)  The frosting was bad. It tasted sour and old. The cake was okay but it had very ugly, blackish chunks of strawberries inside. Not very appealing at all. \n\nI got a pumpkin, cinnamon spice cupcake. It was very good. But I felt ill within a short time after eating it. I kept asking the kids if they felt okay and they said they did. So, I assumed I just didn't feel good for some other reason. Then the next day I decided to split the carrot cupcake with one of my kids for breakfast. Again, it was very good. But shortly after eating it I did not feel well. My son felt find. So apprently there is something in those cupcakes that just doesn't agree with me. \n\nOverall, the cupcakes were okay. There was just that one that was bad. The rest were good although I felt the caramel was misrepresented. I still think Retro-Bakery offers a better and more unique cupcake.

It's a smallish place, and very sparsely decorated as someone else said.  From a presentation standpoint, these cupcakes are very pretty.  I decided to go with the six pac.  I had two chocolate, two red velvet, one white with whtie frosting and a pumpkin.  Average price was about $2.50 each.  The guy behind the counter wasn't skinny, so I knew he had eaten enough of these cupcakes and probably enjoyed them, a good sign.  He did admit later that was the case. \n\nI am a sweet tooth, but whenever I buy a cake or cupcake, frosting is the second most important thing on my mind.  If you have a tasty cake, the frosting can only make it better.  But if the cake sucks, I don't care what is on top. That's just me, I guess. From a texture and moistness standpoint, their cupcakes were average, not moist enough to be great but moist enough. A great cupcake has that rich mouth feel from the butter or whatever fats are used. After it sat overnight in their closed plastic container, it was even more dry and I only ate part of it before tossing it.  \n\nIt did smell pretty good in there, so I knew it would taste at least okay.  The pumpkin, white, and chocolate cake for me was average, but red velvet is IMO the best of the ones I tried. I think maybe the addition of red dye to the chocolate batter gave it some additiona flavor as well.  Ironically it may have been the cream cheesy frosting that made it better, too.\n\nAll in all, not bad. We need more cupcakes in this world.",1.0,0.8222535848617554

I was hoping that their cupcakes were just as good, but unfortunately it wasn't a hit for me at all.\n\nStrawberry cupcake: slightly dry and the flavors were almost there.  I felt as if I was missing something in the cake...maybe a pinch of salt would make a difference?  The frosting is heavy and old fashioned, meaning that slight grainy texture.  That's definitely not bad, but it was pretty heavy.\n\nChocolate cupcake: moist, which was good, but bland.  My husband swears that this cupcake was out of the box.  Who knows, it could be, but if it's from scratch they need to change their batter so that it kicks the flavors out more.\n\nOverall, it's a cute shop but the cupcakes aren't as divine and moist as other places in Vegas.

I knew about this place before because I used to work with one of the owners at a previous job, but did not decide to check it out until I purchased a groupon.\n\nI think between my husband and I we have tried at least eight different flavors of cupcakes and all have been very good. My favorite flavors are the Pink Cadillac which is a strawberry cupcake with a buttercream frosting. So delicious and moist. I am a sucker for a strawberry cupcake anyways and this one is amazing. I could eat these everyday. The frosting is a little heavy for my taste just because of how sugary frosting tends to be. I could do with about half the amount of frosting that is put on each cupcake but it does taste really good. The toasted coconut cupcake is also one of my favorites. Super moist white cake with frosting and toasted coconut flakes on top. I am practically drooling thinking about it. My husbands favorites are the Reese with a spoon which is a chocolate cupcake with a peanut butter frosting and chocolate peanut butter candies on top. He also enjoys the red velvet cupcake. I have had a few of the others but do not like them as much as the strawberry and coconut. I am not a fan of the chocolate chips in the chocolate cake batter, but that's just me. \n\nI think the price for each cupcake is fair just going off of what some other bakeries charge per cupcake. It is under $3 per cupcake and I think less than $2.50 per cake pop, which are also fun, but the frosting is way too sweet for me on these. I have only tried these once. \n\nI am all for supporting a local business and the owners of Mind Over Batter are great people.

My wife likes baking and cupcakes, so I thought this would be a great Valentines gift.\n\nI went to the store on Feb 13.  As I was looking at the menu, I mentioned to the person behind the counter that I didn't know how I was going to buy $60 worth of product.  She informed me that the Groupon I purchased was for \""custom\"" items, not what they already had made, AND that custom items had to be ordered in advance.  What???  While \""custom\"" wasn't defined on the Groupon, I (and others, I later learned) assumed that it was a generic \""custom\"" not a \""place order in advance and pick up later, custom.\""\n\nShe informed me that they were going to have some custom (wait, don't \""custom\"" items have to be ordered in advance?) items available on Valentine's Day and that I should come back.  Well, I had driven to Elliot and McClintock from Ahwatukee and had appointments that would prohibit me from coming back the next day.  Her next suggestion was to just buy what I wanted and to use the Groupon later.  I'm sure that would be the best thing... for the store.  Next she mentioned that she wasn't happy with how Groupon had worded the deal and that she had dealt with this before... enough times that Groupon had to send out a clarification on this deal (I checked when I got home and I did not receive this e-mail from Groupon).  That's when I realized that I was dealing with the owner! \n\nI was truly baffled at how a small business owner would not want to go out of her way to do whatever it takes to make a customer happy.  Especially, a NEW customer.  Isn't $60 worth of product still $60 worth of product no matter how it's labeled?  I asked if I could buy a dozen cupcakes and a box of cake pops using the Groupon, which would have been around $52 worth of product.  I was told she \""couldn't\"" do this.  I thought as the owner you COULD do anything you want to make your customers happy.  Not here.  In the end, she \""let me\"" use my $60 Groupon to buy $40 worth of items, being sure to charge me for the small amount I was over $40.\n\nThe cupcakes were great.  My wife was thrilled with the presentation.  Baking is one of her hobbies, so praise from her means alot.  The frosting, while generously applied, is fairly light, which is a neat trick.  I'm guessing that despite the issue with the Groupon that we'll be visiting Mind Over Batter again.

And I know I'm probably the lone wolf here, but I don't like chocolate chips. They were in my german chocolate cupcake which really didn't need any extra chocolate AND they were in the red velvet....why would they do that?

I bought a Groupon which was $10 for $20 worth of product.  Cupcakes cost $3.15 each, so I ordered 6.  Do the math and it's less than $20.  When I handed my Groupon to the cashier, she said, \""Oh, you get 7 cupcakes with this Groupon\"".   Ok... I picked a 7th cupcake, which didn't fit in the box, so she tipped it sideways in a styrofoam cup and put it in a separate bag (????).  Then she rang up my purchase, and said I owed her $23.10.  I said, well, take off the 7th cupcake, because I only wanted to use my groupon.  She said I had to hit the $20 mark to use this groupon.  So, BUYER BEWARE.  Your groupon is NOT $10 for $20 worth of product.  There is a $3.10 UPCHARGE when you get to the store.  I was with my kids and didn't wish to disappoint them, so I paid the ADDITIONAL 30% UPCHARGE and took my \""just okay\"" cupcakes and left.  I will not be back.  Not because the cupcakes aren't ok, as they are decent.  I will not be back because of the SCAM at the cash register.

Like Gigi's, I can't find a cupcake that really justifies the higher-than-grocery-store prices of the cupcakes.  Located at the Blakeney Crossing shopping center, which is across Rea Rd from the larger Blakeney shopping center, it is a cute little shop. \n\nThe have several flavors that they serve all of the time, and then special daily flavors.  On a Thursday evening after a lovely dinner at Salsarita's, which is right next door, I stopped in and got a vanilla/vanilla, a chocolate chip, a raspberry bliss and a white chocolate pretzel.  The frosting on all is kind of grainy, but not overly sweet.  The cupcakes were moist, but I didn't think were super delicious.  The chocolate chip seemed to have a good quality chocolate chip, in the plain vanilla cupcake.  Raspberry bliss was a vanilla cupcake with a small squirt of raspberry jam in it.  White chocolate pretzel was... bleh - I didn't like it.  And though I got 4 different varieties, they all really tasted the same.  Too much frosting.\n\nOnce your cupcakes are purchased, they also have a candy bar where you can add toppings to your cupcake.

If you buy 4, it's $12 and they put them in a box for you.  Otherwise, they get put in a bag.  That's right, cupcakes in a bag - that's not going to make a mess, eh?\n\nIt is a nice little store, and the cupcakes would be a cute treat for a special occasion, but like Gigi's, I was left with a *shrug* kind of ambivalence about the cupcakes.",0.0,0.766735851764679

One I really liked, but the other one not so much.\n\nActually, I came about this place not knowing it was the one star wonder that Janice C had previously reviewed.  I was headed toward the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram when one of my friends spotted it.  The store was about 10 minutes away from closing so I stepped in and purchased two cupcakes at $3.75 a piece.\n\nMost of the cupcakes here are decorated in glitter.  That alone was enough to turn away my two friends who probably thought I was kidding when I voiced the desire to actually walk in for a cupcake.\n\nStill in my San Francisco Giants-loving mode I selected The Julius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=os6ho_qd-sCDWrHQ7sFOKg) with its swirl of orange and vanilla buttercream on top of an orange and pineapple cake, and a Grasshopper (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=sfW64iixXLiMb9hthriMCQ) because I love the combination of mint and dark chocolate.\n\nThe characteristics of the two cupcakes were completely different from one another.  It was almost like they were created by different bakers.  The cupcakes were both dome shaped on top so the amount of frosting on each cake looked like more than there actually was.\n\nThe Julius was just bad.  While the cake wasn't too sweet, almost buttery in fact, it was a bit dry and had little to none orange or pineapple flavor.  There were itty, bitty bits of substance in the cake that I'll assume was pineapple.  The super sweet buttercream had no orange flavor either but tasted somewhat chemical like with an odd, bitter aftertaste.  My friend suggested they used actual foil to create the glitter and that was the taste I was experiencing.  I won't buy into that suggestion, but he may have had a point.\n\nThe Grasshopper, however, was very good.  The dark chocolate cake was super moist, super chocolaty and not very crumbly.  The mint chocolate buttercream tasted great but it was much thinner than the orange-vanilla buttercream.  As soon as I bit into the cupcake the mint chocolate buttercream began to roll off of the cake.  The shiny green glitter on this cake had no chemical aftertaste.\n\nThey were definitely two very different cupcakes.

The cake had an artificial raspberry taste, and I can tell from experience these are NOT MADE FROM SCRATCH, they taste like a COMMERCIAL BASE and what makes it so bad was that IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY DRY! and since I bake I KNOW it wasn't because it sat too long, it was because it stayed in the oven too long from the get go.  The top was hard and crunchy, a plastic fork could barely cut it, and the rest of the cake was just dry.  The frosting has crusted over but I scraped the crusted frosting off to get to the softer frosting.  It tasted spoiled and thats probably due to the liquor flavoring, but it was soft and waaaay too sweet.  i know its supposed to made with butter, but it just tasted like shortening mixed with sugar until light and fluffy.

Little did I know that all the nasty cupcakes I've eaten in my lifetime had joined forces to create Sweet Surrender cupcakes, probably the worst cupcakes I've eaten.  Ever.\n\nUgh, I expected a lot for a cupcake shop located inside Palazzo.  Found right near the guest elevators, the shop is so small, you'd miss it if you blinked while walking by.  The place also sells (supposedly) hard to find candies and treats, but as a cupcake fiend, one can only guess what I was here for....\n\nBetween Chocolate Ganache, Lemon Strawberry, Carrot, Strawberry, Coconut, Chocolate Fudge, and Red Velvet, I chose the latter two.  The cupcakes looked prettier than your standard cupcake, but these looks would just turn out to be hopelessly deceiving (no, I didn't have beer googles on).  Again, good thing I had a purchasing limit.  Cost?  Six dollars ($3 each), but, um, not including TAX.  I have never been charged tax on a cupcake.  Whatever, I wasn't about to make a fuss over 49 cents.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try these bad boys until 24 hours later, but I don't think this is an excuse for how poor these cupcakes tasted.  The cream cheese on the Red Velvet tasted..spoiled.  I actually spit out my bite.  The Chocolate Fudge cupcake was slightly better - the fudge topping was bearable.  But the cakes of both cupcakes were dry dry dry - like choking on sandpaper.\n\nAfter I tossed the remnants of my cupcakes, J asked me, \""That bad, huh?  So you won't ever go back?\""  My reply, \""Hells no.\""\n\nP.S.  There's also some decadent $750 cupcake on the menu.

I would recommend sharing one so that you can enjoy the flavor of one with only half the calories to burn off later at the gym. First one I had was the red velvet. I use that flavor as my benchmark for all the cupcake shops I visit whenever possible. Not sure why...maybe because it was the first flavor I had at sprinkles? Even though I think the red velvet at sprinkles isn't great at all. \n\nAnyway, for the red velvet, it definitely was not a love at first bite moment. The cake portion tasted like grocery store grade cake. The frosting left much to be desired. While fluffy and light, it lacked flavor or any kind of special ooomph. I thought maybe I went on an off day so I tried Sweet Daddy's two more times. Next I tried the pink cadillac and the next time after that I had an oreo cupcake. Each time I was left with the same feeling. Glittery frosting and pretty presentations cannot make up for the lack of flavor and dry, bland cake. All style and no substance.

Staff was friendly, store was very cute, cupcakes look like a work of art BUT, this place is deceiving!! Most unappealing cupcakes I've ever had. They may look like delicious but they are far from it. First of all, I used to live in NJ, near a Mr. Cupcakes shop and their cupcakes were so freakin delicious, you want to put the whole thing in your mouth in one shot. Not to mention they are only $1.50 each. Sweet Daddy cupcakes are much bigger so I get that they are more expensive but for $3.50 each I was expecting to be blown away. Bought 4 cupcakes (because it's cheaper that way) got home, two of them were toppled over in the box and frosting fell off. They are too top heavy with all of that frosting. Every single one of them had the most God awful icing. Even though they were all different flavors, all of the icings tasted exactly the same!! Could not tell the difference between any of the flavors. Sugary, gross, flat, flavorless icing. The cakes were not dry, but not too moist either and they were so damn big. Who could eat a cupcake that big with that much icing? The best way that I could put it is that they tasted like something you could make from a store bought cupcake mix with store bought icing, no wait, I take that back, because store bought cupcakes and icing actually taste so much better than these!! We ended up tossing them all into the trash. A waste of $12. Will be on the hunt for a REAL cupcake bakery because this is definitely not it. I promise you that all of the people who have written good reviews have never tasted a REAL cupcake before so unfortunately this is all they know. Trust me there is better out there.

To be completely frank, I can see why.\n\nWhen I entered the store, I noticed that there were only a few displays of cupcakes (9 different flavors I believe?) I guess I'm just used to Sprinkles cupcakes where they have a lot more variety. The employee working was nice and courteous when I asked about any recommendations. I eventually settled on a red velvet cupcake, which is what I always order when trying out a new bakery.\n\nI noticed that the cupcakes were JUMBO. Much larger than what you'd get at other cupcakeries, which was a plus. It was $3.50 for a single and $12 for 4, which is pretty standard, but since you get a larger cupcake than usual, it is a good deal. \n\nThe packaging was very functional. If you order one cupcake, it comes in its own individual plastic container with a Sweet Daddy Cupcakes sticker. The container also has indentations so your cupcake doesn't move around and so you can pick up your cupcake without getting frosting on your hands. Functional and convenient packaging is very important to me, clearly.\n\nFINALLY, the cupcake itself. I was very underwhelmed. I don't know about you, but I like my frosting dense! The cream cheese frosting, which in itself had a good, light flavor, also felt like it was so whipped that I was eating cream-cheese flavored air. While that may be a plus for some people, I was sorely disappointed. The cake itself was good. It's dense and moist, which is much better than the alternative (dry and crumbly), but like other reviewers have said, it tastes like it came from a box. \n\nOverall, I'll have to pass on making a return trip here. At a certain point, nice decorations, good service, and being the underdog on a reality show just doesn't cut it.",0.0,0.5162928700447083

I never thought much about it til I moved to Sm-Albany in the East Coast where there is a serious deficit in cupcake shops. While visiting family in Vegas for the holidays, I was determined to get some damned good cupcakes by going on a cupcake hunt during my last week. Thank you, Yelp, for giving me the top 5 cupcakeries in Henderson!\n\nSo anyways, Caked was the second stop on my list. Found it easily and thought it was funny and fortunate that the bakery was right next to a Starbucks. Coffee and cupcakes? Yes m'aam!  It's a cute place, and I loved the decor--especially the silver branch on the wall with the cupcake ornaments!

I tried the mango first because I haven't had that flavor cupcake before. First impression: sickly sweet frosting, and the top of the cupcake was hard and crunchy. Sorry buddy, but I like soft and moist cupcakes---not crunchy cupcakes! I got a headache after eating it because it was too sweet. I'm typing this up two hours later and I still have the headache.\n\nMy sister, brother, and cousin had the other cupcakes. My sister is also a cupcake addict and she didn't have good words for the Nutella cupcake she chose. I had stashed the cupcakes in the fridge in the afternoon, and she exclaimed how tough the frosting was. \""I don't taste the Nutella in this at all!\"", she said.

I was excited to try some of the more unique \""island\"" flavors, but unfortunately, when I was there OVER HALF of the flavors were sold out. An original selection of probably 12-15 cupcakes was cut down to 6 or 7. (Maybe this was because I came in after 4 on a Friday....) A couple of those had chocolate, which I don't like, so I basically got all the rest of the flavors. I tried: red velvet, coconut (also has the Hawaiian name, which I forget), and vanilla bean. All three were slightly hard, like they'd been sitting out for a couple days (again, is this because I didn't come first thing in the morning?). Also, barring the actual coconut sprinkled on top of that cupcake, they all tasted the same.

OMG, these have to be the worst ones I have had from a retail store.  I would get a store bought one any day.  After reading about the reviews, I was really intrigued.  I love cupcakes!  I was so excited to find the Yelp listing while watching a show at Planet Hollywood.  While we waited for a table at P.F. Chang's and my partner killing time at the slots, I decided to kill time by going to the Sugar Factory.  I was met with very courteous sales people and was given help  when I had questions.  They were very attentive.  I found out the reason why they were attentive when I brought my partner after dinner.  Nothing has a price tag or label!  You have to ask the sales people for the price.  Who does that?  I was appalled.  Customers should know how much an item is without asking anyone.  \n\nOK, I got distracted there for a bit.  Let me get back to my rating of their cupcakes.  I was really looking forward to getting them.  When I saw them, I was happy to see very visually beautiful cupcakes.  They're also BIG.  Not your typical size at all.  I decided to get the Mel B. Sugar Free Red Velvet and got the partner the Lemon.  We waited to eat this until we got home for dessert after a nice late night dinner.  When we finally took the first bite, we were met with stale, flavorless, and I think they used sugar frosting for their sugar free cupcake.  The red velvet frosting was so sweet.  Also, they were very stale and lacked any flavor.  Red velvet is my go to cupcake and after having this, I will NEVER get a cupcake from here.  The lemon didn't have enough lemon for my taste.  When you say lemon flavored, it is supposed to give a bang of flavor.  I have to say, we did come here very late so I would safely assume that they were not the freshest, but they seemed like more than a day old.  That is just unacceptable.  Another contention I have is the absurdity of their pricing.  The cupcakes were $5.50!  As big as they were and beautifully packaged, this price point doesn't justify the product.  \n\nIn closing, this is just for their cupcakes and not for their other products and customer service.  I rarely give out 1 star ratings or selectively just choose 1 product to base a store it's rating.  But these cupcakes were the worst thing i have ever had.  I would gladly go to the Cupcakery any day!",0.0,0.9988123178482056

I'm not big on Sprinkles cupcakes, but these were actually worse than Sprinkles! The cake is dry, the frosting is hard, dense, and way too sweet. It just needed 5 mins. or so less cooking time. Never again! Some good points... staff is great. Most of these Vegas shops aren't very friendly. But the staff was really attentive and when I found out their lollipops were $22-$25, I was in utter shock, and the man behind the counter gave me a \""I don't blame you\"" look. The cupcakes comes in a great packgaging, a clear box, and they even give you a fork and napkins if you ask. The shop is just too cute, and since I went during Halloween, it was very festive. I would love to try their gelato some day, and I do see myself coming back, but probably only for candies or gelato.",0.0,0.8245192170143127

They do look really good, and the fact that it was basically free if you print your name and sign your signature on the guest check-in list made it an offer hard to refused. \n\nFrom looking at the cupcakes I do feel that on some of them there is a disportionate amount of frosting to the tiny cupcakes (which were quit moist).  If it is an exact scale miniature of the full size ones sold at the store, I think the frosting can be overwhelming for some (almost an 1:1 ratio of frosting to the cupcake by volume).  Especially since the frosting are mostly buttercream based, which is just a lot of butter fat and sugar that contributes to that not so great mouth feel, unless you wash it down with a cup of hot coffee or chocolate.\n\nAnyway, I liked the Strawberry Shortcake, and another chocolate thing (not sure exact which one, since I don't see it on the picture menu I picked up atthe booth).  The Merry Margarita didn't do it for me.\n\nWith the buy 3 get 1 free coupon the CSN Culinary Club was also passing out, I will go back and try a couple more flavors.

As a baker myself (cupcakes no less), I'm baffled by this.  It's a standard sized cupcake with a ridiculous amount of frosting.  Apparently the cake-to-icing ratio rule doesn't apply here.  And no wonder they are so expensive!  I'm not sure why some cupcake stores feel the need to try and make their customers feel better for paying more for a cupcake by putting a ton of frosting on top.  It actually makes it worse because it's hard to enjoy the cupcake when you're choking down copious amounts of buttercream or worse - scraping off most of the icing so you can eat the cupcake!  Also?  You shouldn't have to eat a cupcake with a fork and knife.  Just saying.\n\nSo, we purchased 6 cupcakes.  Well, our Living Social coupon purchased us 6 cupcakes.  The flavors we picked were Birthday Surprise, Chocolate Salted Caramel, Grasshopper, White Chocolate Macadamia, Midnight Magic Chocolate Chip and Spumoni.  The cake by itself was a little dry (we purchased ours later in the afternoon so it probably wasn't as fresh) and the icing by itself was ridiculously sweet.  The combination of cake and icing was pretty good but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Of the 6, I preferred the Grasshopper and the Spumoni.\n\nIn regards to service, the girl at the counter was pretty cool.  She was helpful with the flavor selections and pleasant when I presented my coupon.  \n\nIf I had to pay full price for these I would have been even more disappointed, but luckily I didn't.

Not to mention the frosting had developed a crust, which only happens with old cupcakes (we were there at 10am!!). Sampling a few more, I realized they were all disgusting and tasted the same. I was so disappointed. \n\nA few weeks later I used my other Groupon and gave them another shot. I even asked the lady behind the counter if these were freshly made cupcakes. Before the question was even completely out of my mouth she lipped off at me snidely and said \""Yes, they are made here\"" in a very condescending way. Did I mention the first trip I made, the girl behind the counter had the personality of a wet mop and seemed pissed we were there? Both women both times were not what one expects working in a bakery. \n\nBottom line: Gigi's cupcakes are gross. Do yourself a favor and check out The Cupcakery. I've been going there years and have NEVER been disappointed. Even Smith's or Albertsons do a better job with cupcakes. But for those of you that like frosting that tastes like it's made with decade old Crisco and cake that wouldn't get a D- in home ec., then Gigi's is for you.",0.0,0.995003879070282

The two inches of frosting on each cupcake wasn't very exciting either.

Really, it's a work of art.  \n\nTheir boxes are super cute. A single cupcake goes into a box that holds the cupcake upright so it doesn't flop over and ruin the frosting.

I've had cupcakes at the Venetian and they were okay. So maybe this place had a bad day? \n\nThe place is cute. The cupcakes are adorable globs of sweet. They over-frost, as everyone says, but then the sprinkle it with either raw sugar, choco chips, or sprinkles and then there's another decoration on top of that, such as a flower, or a cookie. Very cute! \n\nNow, I'm not a cupcake connoisseur. You'd never think so from reading my reviews, but I love to buy cupcakes, I don't like to eat them. Does that make any sense? So, in my case, Gigi's is the perfect store for me, because the cupcakes LOOK gorgeous but they taste awful. \n\nCan you imagine putting plaster in your mouth? Then can you imagine adding a ton of sugar to that plaster? That pretty much sums up the flavor of ALL the cupcakes. It didn't matter if it was Citrus Green Tea (ha, don't make me laugh) or Blackberry surprise, it all tasted the same, gummy and over-sweet. There is no other flavor, but the colors of the cupcake are different. Maybe that's why they have different names, it's to describe the color of their cupcakes? \n\nThe only one that tasted barely ok and had any flavor was the oreo cookie, I did get hints of cookie and cream flavor. \n\nThe cakes were really stale and dry. Yuck. \n\nThe lady working was really generous. She gave me three free cupcakes for buying two. Too bad I didn't eat any of them.

The cupcakes are pretty good.  I haven't tried the cake pops or cookies, but they look really good. \n\nOn Facebook I read about these unique flavors they make, but on our three (maybe four?) visits, I rarely see any of these.  One night we did make it in time to get a policeman's special (cupcake with mocha icing and a mini doughnut on top).  So cute.  My son was dying to try it.  He really didn't comment about it after he ate it, which tells me it was just okay.  Hubby had no comment either.  Personally, I couldn't even taste the mocha in the icing.  He also said it just tasted like vanilla.  I kinda feel the same way about others I have tried.  The cupcake doesn't quite live up to the description.\n\nMost disappointing to me is that I have yet to encounter a staff member that seemed gung ho to be at work.  I mean a cupcake shop is a place where people go for a treat, they go there happy, they take their kids there to make them happy, it should be a light hearted and fun experience.  I have yet to get that vibe while in the Cupcakery.  I actually almost feel like kids aren't really welcome (and yes, my kids are very well behaved!)\n\nThe interior is really cute and I love the way it's decorated - it feels nice and homey and like the owner really put a lot of love and thought into it.   My complaint is that they write the names of the cupcakes on the front of the bakery case with dry erase marker.  This seems so unprofessional to me. The handwriting is difficult to read,  and not very attractive (sorry!).  I don't see why they don't make some pretty little place cards to put in front of the cupcakes.  They have the same regulars every day so this wouldn't be difficult - they would just need additional ones for the specials.  I think this touch would be more in line with the decor rather than neon dry erase marker.\n\nI feel bad about this review, because from what I read on Facebook, the owner is clearly passioniate about her business.

I have had a few other flavors of cupcakes, and anyone who says the cakes are dry is probably eating them the next day.  Also, someone mentioned the size was the same as homemade cupcakes and that is definitely not true.  I can eat about 3 cupcakes from a home muffin tin but can barely finish a cupcake from Cupcrazed.  I've also now had a chance to have cupcakes from some other cakeries in Charlotte, and Cupcrazed cupcakes are a little better than the others.  The people and the owner have all been really nice too.  \n\nOf course, what brought me back to update the review was the fact that they were on Cupcake Wars and won.  A few days after the episode, my wife brought me a couple of sweet tea cupcakes, which they made on the show that featured a southern theme.  The first one I ate was delicious.  It was moist, had a slight sweet taste, and a lemon frosting that also had a sweetness to it.  I ate the 2nd one the next day, and despite being stored properly, that one was dry, but that's to be expected from cupcakes that aren't made with artificial preservatives when you eat them the next day.\n\nThe only thing I would like to see from Cupcrazed now is all natural cupcakes, such as a natural red velvet cupcakes.  Things like beet juice can be used for color, and sadly, some people are allergic to red food dye (a lot of people are actually).  Anyone who says anything bad about this place most likely is connected to someone else who owns a cupcake shop.

I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation, which had coconut and a pineapple filling.

The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided.\n- The frosting itself was way too dense.

So, I take no joy in expressing my disappointment with Cupcakes By Design. \n\nThe first time I went in there, I was really surprised by what I saw. For $3.50 per cupcake, I expected a little bit of creativity in the decoration or something. Instead, I found cupcakes that were about the size of what I bake at home with what amounted to a dollop of frosting. Yes, they obviously used a piping tip but there was no sense of fun or creativity in the decoration. And for $3.50, there should be a lot more frosting. I had their banana cupcake which was OK. It was the first time I had a banana cake that wasn't like banana bread but rather cake with some banana flavoring--though I believe they used fresh bananas. The frosting was...meh. Whenever I go to another city, I always stop at a bakery. And it's rare that I've seen any place charge $3.50 for the size that this place offers. I just can't justify it in this case.\n\nI was also a little soured when I stopped in their another time to talk to the owner about an event I was having. I wasn't even asking for any donations--only if they happened to have day-old cupcakes they wanted to get rid of. If not, no big deal. I was going to go on and explain about this community event I was putting on called CupcakeCamp and maybe ask someone to come judge and I even had a little flyer, but the owner totally shut me down before I could go further. She wasn't rude by any means. But she certainly put the curt in courteous. I understand having trepidation with a new business and it's fine to say no to me. But to not even hear me out first, frankly, kind of sucked. And if you're a new business, you'd think one would want to hear about an opportunity to freely promote to a big crowd.

How I wanted to love this place! The primary turn-off for us was the brunette working at 6p on Thursday, November 7. When asked if she liked the cupcakes she was serving compared to Sprinkles, she said she didn't really know. When asked several questions about ingredients and flavors, she said she didn't know. When asked how I could determine which flavors were available on any given day, she said she didn't know but that I 'could call every morning.' When I suggested they put their daily flavors on their website, she airily commented, 'Yeah, I guess they should do that.' She was quite indifferent to us and seemed like she would rather be anywhere else but there. \n\nAs to the cupcakes, we spent $44 on a dozen - three chocolate-chocolate, one pumpkin, two red velvet, one chocolate with powdered sugar, three cherry pie cupcakes,  and two carrot cakes. I was very surprised at what seemed (and tasted) like canned cherry pie filling in the cherry pie cupcakes! Quite disappointed at the overwhelmingly sweet frosting on the remainder of the cakes that left that filmy, lard-y feeling in the roof of your mouth. The chocolate cakes were all very, very dry.\n\nAs an avid baker, chef and unofficial local cupcake connoisseur, I was deeply disappointed in both the service and the product.",0.0,0.999306321144104

(Urban Cookies had their awesome German Chocolate Cupcakes, The Sweet Tooth Fairy had a delicious variety (I tried the Sweet Potato Cupcake), and GiGi's was in attendance (I wasn't able to try theirs).) Other vendors included: TLC Bakery (yummy Pecan Pie Cupcake), Whoopie Baking Co (Chocolate Whoopie!), Mind Over Batter (my new favorite - the Dark Helmet!) and many, many more. I love being able to try and discover new cupcake vendors, especially for a good cause! 100% profit was given to a Veterans Charity this year, which is fantastic.

The Tiramisu was the one I thought I'd become obsessed with, but no worries there.  On the dry side, okay cake flavor, and SUPER sweet make-my-teeth-hurt frosting.  This one also has cream cheese in the middle, but ironically barely had any, which is too bad because the half-teaspoon of it there was had really good flavor.  It would have been so much better with a layer of cream cheese frosting and a layer of the coffee frosting.  A dot of cream cheese in the middle does not a tiramisu cupcake make! \n\nThe other flavor I tried was the peanut butter cup.  Frosting was nice and fluffy and had a good flavor, but I was really disappointed in the cake.  Very dry, kindof hard around the edges, and really didn't taste like chocolate -- maybe they got some pumpkin batter mixed in with it by accident??\n\nI would only go back if I was already in the area and was with other people who wanted to go there.

What makes Cuckoo's unique is their bold and innovative flavours. Ginger cupcakes on St. Patrick's Day, Grapefruit Meringue, a 'Kamikaze Cupcake' with a lime vodka filling, and my all time favorite: white chocolate cake with lavender filling. (I still think about it despite having had it mother's day 2012) \n\nDon't get me wrong the classics here are amazing too. The Chocolate cupcake is so moist and decadent, the Raspberry White Chocolate classic and delicious, the Lemon buttercream tart and delicious. There is, however, one classic that I feel has missed the mark for me, and without nailing it I can't in clear conscience give it five stars; and that is the Red Velvet. Red Velvet is rich, moist, and - if done right, naturally red from the mixture of vinegar and cocoa powder. Cuckoo's Red Velvet is artificially red and dry. I also don't taste that decadent cocoa flavour that I do in the Chocolate cupcake. \n\nDespite that one setback, I highly recommend Cuckoo's.

The credit card machine also takes FOREVER! \n\nWe drive down to my husbands school where we were heading and start to dig in. The frosting is SO gritty. It is also covered in glitter, which I didn't find appealing. And why the hell is there so much of it?? I scraped off all of the frosting and just ate the cake, which was also just as bad. I didn't try my husbands cake, which was chocolate, but mine was weird and tasted a lot like kool-aid or fruit punch, or something. I have never had a strawberry cupcake taste so artificial. Oh wait, yes I have. Its called a box mix. It tasted just like it came out of a box. There were red chunks of something in my cake batter. Not sure what the hell those were. Gummies?

However the cakes are missing one important ingredient: moisture and authentic flavor.\n\nThe red velvet cupcake tastes very artificial and I sincerely doubt there was any cocoa in it. It tasted like artificial flavoring and food coloring. To say it tasted like Duncan Hines is an insult to Duncan Hines. The chocolate cake was the same, lacking moisture and taste. The frosting on the red velvet is supposed to have a rich, creamy cream cheese frosting but the frosting was more like powdered sugar with butter. That's it, just a sugar flavor.\n\nThe chocolate frosting was the same, no chocolate taste hardly in the frosting, only sugar. I feel terrible we wasted over $7 on cupcakes in this place.

We will see)\n-Open early as well and they offer oatmeal along with their other goodies\n-Cupcakes for various dietary needs---diabetic, vegan, gluten free and many flavors\n-Good selection of fro yo flavors which you can get swirl along with the standard fro yo toppings\n-Outdoor and indoor seating\n\nThe bad:\n-It kills me to say this but I wasn't too impressed with the cupcakes. I got a chocolate espresso and I believe either gluten free or vegan blueberry cupcake. The chocolate was hard on the outside, not to moist and had me reaching for some milk. The blueberry one was actually tastier-it tasted healthy but still pleasing to my taste buds. It didn't look like a traditional cupcake when I took the paper off though, kinda looked knotted.\n-Cupcakes are around $3 a pop. If I'm paying that much for one, I want one on steroids.\n-The fro yo I tried (strawberry banana) tasted good but was a grainy texture.\n\nWho knows, seeing it was opening weekend I am sure they are still working on what works taste wise and such but I will still frequent other cupcake places I visit or enjoy the company of my girl, Betty Crocker. Concept wise, I think it's an awesome idea to combine a cupcake and fro yo place in one with late hours but don't think I will go there again just for the cupcakes.

I was reaaallly hoping they would be super fantastic. \n\nNot so much. The carrot cake was moist and well made but I expected more creme cheese in the frosting. 3.5/5 for this one.

Tasked with the job of finding cupcakes for my sister's birthday but having absolutely no idea where to go, I went online and discovered, lo and behold, there was a cupcake shop located a short drive (or a long walk) away from my apartment. And so, I found myself heading to Simplement D Liche on St-Denis just south of Duluth.\n\nI was in a hurry so I was unable to stay for long to enjoy the shop itself but I loved what I saw of its clean and simple look - a beautifully cupcake-filled display certainly didn't hurt my perception! They have both normal and mini-sized cupcakes to enjoy. The flavors change regularly so I picked 6 different from those available that day and went about my day at work. I got to enjoy them over the course of the next 3 days.\n\nThe flavors I selected were vanilla, dulce de leche, key lime, red velvet, chocolate peanut butter and chocolate raspberry. I got to try the final four from that list. The cupcakes themselves were of a denser and richer consistency than I am used to in a cupcake  - not that I am complaining. They still succeeded in being sweet and airy which, when paired with the different creamy and light frostings for each options created delicious cupcakes which hit the right flavor profile each time. None of them were overbearing with their flavour either - at no point did you get that \""This is WAY too [insert flavour]-ly\"" moment. The key lime one had a nice lime taste that didn't hit the overly sour notes you tend to get with bad key lime desserts. The chocolate peanut butter was as close to Reese as you could get without mixing the two items within the cake batter itself. The red velvet was as classic as you would hope to expect from such a flavour. The chocolate raspberry was the least memorable of the 4 but was still quite good all things considered.\n\nAll in all, D Liche was a great first experience in the Montreal cupcake scene that I would highly recommend if you are in need of a cupcake fix. Now I need to go expand my cupcake horizons within my wonderful city..... oh Woe is me ;)\n\nCheers!",1.0,0.9974040389060974

I stopped by today and left feeling unimpressed.  I purchased the Tropical Storm which is supposed to be a lime cake.  Although the cake is beautifully moist and soft, it has ZERO flavor.  The cream cheese icing is great, but that's simple enough to do at home.  The cupcakes were gorgeous, but looks aren't the reason I purchased.  The previous review is correct about the insane amount of icing.  Luckily I don't feel guilty for throwing out the majority of my cupcake.\n\nI did buy other flavors for the rest of my family.  If they have any stellar response, I'll update, but otherwise, I'll likely not return.\n\n**Updated - These were a bust in my house.  My 4 year old daughter didn't even finish half of the icing, much less hardly any of the cake (Birthday Surprise cupcake).  I taste the other cupcakes (chocolate and red velvet) and while they were better than mine, still not good enough for a repeat visit.",0.0,0.9906925559043884

I was so excited about this new cupcakery and the flavors sounded divine.  I do get a little concerned whenever a bakery is a chain...I feel like the quality suffers.  But, I was willing to give GiGi's a fair shake and unfortunately, I should have gone with my gut.\n\nWe ordered the Cinnamon Roll and Chocolate Salted Carmel.  My two cupcake-eating friends were thrilled with the selections and thoroughly enjoyed their cupcakes.  So, for the average cupcake eater--you may enjoy them.  For those of us that are much more critical--BEWARE.  I'm going to go on a limb and say these cupcakes are not made from scratch.  I'm pretty sure I saw a Sara Lee box on the counter in the back--I could be mistaken (just kidding, but not really).  The icing was sweet but didn't have a lot of flavor..it tasted artificial.  I described it to my friend this way:  The cake was crumbly and out of a box, not dense, not moist, not soft, just a little dry and cake-like.  The icing was like lard--I could tell I was taking in empty calories filled with all types of garbage.  It just didn't have a homemade feel to it at all.  It was as if they grabbed a container of icing off of the baking isle at Harris Teeter and added a pound of fake flavor to it.  The Carmel frosting tasted more like coffee, which was confirmed later by my brother who tasted it and he is a human garbage disposal ...so for him to not enjoy the cupcake, was only confirmation.\n\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed nor satisfied when I left Gigi's.  I was actually pissed at the wasted calories because it SO wasn't worth it.  It would have been wiser for me to drive a few more miles down the road and head straight to polka dot where I have yet to be disappointed.",0.0,0.9960981607437134

(Yes, I'm going to use that adorable word.) We soon realized that their trademark involved loading a tower of frosting on to each and every cupcake. I'm not a fan of large amounts of frosting. I usually prefer a two to one ratio of cake to frosting, so seeing these heaping piles of luscious sugar atop each individual cupcake made me wince. \n\nHowever, they were all so beautiful I couldn't resist trying one! I got the pistachio cupcake with chocolate frosting on top and ended up throwing away 1/3 of the frosting. Their cupcakes aren't anything special, but neither are they complete crap. The product that really blew me away was their \""CHEESECAKE CUPCAKE\""! YES! Their cheesecake cupcakes are to die for! I had the Cookies & Cream cheesecake cupcake and it gave me a mouthgasm! \n\nI may be a foodie, but it's not often that I have mouthgasms, and this delicious cheesecake did just the trick! If I ever see another Gigi's again I'm going to avoid the cupcakes and go straight for the cheesecake. They might want to consider changing their name to \""Gigi's Cheesecake\"". \n\nP.S. The girl that worked here was very sweet and provided great customer service. She even admitted to taking off a good amount of the frosting before eating any of the cupcakes. You'd think that Gigi would listen to customers' remarks concerning the large amount of frosting, but then I guess they wouldn't be known for anything special...although I think the cheesecakes could become their new trademark.",0.0,0.9871425628662108

Going in \""for just a peek\"", we came out with two cupcakes and salivating profusely. The inside is spacious and airy with enough white and pink to seem whimsical. There are three display cases, each one having tempting delights. One is solely dedicated to Cake Bites - little bites of cake dipped in chocolate. Another case has Cupcakes and the last has an assortment of cookies, brownies, and bars. I am on a coconut kick and my eyes were immediately drawn to the three different types of coconut cupcakes they had - a Toasted Coconut, a Coconut Cream Pie, and a Pina-colada. Needless to say, I was torn. After asking the friendly gal behind the counter, I decided on the Pina-colada and the husband was generous enough to get the Coconut Cream Pie. Sorry Toasted Coconut - you'll be eaten on the next trip.\n\nSure, the husband complained that the frosting on top looked skimpy, but one bite and he forgot all about portion size. The cake is soft, moist, and super flavorful. For the Pina-colada, you taste the pineapple and the coconut in different dimensions. It's sweet, maybe a little too sweet, but so good you lick the plate and suck on the fork hoping to get that last bit of moist cake. The Coconut Cream Pie has both frosting on top and a filling inside. The inside filling was okay, nothing spectacular. Pina-colada definately won this round.\n\n***\n\nFour days later and we had to go back (since the sister-in-law was in town). This time we bought a half dozen for $13.50. We ordered 2 Pina-coladas, a Toasted Coconut, a Salted Carmel, an Oreo Cookie, and a double fudge. The Toasted Coconut was good, but I'd dare say the Pina-colada is better. I really enjoyed the Salted Carmel, but Husband thought maybe they should have done vanilla cake instead of chocolate (blasphemy!). Sister-in-law liked the Oreo but she'll eat anything Oreo flavored. The double fudge wasn't anything different than any other bakery - it was good, but I probably wouldn't order again.\n\nOverall, we would definitely go back - especially since every month they have new flavors. (Can we say pumpkin or eggnog cupcakes?) We won't abandon Urban Cookies and their Ollie Cakes, but this will be our little secret.",1.0,0.9828725457191468

It wasn't too dense and it wasn't too soft that you were left without the fulfilling substance.  It was just perfect.  It was a blueberry flavored cupcake and there were actually small blueberries in the cake.  The cake alone was divine.  It wasn't the consistency of a muffin, which you would expect for this particular flavor---it wasn't too sweet either.  It tasted like a pancake with a different texture...it was crazzzzy!!!\n\nThe icing was scary looking at first.  It has somewhat of a plastic foam look, so I was nervous.  It almost had the consistency of shaving cream but thicker...again, nervous.  But it was love at first bite.  It was the perfect completion to the cupcake.  It was maple flavored buttercream and there was even a small drizzle of syrup over the top.  It was not too sweet but not flavorless lard like some other places. The icing is very creamy and somewhat thick but not rich.  It was just a very well done cupcake.  It tasted like a blueberry pancake with syrup and whipped cream all wrapped up in one.  It was divine!!\n\nI was a little disappointed to hear that smallcakes is a franchise but I'll get over it.  I'll definitely be back.  There are not a ton of cupcakes on display but they do have 6 or so flavors to choose from....most of which are the \""usual\""...red velvet, chocolate, vanilla, lemon, etc.  \n\nI will be back because I want to try their yogurt as well.

I have tried the cookies and cream and the strawberry and both were very good, rich in flavor.  I think the only negative is that it leaves you wanting more.  They are delecate cupcakes and the icing is made with almond milk so it is light and airy in texture and flavor.  \n\nOverall,\nThese cupcakes are very good and well crafted.  They may not be the best option for the heavy-hitter dessert hogs.  This will likely leave you feeling a little unsatisfied.  It is like Edward and  the Cullens from Twilight.

To prove a point; the little cupcakes that Walmart sells--chocolate with buttercream on top?? They are from Walmart, mind you, nothing special, nothing for which I had great expectations, BUT as it turns out, comparing a GiGi's cupcake to those dorky mini Walmart proved to be disastrous for GiGi's: the Walmart cupcakes kicked GiGi's pretentious cupcake arse to the curb!! I bought 4 different cupcakes to try from GiGi's (which was 4 too many), I ate but merely a couple of bites of two of them (to be fair, before reviewing) and got so irritated by their dry, tasteless, dirty, cake-cardboard bluck and the waxy, thick frosting grossness, that I immediately googled this ridiculous chain and ended up here. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY & calories! Trust me, just say NO to Gigi's upChuck cakes. How in the world does someone screw up a cupcake?! Especially if a cupcake is your specialty and the ONLY THING you make? GiGi's is ALL smoke & mirrors. I might as well as eaten dirt.

I contemplated heading to a corporate cupcake place that shall not be named but I like to support local businesses so decided to give CC&C a try.  They had small and medium sized cakes and tarts ranging from $12-20+ and an array of baked deliciousness like cookies, brownies, and pastries.  They also had AMAZING wedding cake models in store that are custom orders.  \n\nWalking up they had a sandwich board sign saying \""cupcakes buy one, get one free\"" and inside there was a sign that said cupcakes were 2 for $5 so I asked to take all they had left which was 12 cupcakes.  My total bill came to $33 and I was very confused.  Cupcakes were BOGO free and the sign said 2 for $5 so I expected to pay $16 for the cupcakes.  The cashier explained that the cupcakes are normally priced $4.50-$5 so the BOGO and the 2 for $5 were the same thing.  Huh?  $5 for a cupcake?  I asked why there were 2 different signs indicating differently and his answer was \""I didn't want to have to redo the inside sign for the cupcakes.\""\n\nI ended up getting 6 of the only 3 flavors they had left, raspberry cake with vanilla frosting, vanilla cake with strawberry frosting, and almond cake with vanilla frosting.  This is where the whelmed comes in, they were ok.  Not great, not bad but just ok and definitely not worth $5.  I am not sure what kind of frosting they were topped with, it was lighter than a butter cream and closer to marshmallow fluff consistency.  \n\nI do want to go back and try some of their other baked goods because they looked amazing but definitely not going to be ordering cupcakes again unless I'm ready to just be whelmed.  So much for shopping local.",0.0,0.9964041709899902

I've tried cupcakes at a few other places in town... Freeds, Cupcakery, Gigi's, etc, and was always disappointed... until Showboy!! I bought a few different flavors to bring home to try out.  The first one we tried was The Big Top, kind of like rainbow sherbet... and it was really good... and I'm not usually a big fan of buttercream frosting, but this was yummy.  It really did remind me of rainbow sherbet, even that great smell!  So that was pretty good, so I was now looking forward to trying the rest... so then I tried a Pumpkin Spice cupcake... and WOW WOW WOW WOW... AMAZING, DELICIOUS, DIVINE!!!  For sure the BEST cupcake I've ever had!!  Moist, creamy, full of flavor but not gaggy sweet... absolutely PERFECT!!  That one cupcake alone put all others I've gotten at other places to shame!!  We will definitely be back for more of those soon!\nWe still have a Strawberry Bombshell and a couple of Red Carpet Red Velvet ones to try, but I'm sure we won't be disappointed!  There are some other flavors that I want to try, but they didn't have them today... more reasons to go back out there again!  Sadly, they aren't really that close to where I live... but after eating these so far, it's well worth the drive!!\nAnd of course Jared & Stephen were both great, very friendly & helpful and as it turns out, super talented!!\nI also hope to try a full-size cake one of these days, maybe special order a really cool custom cake!!

That, alone, is worth five stars.\n\nSo, thank you, Vanilla Pastry Studio.  \n\nAlso, while I'm yelping, I feel compelled to comment on the 1-star yelp review here.  Yelp can be silly, but finding a 1-star review for an independently owned, nice little cupcake shop that does good work, simply because the cake seemed dry / bland (and I'm assuming that this person only ate one cupcake, right?) is so sad it makes me fall into a deep, existential spiral.\n\nThere is a world beyond you, extreme cupcake critic.  In this world outside of you exists other human beings.  Many of those human beings don't know when or where their next meal is coming from.  If you are old enough to use a computer, you are far too old to stomp your feet and throw single star ratings at innocent cupcake shops.  Perhaps over your next indulgent and completely unnecessary food purchase you could contemplate how fortunate you are to have the ability to put food into your face and comment on it in any way.  \n\nPlease, yelpers.  Please... if you don't like something about your experience in a restaurant, cafe, shop, bar... tell the person who's waiting on you.  Tell a manager.  Tell someone, then and there.  Let them try to make it better. Maybe they will, maybe they won't... but try.  It helps to make our local businesses better, rather than diminishing them by giving low ratings.  Yelp should be a place for honest and open reviews, but it shouldn't be the one and only outlet for entitled and extremely passive aggressive people to let off some steam.",0.0,0.974292516708374

It's not that I have an extraordinary memory.  I just checked on Yelp.  They were first located in the West End.  Then Shadyside.  And now they are in Regent Square.  I love their new  store.  They have their own off street parking.  And the new store is very cute, lime green and pink are perfect together.\n\nMy review is for their cupcakes.  Although they are only a portion of their business, I think this is what they are best known for.  Sugar Fairy April Gruver is a master of wedding cakes and creative custom cakes. VPS is also known for using natural ingredients, quality chocolate and pure vanilla.  \n\nThere was a time when I thought these cupcakes were the best in the country.  However, either they have changed or my taste buds have changed.  Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy their cupcakes, but they fail to be the best.  Of the last flavors that I purchased, I found the chocolate cake of the double chocolate to be very dry.  The strawberry filled had very little strawberry, although the cake part of the cupcake was just about perfect.  The cake of the mango was much like eating a sponge and the icing was a bit tart.  Another disappointment, is the decorations.  Other bakeries that I have visited put a lot of attention in this detail and outshines VPS by a mile.  \n\nOther treats that we love, are their whoopie pies, chocolate truffle cookies and blondies.

It only took a second of arm-twisting for my boyfriend to convince me to go inside.  We were greeted with a table of ornately decorated chocolates and a case of cupcakes with frosting as big as the cake.\n\nThere were also samples of the ginger rose chocolates.  While we sampled, the owner, Amanda, was so nice and talked with us for about 15 minutes about her shop, her plan to introduce more cupcakes, and her chocolates.  Right now, she only has a few cupcake ingredients, but in a week, they're hoping to have a rotating schedule.  She uses real butter cream frosting and each cupcake is filled with a creamy pudding-like filling.  Sadly, I gave up cake for Lent, so I have to come back in a week to taste, but my first will be the peanut butter chocolate.  Or the mango peach.  Or the lemon lavender.  Or....\n\nWe did try more chocolates, though.  While we were there, only dark chocolate was available (no complaints here!) although Amanda does offer a selection of white and milk chocolates.  I got the cherry with dark chocolate and le-BF enjoyed a sea salt caramel with dark chocolate.  Amanda uses fair trade cocoa and natural, local ingredients.  They are so rich and satisfying, you only need one.  That's why the French eat like gluttons but are rail-thin - they use quality ingredients without waxes or fillers, so you're satisfied with one..although with all of her flavors, a small sampler box is probably worth it!\n\nDo yourself a favor and stop by.  This is definitely worth a trip to the Southside.

Yum.\n\nIn the evening, my friends and I shared the toasted coconut, salted caramel, orange creamsicle and s'mores cupcakes. I was majorly impressed. The only one that fell a little flat for me was the toasted coconut, and the only thing I'd change is a slightly less sweet frosting. As for the salted caramel, the chocolate cake part was the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I've ever had. The frosting, while very rich, was the perfect balance to the cake. The creamsicle ended up being our very favorite. The delicious citrusy cake balanced perfectly with the delicate cream frosting that had a touch of orange to it. It was wonderful. We also really enjoyed the s'mores. They used a frosting that seemed to be folded in with marshmallow fluff, and then dipped in ganache. The cake tasted like graham crackers, so the cake overall tasted just like a s'more. Awesome all around.\n\nI am impressed and will definitely be back. Sorry, Sprinkles...",1.0,0.9992542862892152

I definitely plan to make my way there during after hours for cupcakes.

Go you, Sprinkles!\n\nI got vanilla bean and salty caramel for ice cream flavors. They were both really good, though I had to cut the salty caramel bite with a vanilla bean bite to balance it out, but I knew that ahead of time which is why I got both flavors.\n\nThe cupcakes I got were vanilla milk chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, chocolate marshmallow, and cinnamon sugar. With each bite I took, I was in cupcake heaven. I think chocolate marshmallow is my favorite of the four, but I think I'll have to repeat this experiment further. You know, for science.\n\nTip: Double check what cupcake or ice cream flavors are available because not every flavor is available every day. As an example, orange cupcake is only available on Tuesdays.",1.0,0.998576521873474

I just went here on a friend's recommendation (and with a bunch of other people, but that's not so relevant).\n\nSprinkles is next to a plaza of sorts within the Linq. I think the easiest parking is probably the giant outdoor lot on Winnick Rd. off Koval, and when you walk through that end of the Linq, you'll get a good view of the giant ferris wheel. The store is pretty nicely decorated, brightly lit, and clean so far.\n\nAside from just following up on the recommendation, the crux of my visit was to capitalize on a sort of BOGO offer: buy a Cuban coffee cupcake ($3.75, standard price), whisper a secret passphrase (out of respect and because this is time-limited, I'll just say that it's on the national Sprinkles Facebook page), and get any other cupcake free. I chose dark chocolate on aforementioned friend's recommendation.\n\nFunny thing about a place named Sprinkles. They never asked me whether I wanted sprinkles on my cupcake. Only later did I learn that not only do the sprinkles not come by default (even though they're free), but the dark chocolate cupcake may be even better with the sprinkles, which are apparently more like flakes. Also, it seems that it's not the same person who takes your order as the one who takes payment, so I had to do that passphrase thing twice, which speaks to more communication issues.\n\nBut let's end this on a positive trend: if you have a sweet tooth, you will love these guys. Cuban coffee was delicious, with the coffee flavor concentrated in the lovely frosting. Dark chocolate was also great, and definitely not too sweet (at least in the non-sprinkle form). And I got to try a bit of a lemon cupcake which was just vibrant with flavor. Good times.",1.0,0.837128221988678

Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. \n\nI just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a \""Doggie Cupcake\"" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a \""Lemon Meringue\"" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. \n\nThere is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. \n\nHours:\nSunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am\nThursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am",1.0,0.9848951697349548

They have two different doors, one side for cupcakes and the other, for ice cream.  Every time I went, they had people standing outside, in attempt to answer questions/direct you into the right door. I like the concept but didn't like the execution. I was honestly a little intimidated. I felt like they were very nicely attacking me with flavor menus. It also felt a little awkward because I'm used to walking by a store front and going in on my own terms. I knew going to the Linq that Sprinkles was on my must try list but when I actually got there, I felt pressured to go in. \n\nAnyways, the ice cream is delicious. My first time there, they recommended the cookie ice cream sandwich. You order first, then wrap around to the other end, pay, and wait for the goods.  While I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice there were flies landing on the cookies/brownies sitting in the window they had. I'm by no means a germaphobe but felt very disgusted. I kept watching the flies to make sure they didn't go near the cookies I chose; and honestly, in my mind, they probably already have... I just didn't wanna admit it.\n\nEverything is a bit overpriced here but I expected that. I'm not a HUGE fan of cupcakes. I only tried a couple bites from my friends. Pretty good but their frosting is a little sweet. Totally biased on my end though... Lost my sweet tooth years ago.\n\nI hope this review doesn't garner hate or offend anyone.

Even busy, this place doesn't need 6 people behind the counter, their ordering and fulfillment process makes no sense.

Girl misprounced my name to get my attention, gave me correct flavor, on a plate, with no fork. After handing me plate, asked for my card. Awkwardly set it down, retrieved card, then had to reach again for my ID- for a four dollar purchase, after waiting nearly 10 minutes. Really?\n\nFinally snagged a seat to eat. Cupcake frosting was good. Cake itself was dry. Just because I ordered at 9PM should make no difference to the quality of your product. Cake texture and frosting texture didn't really work well together, due to the extreme dryness of the cake and the hardened frosting topping. \nOpted for a cake without sprinkles, wanting to get the cute circle symbol instead. When I ate it, I nearly chipped a tooth.\n\nGiven the low quality cupcake received dining in while they were still open (and busy), I'm hesitant to try the cupcake ATM.

It was also upsetting to see her cram 3 entirely different flavored cupcakes (Banana, Choc peanut butter & Strawberry shortcake) inside of a small plastic container then closing the lid smooshing them all together &  the frosting smashed against the sides & top of the plastic to go box. Over 9$ for 3 cupcakes to have them smashed into a box... The icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that the Strawberry Shortcake cupcake was awful. It had a terrible artificial strawberry taste & was so dry & insanely dense. So there was 3$...down the drain. Which could have been avoided if she would have let us sample before buying. In all honest, if I had sampled one before buying any, I would not have purchased (or even sampled)anything at all.

I can't imagine if it was a birthday party or something really special and they show up 5 hours late after everyone has left.  \n\nWe will continue to buy cupcakes from Cupcakes A Go Go in store, but I will never order delivery from them.  Unfortunately this event has left everyone in our office feeling the same way - unreliable delivery service.  \n\nVery disappointed with our experience today, but at least the cupcakes were still good.",0.0,0.9981355667114258

For $3.75, I expect something pretty good, and a lot of it.

I decided to try something different for breakfast, and give their cupcake a try.   I ordered the \""Oh, My Gosh\"" cupcake, which the girl suggested as one of their most popular cupcakes.  After grabbing a cup of coffee at Starbucks, I sat down and began to dissect my cupcake.   The vanilla cupcake was filled with a chocolate ganache, topped with chocolate and vanilla buttercream.   The cupcake was moist, but the cream was a tad bit dense and way too sweet.  I would have enjoyed it more with a beer, but the sweet cupcake didn't go so well with my caramel macchiato; way too much sugar to start the day!  The cream frosting was just too thick and heavy for my liking, and too sweet.  The cupcake was $3.75 plus tax, which came out to be $4.08...honestly since when do they start charging tax on cupcakes!?  \n\n For the price of the cupcake, I did not think it was worth $4.  I would have been better off going to Jean Phillipe or Payard and getting a sweet dessert or a pastry.   Other cupcake places like Sprinkles make better cupcakes than here, but so far I have not found too many cupcake shops on the strip in Vegas.   I guess if you have a cupcake craving these cupcakes might satisfy your appetite, but don't expect these cupcakes to be breathtaking delicious.  The cupcakes seem to be okay, they definitely have room for improvement, such as making the cupcake a tad less sweet.

If you open a business, charge a minimum of $2.50 a cupcake and someone is buying at full price 30 minutes before you close, you should be pretty happy.  I'm not complaining about the price - I know quality ingredients and no fillers cost more and make for a better product.  I'm saying other cupcake places taste the same, cost the same, and were friendlier.\n\nUpdate: I went back the following day and this time, the woman who I believe is the owner was very nice.

I would buy this cupcake again...\n\n-Strawberry Cupcake: I do love my fruity cupcakes but this one lacked a strong strawberry taste, this really just needs more strawberries and then all will be good with the world...\n\n-M&M's Cupcake: Thick vanilla cake topped with creamy vanilla frosting and then covered with M&M's. This was my daughter's pick and she said it was O.K. but she wouldn't choose this again so I tried it and I liked it so like everything else in life- it's one's personal preference...\n\n-Red Velvet Cupcake: Now this one tasted alot different than the rest. The cake tasted just like it came from a box cake mix . The frosting was a strong cream cheese frosting but still creamy.

I tried one cupcake (Chocolate Wasted) from this place before and enjoyed it.  However second time around trying these, weren't so good.  The presentation of these cupcakes are really good, however when you take a bite, it's another story.  \n\nReview on the cupcakes we had:\nChocolate Wasted:  The overall cupcake was delicious.  From the frosting to the actual cupcake.  And it was moist like a cupcake SHOULD be.\n\nRussian Climax:  Taste of the cupcake was okay, but it was falling apart as I ate it from being so dry.\n\nRed Dragon Cupcake:  I couldn't enjoy anything about this cupcake except the frosting.  I thought the Russian Climax was dry, but this was horrible!  It was almost like eating a scone.  \n\nI'm not sure why the cupcakes turned out dry.  I really wanted to love these new flavors I was trying, but I couldn't enjoy the cupcake.  As a local trying to recommend this from a guests, I'm really embarrassed.  This place has so many good reviews, but unfortunately I can't agree with all of them.  The only other positive experience was that my sister-in-law requested the cupcakes for 6pm delivery and they came 10 am.  A lot earlier than expected, but at least they weren't late.",0.0,0.9286497235298156

With limited time to do something special, I quickly had my son make a birthday card and I ran to Gigi's to get a few special birthday cupcakes for the occasion.\n\nSince my son isn't into chocolate, I selected a wedding cake (white) cupcake and a strawberry shortcake cupcake.  Both were piled high with beautiful frosting (my favorite part).  \n\nThe cupcakes did the job... they brought huge smiles and birthday wishes for my mom, dad, kids and nanny, and two cupcakes to share amongst all of us was plenty.  I recommend slicing these in half and sharing from there.  Those of us that are frosting fans enjoyed Gigi's most of all.  The cake part was fine but a tad on the dry side.  \n\nWhile there are cupcake competitors all around town (from local businesses and chains to cake pops and other sweet treats), you can never go wrong with a cupcake in my eyes -- no matter where it's from.

I like frosting that melts in your mouth and does not crunch.  If I had noticed the sugar sprinkles ahead of time, I probably would have changed my order.
