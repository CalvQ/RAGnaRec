I also like their black bean sauce, yam noodle packets, spices and spicy ramyun packets (Asian ramen that will blow your socks off). I recently picked up a couple of bread rolls with cream filling which is a Korean delicacy that satisfies your sweet and savory cravings.

American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves. It's pretty obvious by their name, they aren't trying to hide the fact they are Korean.\n\nI've been there for both Korean BBQ on the second floor and Korean food on the main floor.  I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh.(Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \""upscale.\""\n\nThey also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs.\n\nThe BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city. The staff is quite attentive and is pretty good about replacing the grills. I would prefer a different sahm-jang and more variety in the non-BBQ items in the buffet.

I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss.

After staging a bit of a hissy fit, they were able to find a place for us, and the adventure commenced.\n\nSo, having had Korean BBQ in both New York and San Francisco, I can't say that I thought this was the best experience. The kim chi selection is pretty limited when you're used to being plied with multiple little plates of different kinds of tasty kim chi. Here, they only give you the pickled cabbage. If you're looking for vegetables, this is not your place. You can take marinated bulgolgi, kalbi, pork, and chicken, plus there's calamari and shrimp for seafood eaters. The chicken was really tasty, but the rest of the selection was a bit bleh. As one of my friends put it, the bulgolgi from Trader Joe's is better than what we had here.\n\nIf you go, be nice to your tablemates and try to rotate the cooking duties. It's really lots of fun to go with friends and to have a communal experience, so even though I'm not sounding like I had a great time, the reality is that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed ourselves.

Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh.

We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.\n\nPro: average price korean food, large portion\n\nCons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch places\n\nHidden gem:\nYour meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae",0.0,0.9747819304466248

Another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in, they seemed to omit this with my takeout order.  Not a deal breaker or anything, but little details like this which would gain them another star.  The tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy.

The food is just so good, and the portions are so BIG even Adam Richmond would need a to-go box.\n\nNow I'm no expert, but this place seems really authentic. I've been to a number of Korean restaurants in southern Cali, and this place is one of the most \""Korean\"" that I've been to. Being on Dobson, it's right in the heart of the Asian community of Mesa. Smartly, they're not just another Asian food joint a mile up by Mekong palace and they're located right by MCC and the hospital right off both the US60 and the 101. Easily in contention for the best Korean in the Phoenix valley, Hodori is a must try for anyone in the metro area.",1.0,0.9998321533203124

Those familiar: no, they don't have the DIY grills -- it's served already cooked on a cast-iron hot-plate.  They offer in mild, medium, or hot.  The hot will get your attention, but I recommend going for medium and supplementing with the hot sauce they have at the table.  I swear they must lace that sauce with something-something because it's that awesome.  The food is all made to order by the one-woman-team, which means in a group, someone will get their food before someone else.  She doesn't make it all at once, and he doesn't wait until the whole order is ready.  Yet that signifies how freshly the food is prepared.  Service was prompt, courteous, and friendly, with the language barrier not really an issue.\n\nPlaces like this seem to be a rarity in Vegas, so I highly encourage local support.

(Note: This was also my first  Korean BBQ experience.  Thank you, Tofu Hut for being open super late to offer this!)\n\nThis is on the cheaper/lower end of the Korean BBQ spectrum that Spring Mountain offers, (IMO the higher end being Honey Pig, but that's another review altogether.) Their all you can eat specials really do it here with AYCE (13.99).  Tons of decent food with about 12 choices available of meat to cook, about eight side dishes, salad, a pretty rockin' tofu soup, and the whole thinly sliced meat combo.  \n\nMy only complaint is that there is no AYCE for one person, you need to have at least two.  :(\n\nThe staff here, as one review stated, is always flustered because they get huge groups of loud crowds that show up half drunk and the place ends up mobbed and they're unfortunately under-staffed.  The staff here is friendly and I get a kick out of the Korean programs they show on the television, which are usually karaoke or K-reality programs.  \n\nIf you go at night, particularly Friday or Saturday night, this is a hot spot for after-the-club crowd around 1/2/3AM.  So if you're looking for a quiet dinner, I don't recommend it on those particular nights.\n\nMy current favorite thing there is their tofu dumpling soup; spicy tofu soup with some hot dumplings simmering away in there.  Their spiciness level is pretty good, although I could do with a PINCH more for medium.  \n\nI also recommend their bibimbap in the clay bowl as that sucker stays hot for quite some time and you can take your time.",0.0,0.9733746647834778

It's been my go to place for Korean food, but my first time w their $16.99 ayce. \n\nStarted out rocky - it was half empty but we stood waiting to be seated for what felt like forever, while the frazzled server and busser both ignored us. There were a few other service issues to follow but sadly, authentic Asian places aren't known for great service. It is what it is. \n\nAnyway, food was great - decent selection of banchan (the sides), a surprisingly delish salad of romaine and cabbage mixed w a light dressing and I think kochujung sauce. We ordered bulgogi, kalbi short ribs, spicy chicken and spicy pork. The meat quality and marinade was really good, but I'm not a fan the marinade on pork and chicken. Both lacked flavor and the pork had really excessive fat and gristle. \n\nAlthough not included in ayce we got an order of the fried mandoo, which seemed to be homemade and a pretty generous portion. Also got the spicy tofu soup, which arrived boiling hot and yummy. Tried the steamed egg, which was incorrectly described as kind of a custard. It was more like a really fluffy omelette - seemed like a scrambled raw egg poured onto a little bit of boiling broth w green onion. Surprisingly good, must try.\n\nService was mediocre with just 1 poor guy running around and the busser girl who spoke no English - she just stared at us although I'm pretty sure coke is still coke in Spanish too. Things got better once one of the cooks came out to help wait tables, he was actually an awesome server. I'd suggest ordering everything at once while you have their attention, and you have to be pretty aggressive about flagging them down. \n\nSounds like a pretty bad experience, but it is probably my fav of the ayce k-bbq places over sura and woo che. Quality seemed better and a good selection of ban chan. The main negative compared to others is that they're not good about changing out the grill as the charred bits get stuck, but they probably would if you ask.

I needed both a place  that could fill my food standards and my hunger. I had heard a lot about Tofu Hut so decided to give it a try.\n\nOnce arriving at the restaurant, the server was very prompt in seating us and taking our order. The Banchan came out just a few moments after. Most were different from the other Korean Barbecue restaurants I have been to, but they were all very tasty.

It had the right amount of spicy and wasn't too overwhelming like others I have had before. \n\nThe meat was all very flavorful and delicious. We ate the brisket and marinated beef mostly. For all you Samgyeopsal (pork belly) lovers out there, I recommend ordering it marinated. It adds a little more flavor to the pork belly making it even more delicious. \n\nMy only complaint is that they did not have the usual dipping sauce that is served at most Korean Barbeque places. The sauce the did have was unique, but not my favorite.\n\nRecommendation: They have a special there from 10 pm - 2 am where you can get AYCE for $13.99, instead of the usual $16.99! I recommend going around that time to save a few dollars.",1.0,0.9967634677886964

I have many complaints about this place. So half of the restaurant is all u can eat the other half is sit in. So in total on the all u can eat side is about 8 tables. So first let me start with the side dishes. I am korean so i know my korean food and ive been to many korean restaurants. I have never been to a restaurant whose side dishes were so untasty. The kimchee was way to sour and salty and mushy. The odang was soo mushy that u couldn't even chew it. The korean pancake was way to hard. The clear noodles (chapchee) only had noodles and the only flavor in it was soy sauce. The only thing that was slightly edible was the cucumber. The meat they served was mediocre. It was edible but not delicious. They take FOREVER  to bring the meat. We would keep ordering meat when they would bring us a plate and by the time we got our next round of meat we had already finished the first portion and waited so long the grill got burned. The portions of meat was so small. We ordered galbi they brought us two slices and the slices half of it was just straight fat. They also dont use real galbi they use skirt part of the meat not short ribs. So they charge an extra 3 dollars just to include the galbi in the all u can eat and its not even real short ribs. So even though its the cheapest korean bbq around i will never return to this place i rather pay the 21.99 that everywhere else charges to have a better experience. This place just failed at every turn. Side dishes horrible, meat was mediocre, and service was horrible as well.",0.0,0.9996036887168884

Although the bbq smelled enticing, I was there for one reason and one reason only: sundubu. \n\nI ordered my go-to: the mushroom sundubu.  The menu described it as having 3 different kinds of mushrooms, but I can guarantee that I only saw 1 type in there.  The enoki and the oyster mushrooms were no where to be seen.  And on top of that I ordered \""medium\"" spice level, and there was no heat at all.  Nor was there any flavor.  I poured the entire kimchee side dish and some bulgogi into the soup in order to create an edible bowl.  Only after those measures, did I start to enjoy my sundubu.  However, it wasn't my original order.  \n\nMy husband seemed to enjoy his kimchi sundubu, but the \""spicy\"" level, tasted more \""medium\"".  So be warned, that you may have to order a higher spice level just to get some heat.  The bulgogi was very flavorful, and the banchan was not my favorite. My kids, however, devoured the korean pancakes, although they are a lot thicker than I am used to.  \n\nAnd I don't understand why almost every korean restaurant that we dine at, there is only one server.

When it's good, it's great. When it's not, it's not you get small pieces that look less than fresh. However, I've never gotten sick yet (cross fingers).\n       - Price - They're quite a bit cheaper than your average Korean BBQ place.\n**Price**\n       - $13.99 AYCE Lunch (Short ribs & Steamed Egg excluded)\n       - $16.99 AYCE Dinner\n**Ordered**\n       - Marinated Sliced Rib eye\n       - Brisket\n       - Beef Tongue\n       - Short Ribs\n       - Steamed Egg\n**Notes**\n       - Korean salad and side dishes are provided at the beginning of the meal.\n       - The rib eye and short ribs come marinated. They're quite flavorful, but I like to eat them alongside un-marinated meat.\n       - The brisket and beef tongue are un-marinated and you usually dip them in this sesame oil/salt concoction. If it tastes too plain and they didn't put enough salt, you can ask for more.\n       - The steamed egg, Korean salad, and side dishes make a nice non-meat compliment to the rest of the food.\n       - Sometimes the heat from the grill leans to one side of the table. If you're with one other person, then both of you can move to one side. If you have more, than someone's just screwed.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap Korean BBQ place or feel like rolling the dice.

The staff are very friendly, I like the one guy (I need to find out his name) who always tells jokes, he's the friendliest of them all. \n\nThe prices here are pretty decent, which is probably why they're pretty popular for AYCE KBBQ. $16.99 normally with a late night special of $13.99, but the late night special price doesn't include steamed egg or kalbi, if you want either of those you'll have to pay the regular price. \n\nThey bring out the meats as you order and you can only order a max of 3 items per table. Which they have a limited selection of meats, brisket, beef tongue, tripe, pork belly, kalbi, bulgogi, spicy chicken, and a few others. They pick and cut the meats how they want to and bring it out, sometimes I've noticed as I order the same dish, usually brisket and beef tongue, the sizes either get smaller and smaller or the quality of the meat decreases as well. \n\nRice and salad are included, but I usually wouldn't recommend the rice unless you're getting marinated meat, because you'll fill up on it and eat less meat. =] \n\nThey have an al la carte menu which is decent, I usually get it if I'm going in for lunch or late night and just want some tofu soup. They have a variety of tofu soup all at the same priced, slightly more than $8 each. It's a good deal, you also get rice with it. Just don't dump all the rice in at once, otherwise the soup will disappear very quickly!  Oh also, they put the egg in right when they bring it to the table. \n\nI've gotten the spicy chicken and bulgogi from the al la carte menu, don't really remember the pricing, but it wasn't too bad. A friend liked the al la carte menu better because it's cooked on a stove top so the meats retain more of their juices and she found it more flavorful. \n\nEverything you order comes with some side dishes, which include kimchi, seaweed, this type of fish thing (sorry I forgot the name), korean panakes, jap che, and a few others.",1.0,0.7993334531784058

For real. But you get what you can get and Tofu Hut is the place to get your Korean BBQ fix for a decent price.\n\nDuring their regular hours AYCE is $16.99, while late night (10 PM - 3 AM) is priced at $13.99. Not too shabby, considering you can get as much meat as you want. They offer a good variety - brisket, bulgogi (marinated beef), thick pork belly slices, tripe, squid, beef tongue and a few others. I'm a fan of the brisket, personally. You can't go wrong with ultra thin slices of beef dipped in their sesame oil/pepper sauce! The marinade on the bulgogi is decent, nothing to rave about. The pork belly is pretty fatty, just a warning. \n\nSide dishes are just as important to a Korean BBQ meal as the meat itself. There wasn't a lot of side dishes - kimchi, spicy cucumbers, japchae (stir-fried vermicelli noodles), fishcakes, steamed egg and a pre-dressed salad (essential for any Korean BBQ meal). This may sound like a lot, but really good BBQ places offer a lot more, probably twice as much. I was longing for some bean paste, maybe some garlic and jalapenos. Perhaps I'm asking for too much. After all, you get what you pay for. \n\nSo why the name 'Tofu Hut' when this place is popular for their Korean BBQ? Before the BBQ times, they once strictly sold a variety of soondubu (soft tofu stew). You can get this from not-so-spicy at all to ultra spicy, all depends on your taste buds. They still have this here and are decently priced. But why spend a near ten bucks on a mediocre soondubu dish if you can pay a few dollars more and eat like a king?",0.0,0.9341841340065002

There were 2 guys before us waiting for a table.\n\nWe got our ban chan which were pretty tasty. But their meat selections were pretty limited. We got the marinated rib eye, pork belly and brisket. There's an AYCE Korean BBQ place that has rib eye not too far away from TH and I like theirs better. So, I was a bit disappointed with TH's rib eye...it wasn't tasty for being marinated and it's not that tender. You can't go wrong with brisket since it's super quick to cook and it's good stuff. Pork belly - we kept ordering this. They have a limit of 4 orders and at least 2 people need to do AYCE. You mean, if I sleep eat they won't serve me anything? Well, booooo!!!",0.0,0.9961755275726318

We had decided on Tofu Hut, because of their AYCE option. Also, starting at 10pm, the AYCE is cheaper than normal during the day. It was kind of busy, and we ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes. The old korean ladies are never very pleasant or nice, they never smile. Whenever we ordered meat or food, they would give us a blank stare and walk off. Also, the salad was so bland and tasteless. Part of the korean BBQ experience is eating the yummy salad that comes with it! The salad had no flavor and it was really dry. It felt as if we were eating bunny food - ugh. Next, our grill was burning so much that the bottom started to burn. We thought that my boyfriend's pants were on fire at first and started to freak out. The bottom part of the grill had overheated or something, and there was so much smoke and it smelled of gas. We thought that it was going to blow up - might think im overexaggerating, but for ten seconds or so, we did. The old korean lady rushed over, took off our grill, then dumped ice on everything.

Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.\n\nFirst off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...\n\nI ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!\n\nI also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!\n\nAgain, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.

But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe name says it all: this is Korean (and Hawaiian and, coming up, Chinese/Korean) with island style.

And I left totally full.\n\nApparently they have just installed three high-intensity burners (they had just been inspected and approved that day), and they plan to do Chinese-style food too, like black noodles. They will also hand-make their own noodles.\n\nPity I don't live here; it would become a regular place for me.

You want the Korean menu, which has detailed descriptions of the dishes and photographs of most of the options, making it less intimidating for first-timers.\n\nI was pleased with everything we ordered including the delicious Korean seafood and scallion pancake, the noodle dish japchae, the BBQ pork and the bi bimbap, a personal favorite. One disappointment was that the selection of banchan or panchan - tiny dishes, often pickled served with the meal - was limited to just 2: tasty kimchi and pickled radish. At other places (of course I'm comparing to Atlanta) you get at least 4-5 different options or possibly more. Still, I can't complain since the main dishes and the banchan we were given were delicious and definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Korean food. I look forward to returning to China Wing and to visiting the other Korean restaurants in the area. I also look forward to visiting my favorite Korean spots back in Atlanta when we visit!

If they weren't from a bag of frozen dumplings from an Asian market then I have serious worries for the cook given that my first attempt at making homemade pork dumplings was light years ahead of what I got out of the dumplings here. Like I said, I can't help but think they were just frozen dumplings and for that I would avoid. I know this can sometimes be difficult when dumplings (otherwise a delicious nugget of goodness) are on the menu.\n\nService was great! We were in for lunch and although it was just us and another table the server were very attentive and didn't make us feel rushed. Food was prepared and served quickly as well.\n\nI feel like I might be stretching a bit at three stars but given the limited options for Korean in Charlotte I needed to give them the benefit of the doubt.

He was super nice and greeted us immediately. \n\nAs for the food...we got ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes), kimchi fried rice, and yukgaeyang (a spicy beef soup). There was a lack of side dishes that Korean restaurants are known for and the ones that came out were unimpressive (kimchi, fried sweet potatoes, and pickled radish). The ddukbokki was too mushy/overcooked and lacked the spicy taste that I was craving. I enjoyed the kimchi fried rice and the portion size was big. The yukgaeyang was decent.

I've had my fair share of tofu soups on both coasts, and the New Seoul tofu soup didn't even come close to the most basic of tofu soups I've had. The flavor of the soup itself was pretty good.

The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.\n\nWe ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  \n\nOut came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  \n\nOverall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  \n\nThis place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.

Given the fact that I am Korean myself - - when I  run into one of these people at a Korean establishment, the hatred is intensified.  Considering the fact that many patrons who frequent Kimchi are NOT Korean, one would hope that the owners would take more care to ensure that their waitstaff is up to par with any other good Vegas establishment.\n\nAnyhow - aside from this woman, Kimchi is a pretty decent Korean restaurant, open all night long, I think, and that can't be beat.  Just keep in mind - - if you go at 4 AM like I did on a Sunday morning, ask for the guy server and tell that woman that Grace said to keep her at least 10 feet away from your table at all times - and 20 feet away from the food.\n\nBanchan is decent and plentiful.... meat is good. The \""Al-Jjigae\"" and \""Yook Gae Jang\"" was also quite good.   \n\nI would give it four stars but I'm being awfully generous as I take off only one star for the wench.",1.0,0.9931083917617798

My bud got the gam-ja-tang(spicy potato pork soup) but said it was meh. \n\nOur server was bubbly and overall I enjoyed the food here. I will be back next time I'm in town.",0.0,0.8955754637718201

The meat was tasty and the whole meal was filling.  I could have and probably would have eaten more if there was more to be eaten but I did leave very satisfied.  Though, it should also be noted that I eat slightly more than the average bear.  Overall a great experience and I will be returning again.

The soup base had a strange sour taste to it and  ruined my appetite. The soft-tofu tasted better then my soup but still wasn't up to par.

Also, this restaurant had the type of bbq where you have raw meat and you grill it yourself on a huge grill in the center of the table.\n\nI have to say that my family and I were very, very hungry when we came here, and would probably think any food was good. But, we have tried several Korean BBQ and this was one of our favorites. I don't live in this area so I probably won't visit this place again, but I would if I came back.\n\nThe service was a bit lagging, since all they were required to do was bring a few slabs of raw meat to our table. \n\nWe ordered a tofu- ribs combination (sorry I don't know names) and 2 plates of meat: more specifically beef. We ordered one plate of delicious marinated ( Korean style bbq) tender beef and one plate of beef ( Chagol something or other.)\n\nMy whole family unanimously agreed that both types of beef were delicious, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the marinated beef if you were to get one type of beef. \n\nThe waitresses/ waiters give you a bowl of rice in the beginning, and the tofu was delicious with that. Now, as I said before, we ordered a tofu- ribs combination. The ribs were fantastic, some of the best I've had.

Mr. Tofu was closed and Tofu Hut looked really busy.  (I was only gonna go to Tofu Hut for SOONDUBU, NOT Korean BBQ!!!)\nHunnie Bunnie and I decided on DJK. \nSitting in the booths I really feel like I need a booster seat. The booths are SO low. \nHunnie Bunnie just wanted a bowl of noodles. I asked if they could replace the SARI (side of cold noodles) for UDON noodles instead since she won't eat much. They did not honor the request so I ordered the full portion, DOLSOT UDON, for her. \nI decided on the DWAEJI SUNDUBU (spicy soft tofu stew with pork). \nHB really enjoyed her udon noodles. I just picked out all the noodles for her into a smaller bowl and left all the other garnish in the big bowl. \nMy sundubu was decent. Spicy with small pieces of pork in it. I really prefer Mr. Tofu for all my soondubu needs though...\nI also find that the prices are a bit higher here than at other Korean restaurants. I probably wouldnt come back here unless I wanted one of the cold noodle dishes since I can't seem to find it at other spots - but definitely not just for soondubu or Korean BBQ.",0.0,0.8892048001289368

Normally the food is really good and the service is mediocre unless you are Korean (and mediocre is being generous).\n\nTonight, a group of us that work in the same kitchen on the strip went out together. We got there around 11pm and requested a table for 7-9 people as we weren't sure how many were showing up.  We were told it would be 15 minutes, as another part was almost finished and they needed to clean up, so we waited.\n\nWe were told our table was ready, and then no one showed us where it was. Being that it isn't a large restaurant, we found the table and sat down.  This is where it fell apart. We waited over 30 minutes to get menus, at which point I simply went to the front and asked for them. Shortly there after, our server showed up and her exact first words to us were \""Yeah what do you want?\""\n\nWe ordered 3 bbq dishes, japchae, 2 dumpling apps and she said \""this it?\"" and then scolded us for not having the full 9 (we had 6).  20 minutes later she brought out our side dishes and yelled at us for not being squeezed to one end of the table.  We proceeded to adjust seating to try and lessen the load on her (we figured that was what might be upsetting her, having 3 of the 5 occupied tables in the restaurant).  She brought out our food, threw some meat on the grill and we never saw her for the next hour.\n\nI cooked our food on the tabletop grill. I cut our meat, I served all of us the food that was cooked, and I even cleaned up and stacked the used dishes in the hopes she might notice and maybe take them, or refill our drinks.  Long after we had finished eating, she simply threw the check presenter onto the table and walked away.  4 of us fought over paying, all threw in cards, so I walked to the front and asked the split the $100 check four ways. She said no, said a few things in Korean that I wasn't able to understand (I do speak a bit), then told me she would only split in on two cards. \n\nAfter this experience, I will more than likely not be going back to DJK, despite their galbi being excellent.  I've never in my life had such a bad experience with a server, and I've been working as a chef for over 15 years (and have caused my share of servers to leave in tears/had them screaming at me in the middle of the kitchen).",0.0,0.9992904663085938

We expected the some milky-served in a bowl-with a ladel- goodness and we got a sealed commercial bottle. The wine itself was fine and a bit stronger than the wine at Hodori but I prefer the wine at Hodori. I like presentation.

We normally frequent other establishments but a while back, someone had told me about this place.  So by chance, we stumbled upon Chuhgajib.\n\nDuring our an hour and a half extravagant lunch, we were the only ones in there.  I normally try to stray away from barren restaurants but we were already spotted by the owner.  He had sat us down in a very artistic yet uncomfortable table and that's when our feast began~\n\n- Haemul Pa Jun [Seafood and Veggie Pancake]:  The haemul pa jun was delicious!  It had the most amazing dipping sauce and was quite a large dish.  I've had various kinds of kimchi pancakes at other Korean BBQ places but I think this place probably tops the cake with better dipping sauce.\n\n- Jap Chae [Stir-fried Glass Noodles with Vegetables]:  The jap chae was pretty standard.  It had a lot of vegetables and stayed insanely hot throughout our meal.  \n\n- Bulgogi [Marinated BBQ Beef]:  Like the jap chae, their bulgogi was pretty standard.  I did enjoy the sauce that they marinated the beef in.  It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection!\n\nOverall, Chuhgajib is a pretty nice place --- not my favorite but not too shabby!",1.0,0.9986757636070251

I've had all the dishes before and I have to say they were all very good! the kimchi pa jun was definitely the star of the meal for me. The bibambap was very good (I really liked that they included egg, not all places do), but I can definitely say that my favorite restaurant in LA had better, same with the daeji bulgogi (I actually think that Cafe Ga Hyang over on Olive and 43rd Ave had a better daeji bulgogi - more expensive but a lot more meat, and they didn't skimp on the sauce/marinade, which I felt they did here a little bit). They also didn't serve complimentary barley tea with the meal which was not a huge deal but I always enjoy having it with my Korean food. Price was very good too, only about $40 for a rather large amount of food. If we'd gone for lunch it would've been pretty cheap, from what I could see from their lunch specials, so I'll definitely be going back for that! Service was very quick, and I enjoyed the variety of Korean tv programs they had. \n\nAll in all, not comparing to food I've eaten in koreatown, it was a delicious filling meal and fulfilled my korean food craving and then some.

TRANSLATION: I think I know a little something about authentic and/or tasty Korean food.\n\nWe happened to be traveling to the north end of PHX once last month and thought we would try this restaurant for dinner.  BIG MISTAKE.\n\nOur biggest complaint is that the meals were too salty.  We had orders of ribs, bibim bap, and mushroom soon tofu.  Everything was TOO SALTY.  We got the soon tofu soup for the girls in the white (non-spicy) form.  A non-spicy format inherently makes it less salty, but my wife had to dilute it 1:1 (yes, equal volumes) with water to make it palatable.  We thought it might have been a fluke, but both the bibimbap and ribs were also too salty.  Our next complaint was that the service was very spotty.  Like in the Verizon commercial, we were wondering if any of the staff were there or could hear us.  This became an issue and was noticeable as we frequently needed more water and white rice (to eat the salty meal).  \n\nTHE GOOD.  We wondered why this place has received such high marks on Yelp.  We came up with 3 possibilities.  FIrst, price.  Their menu consists of many combo items (ie. ribs/soon tofu) which come with smaller portions and lower prices.  Second and third, lack of Korean restaurants in the area in association with patrons that want to experience some form of Korean food and don't know that they could do much better.",0.0,0.9970467686653136

Alas I only learned a few of her recipes before she passed and it's really hard to find what I need to make good old fashioned home cooking.\n\nSo instead I go to Chuhgajib Korean BBQ. It's a tiny place that has a homey feel right down to the TV playing bad Korean soap operas in the dining room. Most of the servers speak english but there are a couple who are harder to understand, it's called authenticity! At least you know the food is being made by, oh my gosh...Koreans!\n\nOk as for the food. My biggest test is always the tempura. Most Japanese restaurants in the valley have failed miserably at this, being too oily and heavy. Here the tempura is light, crispy and not at all greasy. Almost as good as grandmas, and I don't say that lightly folks!\n\nNext up is the quintessential dish Jap Chae. Glass noodles tossed with veggies a touch of meat and sauce. The jap chae served here is a little saucier than what I'm used to but delicious all the same! \n\nYou must try the BBQ, a big plate over propane in the middle of the table where you then sizzle big chunks of meat. Yum. The galbi is well marinated and boneless which is a nice touch, great flavor. All served up with crisp lettuce and sauce to wrap all the tastiness up in.\n\nMy only complaint is that the kimchi is a little weak on the spice. I can eat a whole dish and not feel my mouth warm up in the least. It's very good kimchi, not at all rank or sour like other places I've been. But if you are looking for spice you really must assure the servers you can handle it as they are a little wary of people asking for \""hot\"".\n\nAll in all this is a nice place to relax, grab a good meal that doesn't leave you feeling gross and stuffed.

And they were non-Koreans which was surprising to see. The waitress was Korean and sat us down at a table.

Decided to try this place out since it had the best Yelp ratings.  In the few months that I have been in the area, I have learned that Phoenix generally does not have very good Asian food, especially when compared to California or Las Vegas even.  With the lowered expectation in mind, this place wasn't half bad, but obviously not the best in the world.\n\nThe interior decoration of this restaurant was nice.  Very clean and traditional to a typical Korean shop.  Don't let the exterior, and random location, psych you out.  It'll feel much more homey once you step foot inside their facility.\n\nThe service was great as long as the place doesn't get too busy.  We got there a little early and the waiters were great to us in the beginning, but as soon as the tables started filling up, they stopped checking in on us so it took a little longer than we would have liked to get our waters refilled and to pay for the meal.  If you time your trips right, this shouldn't really be a problem at all.\n\nThe food was good enough to satisfy a craving, but I definitely miss Korean food from home.  The dishes here seem kind of generic.  It felt as if they just cut up some ingredients and threw it in pre-packaged store-bought seasoning and called it a day.  Definitely did not feel like a meal that the chef poured his/her heart into preparing for the guests.  As such, you would expect the pricing to be a little more reasonable than what they're charging.  $16 for so-so bubulgi.. come on!  I do give them props for the individualized clay pot rice bowls though.  Not too many places serve white rice that way, and I love fresh crunchy rice! :-D\n\nIn conclusion, would try this place again some day, but probably after I try some other places for comparison's sake.

The walk up counter staff was extremely friendly and fun and coached us through the differences between dishes. The man turned out to be the owner and a Vietnam Vet and we appreciate him taking time to chat with us.\n\nWe ordered Bee Bim Bop, labeled number 7 on the menu. At just $8.95 this is a great deal! The owner was accommodating when our friend wanted a tofu version and all three of us that tried it really loved the food. If I could change one thing I'd make this dish with marinated beef bulgogi, but I understand at this price that isn't ideal.\n\nThe pickled veggies that are served with Bee Bim Bop were homemade and very fresh. The quantity of food was enough to feed 1+ and more than expected. The hot rock bowl that it is served in continues to brown and cook the rice as you're eating, which makes for a pleasant, slightly crunchy texture.\n\nI always appreciate a restaurant that develops trusty regulars and this is that type of place. Their hours are mostly conducive to lunch (they close at 5pm) visitors. I recommend Man Na to anyone in Las Vegas who is open to a different atmosphere and dining experience, whether you like Korean food or not!",1.0,0.998555600643158

Here's why...\n\nMy husband has been stationed in S. Korea twice already (getting ready for a third time). I have been fortunate enough to visit him while he has been there and will again this 3rd time around. As a result of our Korean experiences we LOVE Korean food. Upon moving here, we asked around and was told Mother's was the place to go. \n\nWe went ... and we love the food... the first few times. However, our most recent visit (a week ago) may very well be our last.\n\nI usually order the bulgogi (my fav) and my husband has the bi bim bop (his fav). Our past experiences at Mothers were great- both dishes were always delicious and worth the price for the most part (see part about the lettuce charge)!  I was extremely happy that Mother's also had my favorite Korean beverage, beksaju. The side dishes had always been amazing and the server continously replenished a dish that went empty. \n\nHowever, during our last visit, I noticed immediately that the price of the bulgogi had increased to $24 for one person. Also, the bakseju had increased from $6 to $14. These bottles are pintsize in the first place and sale for only $3 at the nearby Chinese/Korean Grocery market down the street (near DKJ). \n\nTherefore, due to the increased price for my favorite dish, both my husband and I ordered the dolsot bibimbap. Another reason why I didn't order the bulgogi- past experience had been that we were charged $6 for the lettuce to eat with my bulgogi. Frankly to me, this was a rip-off. Bulgogi is supposed to be served with lettuce or spearmint leaves. The fact that I had to ask for it and then get charged was ridiculous. Another saddening thing- there were only 3 side dishes instead of the customary 5-6. When the food was finished, the side dishes were left empty.  \n\nBoth of us have felt that the quality and quantity of what you get has decreased while the price of what you pay has only gone up. Bad idea, especially given this economy that we live it. As a result, we will be very hesitant to recommend this place to anyone and will probably never go back ourselves.",0.0,0.9906833171844482

That was fine with us less work and  the food was cooked better than i could have.   The Bulgogi was  super yummy and i loved all the side dishes that it came with.

I am surprised I didn't see any roaches during my stay but the atmosphere is one that would certainly encourage such a visitor.  \n\nThe service was decent, not friendly but somewhat efficient I suppose.\n\nThe food was just not my thing.  Maybe I don't like \""authentic korean\"" but even the shrimp fried rice was gross.  The bbq was bland and there was nothing else we tried that was memorable.  I realize I am not an expert when it comes to Korean food but if this is the best Charlotte has to offer then either Charlotte needs more Korean restaurants or I can confidently say I don't enjoy Korean food.\n\nEither way, I wouldn't come back here.",0.0,0.9858111143112184

Let me lay it out for you - PePeRo is located in Matthews, near the intersection of John St/Monroe Rd and Hwy 51.  The entrance is located on the side of the building - there aren't a ton of parking spots but it's adequate.  When you enter, you'll be entering the market portion of PePeRo and off to the right of the entrance is the restaurant. The dining room is split into a couple different sections, I suspect from the effort to add on more dining tables. Usually, someone is there to greet you and show you to a table. It can get rather busy during peak dinner hours.\n\nThe menu is fairly straight forward - yaki mandoo, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, etc - and it comes with the traditional banchan (side dishes).  My faves are the yaki mandoo and the kimchi pancakes.  The bulgogi portion is generous and comes with white rice. My husband usually gets the kimchi tofu soup. I've also had the cold buckwheat noodles which is yummy on a hot day!\n\nI have to admit my favorite part about visiting PePeRo is the market - I can pick up a lot of my Asian favorites, not just Korean! I can pick up Japanese curry cubes, roasted seaweed packs, miso paste, Filipino sardines, sauces galore, as well as green tea, barley tea, and rice!   \n\nSo my two cents? Don't be intimidated to visit, there's usually someone who can help you out and direct you to what you're looking for.",1.0,0.9926453828811646

I noticed most of the bad reviews were for larger groups - there were 6 in our party, but again who cares about excuses.\nMaybe we should've known not to go since it was a Friday night and only 2 tables were taken out of probably 15. But the name is so cute and it had generally good reviews on yelp.\nSo we went, had some overpriced $12 soju (retail $3) and everyone got all you can eat. The guy wouldn't let me start w kalbi and spicy pork - said no do the brisket because it cooks faster. That wasn't a suggestion he wouldn't let me start with what I wanted. They brought out the sides,like 4 things - more regular kim chee, radish, some kind of fermented fish and these cute little pancakes. The selection sucked I asked for cucumber kim chee she said we don't have that, soy sauce potatoes \""we don't have that\"", more of the pancakes pls \""you only get one\"" WTF! \nBrisket is done and they bring out another pile of kim chee and bean sprouts to cook. Its pretty obvious they were trying to fill us up with the cheap sh*t. They brought out kalbi finally when it was done we asked for more and we were told it was 1 order per person, which it does say in the menu. I told him no there are 6 ppl and the amnt you brought out was serving for 2 or 3. I didnt say it but F*ck that. He went to the back and brought out more. Yay....\nI asked for shik-hye for the end of the meal \""we don't have that\"".\nEveryone on yelp said the best part was the fried rice they make on your grill. I was looking forward to this light at the end of a craptastic tunnel. The kim chee fried rice was ok, nothing special. We got the bill which wasn't itemized just a bunch of prices and a total, so we asked what everything was.  Those mofos charged us $4.95 x2 for that fried rice! Maybe this goes back to the not being Korean issue but I never saw a charge mentioned in any other reviews. \nWe paid and left w out leaving a tip. Not something any of us normally do, but that really was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I almost hoped they would come running out asking about a tip like I've read in other bad reviews on this place. \nMy suggestion - don't bother w honey pig! Go to woo che its in the same shopping center right off of spring mtn, its where we normally go for Korean bbq. Its cheaper, has other prepared food included, you pick what meat you want and cook what you want when you want it. Service is also very nice.

The kalguksu was nothing like I expected... the noodles seemed cheap and the seafood wasn't of great quality. Basically, it felt like I was eating instant noodle soup and not the authentic dish I had hoped for. The pork belly is a bit thick in a traditional Korean sense.... this dish usually comes out thinly sliced. \n\nThe best thing about this restaurant is its originality. They put the kimchi and bean sprouts right on the grill with your meat, and after you're done, they fry rice on top as a complimentary service. The kimchi is fantastic off the grill and was probably my favorite part of the meal :). I love that this restaurant is not super stingy with their rice and foods like some other places in Vegas. \n\nThe service was 5 stars. They were attentive, polite, and well-spoken.

Now, I'm from Los Angeles and I have had my fair share of delicious Korean BBQ from local restaurants there. When my boyfriend and I first entered Honey Pig, we felt a bit awkward since we were the only ones there. They quickly sat us down and handed us a menu which had some outrageously expensive prices much different from the $19.99 AYCE that they mentioned on the phone. After asking a few questions about it they finally gave us the AYCE menu. We did not have a choice on what we wanted to choose first , which was very different from the other places I've been to. They brought out small portions of Pork Belly (which was probably the best thing I ate there I might add) and brisket. \n\n-The unique thing about this place is that they actually cook the meat for you, which would be cool if they actually payed attention to the customers and how hot the grill actually is. Often times, the tongs were too far for us to reach so we had no way of actually flipping the meat ourselves and had to wait until one of the waitresses walked by. Lets just say I got used to eating overcooked meat that night.\n\n -Every time my boyfriend and I wanted to order more meat, we felt really uncomfortable because the waitresses made it very obvious that they were unhappy about it. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back here again for the AYCE.

We chose pork belly and kalbi, the most affordable options (I would have chosen those either way, because it's bomb)- anyway, they gave us two kalbi short ribs which I found to be fucking shitty. At least give us four. Most of the kalbi rib is bone, anyway. Theirs was tong kalbi. They should do a flanken cut instead to give the appearance of more food if they don't want to actually give more...food. Also, I think tong kalbi just confuses white people. (They don't know what to do with their hands.) And those scissors. Really, it stresses some people out. The ban chan is not bad. I liked the soup they gave us as well. \n\nYou could tell our waiter knew it was overpriced as well, he felt guilty so he ended up bringing us two shots of sochu. Without us complaining.\n\n I mean, we mentioned it was steep for two people...but we didn't go into full white people complaining mode.\n\nThis place isn't bad, though. But, two stars means \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" Which I have.\n\nI'll give this place another shot when I'm chasing the Korean dragon HARD, and need my direct injection of gochujang. \n\n\nCHARLOTTE, WHERE IS YOUR KOREAN BBQ FOR THE LOVE OF COD?!",0.0,0.9913740754127502

I really did, but alas, it was not meant to be.\n\nTruth be told I wanted to try Kim's, but being broke and on a card only budget (sad, I know) this was the place for me... I figured Korean can't go that wrong, and I craved it, so off we went.\n\nFor a starter I had the Ddouk Bok Yi, which I actually really liked, so there was definitely some hope... the Korean rice cakes were a bit bigger than I was used to, and the fish cakes a bit fishier than I was used to, but the sauce was right and it still worked as a dish... I would order it again here.  \n\nThe mains were a step in the wrong direction however... the Bul Go Ki (Beef) was nearly plain in the taste and a definite let down... the Oh Sam Bul Go Ki (Spicy Squid and Pork) was a bit better, but still not a must have in contrast to similar dishes I've had elsewhere.  On that note, one of the things I really like about Korean cuisine is that it hasn't stabilised into the land of generic as of yet... I expect each Korean place I end up in to be different to the last, so that has been taken into consideration for this review and I still walked away a bit underwhelmed.\n\nThere are positive notes however, in that rice and salad leaves came with the bulgogi versus having to be ordered separately, but that's certainly not enough to tempt me to order the same dishes here again.  Oddly kimchi itself was a separate order at \u00a34.00, but they at least gave you a slight assortment of Korean pickles (I forget the proper name) for free with the meal.\n\nThe place itself is as others have mentioned is downstairs and looks to need a smidge of TLC... the men's bathroom for instance has one of those taps that isn't really fixed to the sink any longer, not really what I would expect at a restaurant.  It was also easy to just show up and get a table on a Saturday night, which can be viewed as good or bad depending on how you look at it.\n\nI'll go with three stars because in the end we both finished our meals, and it wasn't terrible, but I didn't have my \""wow, this (insert dishes name) is really good here... I think I like it better than at (insert other Korean restaurant's name).\""  While my starter was suitable, it didn't convince me that this was the place I need to get back to for my Korean food fix...

We started cooking some of the short ribs but we felt rushed because the server kept asking us to add more meat and turn them over when they started to change color. We found that extremely annoying because I thought the point of eating Korean BBQ is so that we can cook it ourselves at OUR pace. It didn't taste as I expected because the marinade was rather mediocre.\n\nThe pancake was super thick due to excessive batter and too little seafood. That was perhaps the last thing I need after the rice, soup, and oily kalbi that pretty much filled me up. I like mine thin, light and with lots of seafood. The bi bim bap wasn't that impressive either. My friend hardly had any of it. \n\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed with La Maison Bulgogi.

I can't recall a korean bbq place in LA with chicken and seafood.  They supposedly also have scallops on some nights.  The place is nice inside with good ventilation and temps despite the grilling going on.  You can choose from several basic korean banchen including kim chi, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and some dried shrimp mixture.  For raw foods to be grilled, you have a few types of beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and squid.  They also have some sushi and chinese dishes including steam buns with bbq pork.  For dessert, they had an assortment of fruit to choose from.\n\nI tried about four of the side dishes and liked all of them except the dried shrimp one that seemed way too crunchy in texture to be edible.  The kimchee was  remarkably good and packed a lot of spice.  The server places your raw meat on the grill and you do the rest.  Not being a big beef eater, I chose only the pork, chicken, shrimp, and squid.  The pork and chicken were already well marinated in some homemade hot sauce.   Wow- the pork came out really flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness.  Thumbs up for the homemade red sauce!  The chicken and squid both came out really well also.   I wasn't so lucky with the shrimp because I overcooked them.  They also had previously grilled yellowtail and makerel fish but they were a disappointment because they were all overcooked and too dry to eat.   The steamed buns with bbq pork were suprisingly good and on par with those we had for dim sum earlier. However, the sushi wasn't that good.  Besides the kim chi and spicy pork, the other highlight of the meal was the amazingly sweet honey dew : ) .  I would have been impressed to see the kim chi and spicy pork they had here at any restaurant so I'm doubly impressed that you can get it at a buffet in Vegas.  They really should open a place in LA . . .",1.0,0.996719777584076

The kalbi is good too, but it comes with bones and is difficult to eat with chopsticks. They also have all the available small dishes like kimchee, marianted cucumber, noodles, mung beans and other korean delights. Also to finish off there is this ginger drink in the dessert section.

This setting proves to be convenient, but potentially risky.  We came at prime dinner time, so the meats rotated quickly and didn't sit out too long.  There are also a wide selection of appetizers, including various vegetable tempura, sushi rolls, soups, etc.  There are two large pots of rice, one of regular long-grain white rice and the other of sticky red bean rice.  There are also canned peaches, fresh oranges, and different types of jello for dessert.  \n\nThe service was very good.  I never had an empty glass on my hand.

HOWEVER, after trying this place, truthfully, I wasn't really impressed. In fact, after all the good, positive feedback given to me by my friends, I was really disappointed for my first time here.\n\nThe food was decent: I liked the Kal bi, it was sweet and delicious because it was marinated just right.. Though, the side dishes were subpar compared to other korean joints I've tried and the desserts are- what desserts? We were sorely disappointed that there weren't any ice cream here. Though, I forgave them because their fried, sweet potatoes with sesame seeds were absolutely delicious! But that's really all the dessert they had here. Not even a selection of cakes or cookies. If you're a fruit person, there were some peaches and oranges but that's about it. \nI was also a little bit put off when they served their hot tea on a tall  PLASTIC cup. Really? That was the first time I've ever encountered that in a restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere? I hated it.. I felt stifled with the dim, crowded, music-less atmosphere, and it wasn't the friendly, fun kinda atmosphere that you would expect. I would expect this on a weekend but on a Tuesday evening? \n\nThe servers were the deal breaker for me: There were plenty of them but not one of them smiled or even looked at us. Each one of them looked like they were in a hurry or too engrossed with their jobs to be bothered. They could've asked us if we were doing okay at one point, even when our meats were burning. Maybe communicating is hard for them but the least they can do is try. I'm not paying $24.95 just for the food. I'm also expecting good service if I'm paying this much. After eating, it seemed like the server wanted us to leave as fast as possible. Which we were very unhappy about. \n\nFor the price we paid for this place, I don't think it was worth every penny. I could've picked a random Korean restaurant and the food, atmosphere and service would've been much better compared to this place. \n\nThis place actually deserves 1 star, but because they had several meat and seafood variety, I added one more star. Maybe in the future, my experience here will be better in which case I'll write another review and rate it better but I really don't think I'll be eating here anytime soon. Trust me, you'll get your money's worth eating at a different Korean restaurant.",0.0,0.9627527594566344

I'm from Los Angeles and was hoping the korean bbq would be similiar to those from L.A.   I was wrong.  \n\nFirst, we went on a holiday weekend (saturday night), and the place was empty.  A waitress led us to a table where we can cook our own meat.   She explained that \""red\"" items on the menu will be brought out automatically, but the \""black\"" items on the menu would have to be ordered.  We asked for the garlic endamame and spicy tuna roll.  I will admit that that spicy tuna roll had a lot less rice than other AYCE sushi places - but that's because we weren't having AYCE sushi, but AYCE korean bbq.  /shrug\n\nThe waitress checked on us frequently, but everything about her was fake and it was obvious she was just going through the motions and didn't care at all.  To prove this point, our waitress took orders for 3 different types of meat (bulgogi, kalbi and cow's tongue).  She brought out the bulgogi first and while others have wrote that the staff cooked the meat for them, we had to cook our own.  She would come by from time to time and toss the meats around, but left the cooking to us.  After bulgogi and kalbi, our grill was completely crusted from the marinations from the meat.  At this time, the waitress forgot that she didn't bring out the other meat and brought it out only to dump it on top of the crusted grill - note:  cow's tongue is unmarinated and she completely ruined the flavor of it.   We didn't have a chance to ask for more meat cuz all she wanted to do was turn off the grill and be done with us.  We were the only patrons - you'd think they would try to please their only customer rather than shooing them out the door.\n\nOverall, I would never go back.

I was looking for somewhere to take my fiance out for his birthday and stumbled upon this Korean restaurant on Yelp. I called and made a reservation for a table with the tabletop grill. When we got there we found that he had given our table away, although he apologized I was still annoyed and we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes or so (Why even make a reservation?!). Being from California I have been to my share of table top cooking Korean restaurants and they usually have the large rectangular grill that you can put lots of meat on at once. Red Kimchi had a small round grill that seemed to cook unevenly. I asked for a Thai Iced tea and the waiter stated that it wasn't good and I shouldn't order it and I awkwardly said..ummm...ok nevermind. So we order the Galbi short ribs and the spicy Korean pork. The waiter (who I think was the owner) came back with the raw meat and explained that he goes out himself to select the best angus beef for his short ribs. That was a nice little story and the meat was very good quality. I must say the portion was very small for the price paid, $20 for 3 pieces of short ribs. This is not usually the case when I have gone to my Korean BBQ spots in California but this is Arizona and there aren't many Korean restaurants around. The spicy pork was very good and the portion was decent. The restaurants I've been to in the past usually have a lot of kimchi and appetizer sides don't know the proper name) and I was hoping for those cold clear noodles, but it never came. We just got a couple of mediocre pickled items (maybe 3 or 4) and some kimchi lettuce. They did bring out a nice little dessert for his birthday which was yummy. The thing I love the most about going to Korean restaurants with tabletop grills is the fun of cooking it. I didn't get to do any cooking because the waiter popped in every two minutes to snatch the tongs and mess with our food, which is fine if I didn't want to do it.

I was also impressed with the kimchis and loved how they came in the self serve stone pots.  This is definitely my new korean soup spot!",1.0,0.999537467956543

Even if Vegas winter is a nice 65 degrees.\n\nThis time around, I had ordered the Haejangguk (Hangover Soup $8.95). The broth is piping hot and rich. The cabbage, leeks, and bean sprouts are plentiful. The beef was on the dry side. I wished they put the clotted blood cakes into the dish, but I am guessing that is what they blacked out on the menu and board. The soup was good enough to get three stars from me, but it was the kimchi that has me at a four. The pot of cabbage kimchi is the best I have had in Vegas. Other places skimp on the red  pepper mixture leaving theirs bland, sometimes sweet, and lacking of flavor. Not at E-Jo. They do it right by opening each leaf and spreading in this magical combination. It is a tedious process, but that's how good kimchi is made. By clean up time, I had ate the whole pot with the exception of two leaves. The radish kimchi was not my favorite.

The side dishes are a little skimpy even for two people and if you want extra you have to pay more, as opposed to most restaurants in South Korea which mostly gave you unlimited side dishes, and 2. they don't let you do the grilling. You order it and they cook it like most American restaurants do, which is disappointing if that's what you are looking for.

I still frequent their sister restaurant Oyshi Sushi just a few doors over. Truth be told, I'm still so much into Oyshi(I just went again yesterday!) I hadn't bothered to try Soyo til I got dragged here lol. It's not a really large place, very casual. I'm guessing the interior was made to resemble more of a typical korean drinking spot? I say guessing since I've never experienced the korean drinking scene but the style seemed to be aiming for something to that effect.\nThey serve boricha, a corn tea that's common in korean cuisine. Instead of cups there's small metal(copper?) bowls to drink from. It's a slightly bitter tea but it complements alot of the spicy and savory korean foods.\nThe menu was pretty good in describing the various items for people who might not be as familiar with korean food. We're korean and grew up on korean food, so not necessary for us lol. Prices looked reasonable. This might be considered more of a drinking spot, but no one in our party drank, so I can't vouch for their spirits. But nothing definitely wrong with just coming to eat the food. I'm sure nobody here will scold you or call the food police!\nThere was 2 waitresses and they were good at keeping the side dishes and tea refilled and whatever else we needed.\nThe side dishes were decent. The only one that was kinda puzzling. It was shaved radish with mayo and I could taste a bit of egg. My best guess is a radish version of potato/macaroni salad? I ordered the spicy rice cake, it was fiery n delicious. If you don't have a high tolerance of spicy you might want to ask for this mild or try something else. Also had their version of hot wings with sauce made with korean chili paste(not overly spicy). There was kimchi fried rice & spicy tofu stew that I didn't try but was told were pretty good too.

Yep, it's Chris the Korean BBQ newbie.  Here, let me share some of this salt for you to take with my review...\n\nHaving never experienced Korean BBQ before I was a little hesitant but I do enjoy trying new things from different cultures (within reason).  This visit I had the Dol Sot Bi Bim Baap...aka the number 6 :-)  I enjoyed the meal except for the crispy seaweed strips that adorned the top of the bowl.  I know, I know...it's the way it should taste but every time I taste seaweed anything it reminds me (sorely) of being tossed upside down at the Jersey shore and coming up with a mouth full of water.  The rest of the bowl was quite nice but really didn't knock my socks off in the flavor department.  It wasn't flavorful or spicy or all that complex of a taste...kind of all ran together, taste-wise. Maybe there's something such as a sauce I should have added to the bowl?\n\nService was excellent.  I swear 4 different people came to the table to ensure everything was up to snuff.  Maybe that's how it always is, maybe it's because they could sense the fear in the white boys eyes.  Whatever the reason, I dig it.  I hope to return again soon so that I can try something the regulars suggest that may have a little more flavor to the dish.\n\np.s.

That's a hard dish to find in this town, and they do it pretty well except that it's a bit too spicy for me, and that the veggies aren't as crisp as I would have liked.\n\nI will continue to come here.

The place isn't huge, but they definitely try to use up as much space as possible. My favorite dishes are the garlic chicken wings, tofu soup and corn cheese. The ban chan choices here change periodically - just last night, they had a side dish of this really tender, marinated beef that was really mouth-watering. They do get really busy here, so at times there can be a long wait. I've seen so many different types of people here, which I think goes to show that Soyo is a crowd pleaser. Just last night, I saw the parents of two newborns dining here, so you know the food must be good if they're willing to go out of their way to eat here. They give you barley tea in a tin bowl as soon as you are seated, but hot tea and iced water are available as well.

It's a savory and not-too-salty broth with an herbal tone filled with tasty vegetables, chunks of chicken and dangmyeon (sweet potato noodles). I could probably live without hot dogs. Although they use 100% premium beef franks, I still get a sick feeling after eating one. It's either guilt or nitrates eating away at my soul.

Sweet potato fries topped with spicy pork, fried kimchi, an egg and other goodies. It sounds like an artery blocker because it is.

My BFF is obsessed with Korean culture and just recently got me to try it.  To my shock and awe, I actually like it (I'm the pickiest eater ever and eat nothing but chicken fingers & mashed potatoes).  So, with the discovery of Korean BBQ, we, with a group of friends, decided to go to Lee's.  \n\nFirst of all, before you even think about getting the all you can eat BBQ, everyone at the table has to agree to it.  The dinner pricing for AYCE is $29.99, which isn't absolutely terrible but still a lot to pay for one meal/per person.  They really do let you keep it coming.  The food itself wasn't bad at all.  We got pork belly, pork shoulder, bulgogi and a variety of other things and, of course, it comes with the normal spread of traditional Korean eats like kimchi.  What I like about Korean BBQ is that I can cook it myself for as long as I want (I like my meats a little burned - I know, I'm a weirdo.)\n\nAnyway, like I said, the food was good.  However, this place is only getting 3 stars because the service was awful.  Our waitress looked like we were wasting her time.  She really couldn't give two shits about us & the fact that we were all paying $30 each to eat (which is a lot for one meal/per person!!).  We repeatedly asked for drinks that were never delivered.  When she would pass our table, we would say 'excuse me' in English & Korean (we had a few people that could speak a bit of Korean with us) and she completely ignored us until she decided it was time to check on the table.  She got super pissed when we asked for the beer that she never delivered.  & then we sat for probably close to 30 minutes waiting for the check and finally had to ask a different server for it.  \n\nAs I re-read this whole review, I feel like downgrading a star but I'll leave it at 3 since the food was good.  But man... they really need to get some servers who can at least pretend like they care about the customers.  Next time we want Korean BBQ, we are going to Tofu Hut!",0.0,0.989616870880127

At first I was so excited to finally have Korean food in North Las Vegas that it was love at first sight!

I've had the Korean pancake, sundubu, kimchi jjigae and their dumpling soup (mandu duk guk?).  By far my favorite dish is the dumpling soup!  Everything else is decent, but I've had better versions of each dish elsewhere.  The dumplings in this soup are large and filled with meat and veggies, there are lots of rice cakes in the soup, and the broth is very tasty; it seems that other versions I've had don't have as flavorful of a broth as here.\n\nI'm glad that this spot opened up, since it's a great change from all the other chains along Craig Road.  With banchan, you get a good sized lunch for under $10.  If you're planning on going around 12pm-1pm though, be sure to block out at least a full hour.

For the last 2 years, the Jun's located off Eastern Avenue has been a meet up spot for me and one of my good friends. She loves Jun's and if I knew there was one north, I'd have HER come up. Probably doesn't matter anyway. She has lived here for the past 10 years and driving 15 miles away is considered far.  For me coming from California, driving 30 minutes for dinner or to meet friends is normal. Probably a moot point anyway because I would have to drive to see her anyway. \n\nWell anyways, I've been a fan of Jun's since my first visit a couple of years ago.  This location is just as good.  But this time I changed it up, just a little. My normal order at Jun's is their Grilled BBQ Chicken.  This restaurant gets it right every time and regardless of which Jun's I go to, it's still made the way I like it.  If you haven't tried their BBQ Chicken, you're missing out.  It's about 8 oz of the most tastiest chicken one could ever want.  I even double the order when I really am striving for more protein.  I also got their Chicken Katsu, which was just okay.  Jun's really hooks up the Katsu.  It's almost double in size compared against other Hawaiian/Japanese Restaurants.  Only issue, it was a bit bland.  Good presentation, but lacking taste in the chicken.  I found this ironic since their BBQ chicken is the bomb. \n\nOverall, I'm just excited that I found this place. I have to thank Yelp for this. I was at a stoplight in Summerlin and wanted to know the distance to Jun's.  To my surprise, two locations showed up with this one towards home.  Tonight was just my first of many visits to come.

However, if you are more familiar with the flavors and selection that ordering \""Korean BBQ\"" provides, then you will be met with great disappointment ordering this at this establishment. We ordered at least one round of every meat available (Bulgogi, beef brisket, pork shoulder, pork belly, spicy chicken, spicy pork). The only acceptable tasting meat was the Bulgogi. Everything else was a struggle to finish, and not because we were not hungry. The pork shoulder and belly were presented cut too thick for a traditional k-BBQ presentation. The spicy marinade for the chicken and pork was very bland. The brisket was also too tough to even cut with the cheap cutlery provided. The two possibilities here are that either 1) the cook simply over cooked everything to a complete crisp (we were not allowed to cook the meat on the teppan grill ourselves) or 2) the meat was purchased from the Fry's next door and literally taken out of the freezer and thrown onto the grill without marinade (and then still over cooked). I'm leaning towards the latter. Even with the bulgogi, the marinade tasted like it was not prepared fresh; it tasted like the pre prepared marinade available for purchase at the local Asian supermarket. Oh, and frustratingly, you are slapped with a long list of rules to follow (I e two hour limit, no leftovers or you pay $15, etc) while they try to stuff you with \""free salad\"" and a pathetic excuse for a kimchi pancake before slowly and begrudgingly bringing the meat out. Honestly for the price of $21+ per person, with the flavors and quality of the meat, this is not worth it. In fact as I write this review, I'm inclined to say even for the casual consumer this place is not worth it for korean BBQ.\n\nAgain, I write commenting only on their all you can eat BBQ, without having tried their sushi or anything else. \n\nFor good korean BBQ in Arizona, try Takamatsu.",0.0,0.9996988773345948

Then, eating the (beautifully plated) bibimbop, I again became very aware that every bite was coating my mouth and lips with oil. Not the most appetizing.

There is no doubt everyone makes their kimchi differently. However this kimchi didn't even taste pickled (which is kind of what kimchi is-spicy, pickled, cabbage or bok choy). It just tasted like someone slapped red pepper and sriracha on some cabbage. \n\nOverall the service was okay and when I looked around I saw most people were only there to drink not to eat.

We were quickly seated in the modern looking space.\n\nThe menu was interesting - they had the standard combo items, where you get a mix of meat and sides, but apparently when we were there it was happy hour, and they had items that were priced in the $3 to $8 so that you'd order a serving of beef toro, spicy pork, sides, etc  - almost felt like a tapas place, though obviously meat heavy.\n\nQuality of the meat seemed a little better than Sura.  We were a little surprised that the kalbi/short-ribs had the bones removed, but that was fine.  All the meat and sides we had were good, and the gas grill worked fine.  I was also glad to see that they had spicy cucumber as a side, which is one of my favorite forms of kimchi.\n\nThe small plate style of ordering probably kept us from over-eating as much as an AYCE joint, but I was feeling nearly as full.\n\nThe one miss we had was that we had ordered white rice, but it didn't come out till we were almost done (which had included a second round of ordering).  I had asked about it earlier to one of the staff, and they nodded, and wandered away like they were on it, but didn't bring out any rice.  My guess is that they had gotten slammed at some point, and ran out of rice, so they had to make more, but that's only a guess.

No kimchi, no lettuce, none of the usual Korean sauces for your meat. We did get three sauces-ponzu, glazed sauce, and a somewhat spicy sauce. It wasn't terrible but without my banchan, there was something lacking for sure. Yes, I realize it's not a traditional KBBQ restaurant-some Korean/Japanese BBQ fusion. The service was good though. The restaurant is modern, clean, and trendy but that's not enough for me to come back.",0.0,0.9695039987564088

More than half of mains were something with kimchi, so if you don't like fermented cabbage you're in trouble! \n\nWe had a pork and kimchi with rice and a beef bibimbap, with a side of kimchi. The pork was ok but may not have actually been belly. Not much meat either....My bibimbap stone bowl was so hot that over 20 minutes after it was put in front of me it was CONSTANTLY still cooking everythin in the bowl. Consequently the rice at the bottom was stuck to the bottom an inch thru and essentially all burned. It was 3 chilli spicy, apparently, but not AT ALL SPICY. I mixed the tiny amount of veg and egg yolk with the rice an ended upwith a stodgy, burned, tasteless, mess of a dish. I craved a pot of broth to add or something....4 shreds of beef and adding some of the kimchi side improved it marginally but i left almost alll of it as it was inedible and completely unappetising. \n\nNo one asked if our meal was ok.

Rice quality was mediocre.\n\nThe spinach namul small plate was $6 and I seriously only received 2-3 tablespoons.\n\nFor $12-$13 entrees you should expect much more decent quality in Madison.  I didn't try the galbijjim (fancier short rib) or the jigaes (stews).. I might give this place a second chance and try one of them.. or the bibimbap.. but it's really hard to mess up bibimbap... \n\nService was very friendly and decently attentive considering the place is fairly new... too bad the food wasn't better...\n\nOverall this is very \""home-style\"" (nothing fancy) Korean food that is mediocre and overpriced in an atmosphere that doesn't quite fit.  They're new.. so maybe if the food improved in the coming weeks and prices went down a bit I'd give them another chance.  Maybe if I were here for lunch and had paid less I'd feel a bit better but the food was still weak regardless. For now if you want Korean food in Madison, New Seoul is better... or learn to cook Korean food at home... or drive to Chicago...",0.0,0.9983537197113036

Sol's is a place to go to to get some good food, but you need to come with some precautions.\n\nBoth times I went, I had the same two dishes:  A cold spicy tofu, and the bibambop (sp?).  I think both ware very enjoyable if it's the kind of thing you're into.  The tofu was really hot, but the sauce it was covered in had a lot of flavor, so it was a good experience, but not for everyone.  The bibambop had a good melding of flavors that gave the dish a good texture, and the second time I went (but not the first), it had some good flavors as well..  My friend had a dish that was like sushi, but had some small differences.  He enjoyed it, and for what he paid it seemed well worth the price. My other friends had a sweet potato noodle small plate, and they both claimed to like it.\n\nSo, yes, the food is good, but that's not the entirety of a restaurant.  Service wise, they're fine, but could be better.  We got all of our food in a timely manner, the servers were nice, and they filled up my water often, but they were lacking in knowledge about what their dishes contain, which is a real problem.  This is a real problem because both times I went there, I ended up getting beef in my bibambop, and both times I requested it vegetarian.  The first time, I just said that I wanted it \""vegetarian\"", and they ignored that.  The second time, I specifically said that I wanted it with kimchi, and the menu states that you can sub out the beef for kimchi for a dollar extra.  But again, I got beef (and kimchi).  It wasn't a huge issue, as I could take out the beef easily when it was served, but take note that Sol's is a very difficult restaurant for people with dietary restrictions.I was disappointed to find that the signature Korean BBQ dish had no vegetarian option (I feel like tofu would've been easy), and there were only a couple full vegetarian dishes overall.  It was annoying to feel that limited in an Eastern restaurant, as that's far from the norm in that type of place.  Finally, this isn't a complaint (because my party liked it), but i'll note that they have a very eccentric music selection for the place.  It rarely fits the vibe that the decorations give, and it's often like a tour of weird songs.\n\nSo i'm giving Sol's a 3, because while they have a lot of things nailed down (namely the food itself), they need to work on other aspects to make it a real destination for your dining experience.",0.0,0.9886965751647948

They don't make them here and they order macarons elsewhere and would take a few days. Since I live quite far from here and don't have the patience to wait 10 days, I got honey toast and what most people have been raving about - pistachio latte. Honestly, I was not that impressed by the pistachio latte and I should have had the green tea latte instead. All Korean coffee shops I've been to have latte art but I didn't see it on mine but no biggie. I haven't heard of anyone who died due to the lack of coffee art.

I've noticed a trend that the Korean restaurants in the west valley are generally open until 11pm or even later, while the east valley restaurants close no later than 10pm. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the classy decor of the restaurant, but was a little perplexed of the \""no-grill in the table\"". Perhaps they bring out a mini-burner like Hodori? With the restaurant named \""meat\"" I would assume that is their specialty, but I will save that for another visit as I did not see any people with the burner - please keep in mind it was 9pm so I wasn't expecting the restaurant to be packed.\n\nAnyways, I ordered the mae-un-tang (spicy fish stew) and my g/f ordered the kimchi tofu soup. The side dishes came out very quickly and we were served kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled radish slices, bean sprouts, spinach, and fish cake stir fry. The radish kimchi was a little bland for my liking but the rest were pretty good.\n\nThe tofu soup was the first dish to make it out - while it had decent flavor, it didn't really compare to some of the tofu-specialty restaurants in the valley - but that's okay, we really didn't expect \""blow my mind\"" tofu soup since the restaurant's name was Gogi (meat). My spicy fish stew came out not long afterwards and was served in a traditional shallow and wide pot. Glad I ordered that - it was pretty delicious. The whitefish was nice and soft and had all of the fixings that it should have had.\n\nService was pretty good overall~ I'd definitely like to come back and try the meat dishes!",1.0,0.9965344667434692

I never received gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) for my bibimbap but I had fun dipping the rice into the soup so I ended up not missing it that much. Sadly I left my to-go box of the bibimbap at the nearby Boba House so I didn't really get to experience the dish in it's fullest form.\n\nPrices here are similar to the other Korean restaurants in the area with $10-$15 prices for most dishes.

But here it is. This place has less of the Korean-Chinese dishes and offers more traditional ones, such as Sunji Jjigae (blood cube stew) and Gopchang jjigae (tripe/intestine stew).\n\nI've been there on two weeknights, and after 6, this place gets packed. One reason is that this is a new Korean place in a city full of Asian students, another is that they are currently closed on Sundays and Mondays. This is not a large place, and parties larger than 4 are probably not going to find a table easily.\n\nKimchi Pajun/Haemool Pajun- your standard appetizer of Korean pancake. The pajun here is large and thick. The edges are crispy perfectness while the center does not hold and breaks apart. I like the Kimchi better than the Haemool (seafood). The Kimchi has kimchi-loaded and can be spicy, where as the Haemool is a little stingy on the seafood.\n\nBeef Soondubu Jjigae- soft tofu stew. There was a decent amount of beef and great large chunks of soft tofu. The broth leaves a little more to be desired, and for some reason, there was a tinge of sweetness (maybe the beef marinade)? My egg yolk also did not cook at all even though I buried it. \n\nYang Nyum Galbi - marinated beef ribs. My best part is that you cook the meat table side. You also get to choose between Egg stew, Miso/Dwenjang jjigae, and Gochujang jjigae. The egg stew was delicious and the dwenjang was OK. The ribs were the usual portion, the marinade was fine.\n\nI did not take into account the service. They are a new restaurant and obviously there are a few service kinks here and there.

Rice cake, noodles, spiced cucumbers, kimchi, beans sprouts-yummy.\n\nDownsides?:\nBulgogi was overcooked this time I went... not too much of a biggie because the short ribs were perfect. The biggie was customer service. When I asked one of the employees politely for a refill of a side, she walked right past me without acknowledging me, then returned later just taking the dish without saying anything or looking at me. She quickly came back with a refill but I found it rather rude not being acknowledged at all...as if I wasn't there. Not cool. Overall, service is inconsistent every time I head here.

We were able to choose 2 different types of Korean BBQ, a soup, and a beer or soju for just about $26. This is a great deal when it comes to Korean BBQ. The portions were ideal for 2 people. Most of the waitresses were friendly and helpful; however, we had one girl as our main waitress and she was not attentive and awfully rude. She left the bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on the stove too long and it almost burned, so I had to flip them over, cut the meat, and distribute myself. Anytime we asked her for something, she seemed angry and frustrated. We said \""thank you\"" for everything she brought over (with extreme delay I might add), and I never heard her once say \""you're welcome\"". She spoke fluent English, so I knew that wasn't the issue. Also, the food... I guess coming from the NYC area I am extremely biased; however, I was rather disappointed. The food wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near my expectations. The bulgogi was in large pieces and not juicy and the pork bulgogi was not spicy (pork bulgogi is supposed to be a spicy, flavorful dish). The side dishes were the most disappointing part. Usually, in Korean BBQ houses, you receive a bunch of side dishes to compliment your meal. Korean Garden BBQ House only gives about 4.

Taste is good, but not the effect I want.  The Chinese noodles also taste good, but they also have some shortcomings.  The jjajangmyun sauce is overly jelly-ish and there are chunks of gelatin throughout, which indicates the sauce has not been mixed very well.  I'm wondering if these are pre-packaged stuff.  There are places where the food tastes good and you finish it even if you're full.  There are others where it tastes good initially, but then wears on you as you make your way through the plate.  This was one of those.\n\nIn the end, the food that gets tired, uninteresting decor, and off-and-on service all amount to a 2.5 stars.

This place is easy on the eyes for sure.\n\nService - Very nice attentive and helpful, especially for novice BBQ eaters. If it gets busy though,  you will need to be a bit more assertive and ask for things. \n\nFood - Very nice, went for the Pork and beef. All nice and subtle tasting wtih not too much overpowering spices.  Kim Chi selection was nice, but very, westernized, meaning, that there were mostly the mild type of Kim Chi. They will refill for you based on request.  Odd that they do not serve a soup with the meal.  Fire was a bit low, so things took time to cook. Overall pretty nice.\n\nSelection - A bit more on the food. I usually order Bulgogi or Kalbi, and here they have various levels of quality of beef that I normally am not used to, so be prepared that you have choices in quality. More expensive, more quality the cut. I find, however, that proper marinade and tenderizing the meat and proper slicing make for a great meal, and I am not one to really be able to tell the great cut of meat in Korean BBQ. So, i ordered the least expensive.\n\nOther - I will for sure go back as it is easy to get to and park, as it is in Chinatown plaza, and it is fun to stroll around the little plaza and see what else is going on. Be sure, if you are on a date, to bring some mints and gum with you. The food has a lot of garlic.....\n\nCheck it out for sure.",1.0,0.9484524726867676

Instead of ordering an insane amount of food,rI ordered the Jun's Special. Consisting of bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, meat jun, rice, salad, and a fried dumpling, it was enough of a taste. It was pretty standard fare. I subbed out the white rice with brown for an extra $.50. It was dry and could have been cooked with more water. The meat jun and kalbi were my favorite. The mandoo was very crisp and the filling was predominately meat. It was not just a bunch of veggies and noodles like other places. The spices inside was spot on. I might just order a plate of this the next time I go. For $11.95, it is a diverse taste of their meat offerings. I am excited about the cold buckwheat noodles.

Now like I said, I'm from Hawaii so my experience with Korean food is limited to Yummy's and the like, which is very similar to Jun's: you choose 1-3 main dishes and 3-4 side dishes. They also take orders at your table if you want to dine in. It's also a good place to come for lunch because business is slow at that time, but it gets packed pretty quickly for dinner.\n\nThe food is GREAT; it reminds me of Yummy's. But then again, there's not much competition for oriental food in NLV, where most places are super greasy, salty, and have too much meat in the menu. For all of you veggie-lovers, Jun's serves hot tofu soup and veggie side dishes. The portions are right for the price, and I always have leftovers I can bring home and eat at a later time. The bibimbop is the bibim-BOMB. I like how they use the meat for flavoring and it's more of a healthy veggie experience than a carnivore's delight. They also sell some bomb kimchi in large jars to take home with you--you know, for your daily serving of vegetables.\n\nI'm not an expert in authenticity, so don't judge me if your Korean mother-in-law shuns you for poor taste.

I guess because we were hungry!  We definitely had waaaaay better Korean food.  (Stay tuned for my next review of it).  \n\nThe outside actually looked pretty good.  Yes, quite opposite from other restaurants we go to (Hmmm...interesting...).  We went on a Tuesday about 430pm so it wasn't crowded at all.  There was just one other person sitting there,  The lady that 'somewhat' greeted us looked like she was one of the owners. I say 'somewhat' because she was distracted with her Korean shows that was blaring from the TV situated in the middle of the restaurant,  She was in front of that TV every chance she got.\n\nWe played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.  The dishes were $14.95 each,  They only had the \""cooking\"" menu open at that time so we didn't have much of a choice.  They had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.  I really wanted to try the seafood pancake but it was $16.95 (pretty steep for me).  There lunch special prices looked okay ranging $8.00-9.00 but that ended at 230pm. \n\nWhen the dishes came out on a cast iron sizzling plates it didn't quite excite us. It came sizzling with just onions! The meat was soft but it definitely needed more flavor.  Same goes with the chicken (mind you, they used the chicken breast. I'm used to thighs.)\n\nNow, let's talk about the \""sides\"" given.  They gave about 6 side dishes.  One was a huge bowl of salad which consisted of just greens and the dressing was a simple rice vinegar/soy sauce with a bit of spice.  The other sides were the usual kimchee stuff but they didn't give much.  We actually had to ask for more.  One last thing, my husband being in the food industry business would always tip 20% regardless.  But I have to tell you that it's a big statement when he only tipped 15% at this place!!!\n\nAlright, enough about this place.
