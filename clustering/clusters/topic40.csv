I flew in from TX to celebrate my parent's 50th wedding anniversary. Lidia's was the chosen restaurant and I was very excited. We were a party of 8 and were crowded around a round table. Five of us ordered the Pasta Trio and it was the BEST fettuccine and ravioli! The pasta was fresh and the taste was out of this world! The disappointment came when we wanted more. We sat at length waiting for seconds after our initial taste trio. When we were served again, I received a spoonful of fettuccine - one to three bites. Our drinks, other than water, were only refilled once. I ended up switching from iced tea to water, not by choice but before I noticed, my tea glass was filled with water. I was also bumped throughout the meal by wait staff walking between me and a temporary wall that was put up to accommodate a large birthday party. Fortunately I can get good pasta with much better service elsewhere. I really wish I could say otherwise but I will not be back and wouldn't recommend this location unless maybe for lunch or a less busy evening. I am pretty sure if Lidia experienced the service in her own restaurant she would be appalled!",1.0,0.6035159826278687

For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich, egg salad sandwich, and cucumber dill crostini things.  The second tier had two types of scones and cantaloupe slices.  The third tier was mini cupcakes, brownies, and strawberries and cream sandwich type things.

It tasted overly fishy and the texture was terrible (the soft shell at the other sakana is where I fell in love with it in the first place). We usually leave sakana so fat and happy that the poor quality was surprising. Even the vegas roll was less than. I don't even know how you mess up cream cheese and smoked salmon.

After dinner with friends, we went over to the bar side of the restaurant.  There was a live band performing but hardly anyone was there.  They have tons of nice flat screen and few pool table.  I definitely don't recommend the food.  But if you want the whole restaurant to yourself then I guess that will be alright.",0.0,0.9966574907302856

We first tried Arcadia Farms, (awful response and not helpful), then went to the Farms at South Mountain, (Ok if want to sit at picnic tables outside with a buffet of sandwiches), and then we had the idea to try Zinc Bistro. The moment we walked in to discuss our plans they were extremely helpful and we knew we found the right place and it would be fabulous. \n\nThe staff was exceptional, we wanted for nothing during our event; the food selection they help select for the event was fantastic and accommodated everyone's taste. Since we had a large party, they even choose not to seat anyone else in the room to give us some privacy... their choice, not ours. To accommodate us, they made suggestions to make the event even more personal by setting up a cheese table and later changed it out for our cupcakes instead of taking up more room on our tables. It was the little things that made the event so special and we never felt rushed to leave so they could seat other guests. \n\nAt the end of the event everyone commented how lovely it was, what a perfect setting, and how impressed they were with Zinc Bistro's staff, and the delicious food. \n\nAs for previous comments on price, I found this very reasonable for the quality and selection. It would have cost us more at the Farms in South Mountain for a stack of sandwiches, and Arcadia Farms starting price was absurd. I highly recommend contacting Zinc Bistro for your next intimate lunch or dinner, or large event. I wouldn't hesitate to come back again and again... \n\nThank you Zinc Bistro for everything, it was perfect!! Special thanks to Cat Frankel, who helped coordinate, and Frankie our server, who everyone fell in love with.",1.0,0.998469889163971

I was so mislead by this place. I took the BF here for his *official* birthday dinner and it was a massive disappointment. The menu looks really good and the restaurant looks ok... kind of big and Houston's -ish. We were sat at one of the 'chef's tables' a table right next to the kitchen. That was kind of cool.. lots of yelling. Our server was really not good, he was extremely slow and inattentive. It took him a long time to come around, and when he did he only wanted to take drink orders. We wanted to drink water, and he didn't seem too happy with that. He walked off. Anyway, we finally ordered and I got the fried chicken and the BF got the short ribs (which he was really excited for) and we got the green chili mac and cheese due to the good reviews of it. Then we waited for a very long time. When the food came out, mine had a sauce on it that was congealed and looked really gross. The chicken itself was nothing special.... they used a really thick cut boneless breast and it was really dry. The mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like nothing.... totally flavorless. ugh. The BF's short ribs were also very meh. They were bone in (really? they couldn't take the bone out for 25$ hmmm). They also didn't render all of the fat so they had massive amounts of fat on them. Yuck. In addition, they had very little flavor... you would think something braised in Dr. Pepper would be delicious... not the case. Again, it was totally bland. Furthermore, the mac and cheese was really not good either. The first bite tasted ok, but as it went on, it tasted like kraft singles with chile peppers. yum? not so much. So we wanted to get cake, it being the BF's birthday and all.... but nothing on the dessert menu looked very good and honestly we were scared to get a dessert after the food being so lackluster. I will never go back here.",0.0,0.9993460774421692

A couple friends took me here to celebrate my birthday.

The green chili pork was flavorful and had a little spice to it but it was not overwhelming. I didn't really know what to expect with the pork wings but they took me by surprise. They were very tasty and tender. The Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce was just icing on the cake. For dinner, I had the buttermilk fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The skin was a nice golden brown with a crunch and the chicken breast itself was juicy. I believe they used red potatoes for the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mashed potatoes were good but didn't blow me away. But then again they are just mashed potatoes. I also had a huckleberry margarita to compliment my meal.",1.0,0.9993185997009276

We also broke Stan (Ashleys Grand Ffather) out of his rehabillitation facility to join us as a family meal would not be complete without him.  For dinner and we had a slew of food, all of which was great as expected, see below. \n\nThe down side was the service.  It was just terrible!  The waitress added in the 18% gratuity so knowing full well she was going to get paid well for a large party, paying attention to us was a second thought.  There were far too many other tables to attend to where the gratuity would have to be earned and not just added on automatically.  \n\nBoth Melissa and Ryan had to play \""waitress/waiter\"" and get refills for our water and ice tea, as if this was something they were reuired to do.  Where was our waitress?  Who knew?\n\nAs far as the food goes, we had 2 trays of Calimari, Cheesey Garlic Bread and a large mixed salad.  Delicious!\n\nFor the entree we chose Lobster Spaghetti, Chicken Carbonara and Baked Ziti.  Again, Delicious!  The Carbonara was the bomb!!  \n\nThe food alone is what allows this to rate a 2 star evening.  The service tore it apart and stopped any kind of positive statement to be made.  Sorry guys, you need to get your wait staff in check.  \n\nWe brought  our own dessert, a store bought birthday cake which allowed us to opt out of their offerings.  They are usually quite good though!\n\nOverall, I still love this place for the quality of the food and will certainly go back.  Lets see how they change by the next time we all return.

What was on my plate looked delicious, but it was my birthday, damnit and I wanted my lobster! As soon as I pleasantly mentioned this to our server, it became quite clear that he was a summa cum laude graduate of SnootyWaiterTradeSchool. Now I can out-snooty the best of THAT particular group, so my lobster arrived, to their credit, right away. Too bad it was overcooked. BJ's steak, on the other hand was melt in the mouth delicious. Seriously. \nSo, on to the dessert we had pre-ordered, a s'more-type-thing with warm chocolate fondant, toasted marshmallow, graham cracker and smoked vanilla ice cream. Let's go with.....the tiny-cookie plate that the chef sent over was much, much better. SnootyWaiterTradeSchoolGrad dropped the ball big time on coffee and perhaps an after dinner cocktail for the birthday girl, so we lingered a bit anyway, enjoying the view. \nAll in all, a very, very good meal, an amazing view and a five-star review becomes a 4-star review because of the waiter. What a shame.",1.0,0.991027295589447

I ordered the Peppercorn burger which arrived barely warm at best.  $16, really???? Milk shakes were OK but nothing special...all in all, $120 for 4 People, for lukewarm burgers with old garnish.   NEVER again,,,,,go to Steak and Shake,   better burgers and you will have $80 bucks in your pocket.

We tried the garlic soup - yummy, except that poached egg thing still is a little freaky to me, and the calamari with prociuttio, which was excellent, especially considering I'm not much of a calamari fan (it's a texture thing for me!).  A few of us had the beef - filet or the Delmonico, both were huge and tasty.  Our niece, who indeed had been to Mallorca before, had the halibut with spinich and pine nuts.  She said she enjoyed it, but though the tilapia entree was even better.   Coffee and dessert was also very good.  \n\nService was a little slow to start, but was very good throughout the meal.

The cucumber roll was not my favorite because most places slice the cucumber thinly, as they would in a california roll, but here, they just put a huge chunk of cucumber =( The black cod and pineapple miso salmon were both amazing... the black cod was my favorite but that's because I'm super picky with my salmon, although the pineapple miso was interesting and very flavorful. I had some of my friends' mushroom salad and that was very delicious as well. I took off a star, because they didn't have any free desserts for birthdays so instead my friends had to buy me a tiramisu from them and they still charged us...

I ordered the Filet Mignon, Onion Rings, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, Potato Gratin and corn.  ALLLLLL amazing. My favorite were the truffle mashed potatoes if I HAD to choose one.

Turns out it was for the best, because this is a hidden gem at the Venetian!  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is so cute!  The staff couldn't be nicer or more attentive.  Our water glasses were always full, and freshly baked bread was served one roll at a time (perfect for someone who lacks self-control around carbs like yours truly).  The Onion Soup Gratinee w/ the gruyere cheese  was the best french onion soup I've ever had.  Rather heavy, though, and the meal would have been perfect even if I had just stopped there.  But how could a girl  not gorge herself crazy at a place like this?  For my entree, I had the Mussel Mariniere (which is an appetizer, but works just as well as a entree).  Yummy dish, but I could have used more white wine broth.  It came with garlic fries, which was basically evil disguised in an innocent-looking cone.  Luckily, the nice server took them away before I ate too many of them.  Again, I can't emphasize how nice the staff is here.  Our waiter literally spent 15 minutes discussing all the desserts with us, and when we eventually decided on the Chocolate Souffle, it was on the house!

The disappointing part was that they didn't even put a candle in the dessert or decorate the plate or anything - so much for birthday pictures.

I was late in getting us going so I hurried inside and clicked on the Google Maps directions which sent us 20 minutes in the wrong direction.  This was fateful because when we arrived for Lunch, the salad bar was closing in a few minutes so my wife and daughters felt a bit rushed through their meals (they opted to skip on the barbeque).  Still, there was a lot of variety for lunch and they ended up filling up some extra plates and bringing them back to the table.  My son and I made a single pass through the salad, trying most of everything.  It was all very tasty.  Then the meat started coming out!  My son and I had at least six servings of everything.  Despite there being fewer selections at dinner, the meat was quite tasty (although my son commented later that it was a bit greasy for his taste.)  We ordered the Chocolate Mousse cake for dessert but they also brought a separate dessert for me, the birthday boy!  By the time we rolled out of there, I didn't need to eat until the next day!  Lunch was a great idea to save a little on money and avoid some of the crowds; just remember to get there well before 3:00 when they switch from Lunch to the Dinner buffet to avoid getting charged more.  Also, I tried the caipirinha and it was very tasty (had a similar taste to a margarita on the rocks, but better.)

The salad bar was at least not a typical Sweet Tomatoes-esque affair, with egg, potato, shrimp and chicken (and many more) salads, potato lasagna, marinated mushrooms, King crab legs, and crab rangoons. Then the meats started coming fast and furious. The turkey was clearly processed, the chicken drumstick was over-seasoned and dry, the filet mignon was over-cooked and tasted like organ meat, the pork loin was quite dry, and the sausage was tough and gristle-y. My favorite was the sirloin by far. Hubby enjoyed it all more than I did, even though I am usually the bigger carnivore. The service was good, except they were constantly trying to up-sell with drinks ($7 a piece) and dessert which were not included in the $29.95 basic meal. I got a hat on my head and a ball of fudge with a candle in it for my birthday dessert. The grand total, with an appropriate tip, was $95- not worth the indigestion for the rest of the night.

Reservations were for Friday night 8:45pm. Note: Your required to confirm the day of the reservation before Noon.  Checked in with the matre' D was pleased to be escorted directly to our table.  It was already crowded with people at the lounge having drink while waiting for their own table?? There was 3 of us for dinner-2 guys and myself.  We were lead toward the back and seated at a table close to the sushi bar. Before you read any further this review is truly dedicated the service and to our waiter vs. the food.  In celebration of my birthday we ordered a bottle of the yellow label and Voss Sparkling water. After reviewing the menu, I asked the waiter what recommendations he had, and even though we ended up not getting anything that was mentioned, I thought it was great that he had extensive knowledge about the food.  We ordered:  Satay of chilean sea Bass with grilled asparas, Wasabe crusted filet mignon with tempura onion rings, Duck friend rice,Noodles and Short-ribs.  The food honestly was mediocre for the price that you are paying.  There are so much more comparable quality food here in SF  that don't cost and arm and a leg.  Needless to say I wasn't too disappointed as my expectations weren't that high, and I was paying to be part of the scene.  Now Kudos for the service, the waiter was extremely courteous, came at the right times to offer service,and always made sure that glasses were always filled.  I'm a lightweight and only drank a glass of champagne, I thought it was wonderful  that he was so observant and only filled up my companions glasses and only towards the end of dinner did he offer me more.  and lastly because there was a male to female Ratio at the clubs, even with a $300 dollar dinner I still wouldn't have been able to get in, he worked the magic and got all 3 of us line passes for the club because it was my birthday.  Above and Beyond.  \nIn summary: Tao Restaurant is a place to see and be seen, just don't have too hight expectations about the food.  Especially for those of you who live here in SF.",1.0,0.968665361404419

I can't believe this because so many reviews said it was great.  Some people that came to the lunch who had eaten here before said it was a little off, but I don't see how this could possibly be good.

They were bland... I ate a little of it but mostly skipped that too.\n\nSo for $12 I ate most of the chicken and avoided everything else.\n\nAlso, they wouldn't give us the birthday $10 off thing because we were lunching the day before my birthday.

I had signed up for Brio's email club several months ago and got an email wishing me a happy birthday and offering me a free surf & turf dinner ($30 value!).  Naturally, I couldn't pass that up.  Plus, we had been to Brio before and had an exceptional time.  This time, though, we brought my partner's kids.  I was very impressed with the kids' menu.  It was quite extensive.  There were regular kids' portion size items and then there were bigger portion options for older kids.  Some were full dinners -- grilled chicken or a pork chop with mashed potatoes and broccoli!  Then there's the create your own pizza where kids can choose three items on top of their humongous-sized pizza (it's literally enough for two meals).  \n\nAnyway, enough with the kids' stuff.  I don't order steak out very often, but I have to say that the filet served with my surf & turf dinner was one of THE most amazing pieces of steak I've ever had.  It was so thick, tender, and perfectly cooked and seared.  I savored each and every bite, and there were a lot of them.  The crab & shrimp cake that I was looking forward to was delicious, too, but the filet really overshadowed it, both in size and taste.  Rounding out the meal were roasted veggies and potatoes.  It was just the perfect amount of food so I wouldn't be overstuffed for the birthday cake that was waiting for me at home. :)\n\nMy partner ordered the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto, which was prepared with pancetta, roasted chicken and sweet potatoes, grilled asparagus, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and pine nuts.  Our server described it as \""Thanksgiving in a bowl,\"" but it was SO much more than that.  I tried a taste of it and it was incredible.  It had so much flavor to it, including hints of wine.  My partner gobbled it right up (pun intended).  I seriously think he could have eaten another bowlful.  \n\nBrio may look intimidating, but they're not as formal or pricey as one might expect.

I indulged in their sashimi appetizer, which was fresh and quite tasty; definitely a great start.  Instead of the steak (I know, I know lol) I opted for a Kobe burger cooked medium rare, and I couldn't be happier (wish I could've finished it but at least I got to take the rest home ;P).

I decided to forgo my non-dairy diet for this meal, to enjoy the true experience.   We both ordered the menu prestige and I had the special wine pairing. The waiter explained  each dish on arrival, as well as the wine pairing.   The bread cart server paired the bread with each dish for us so that it would complement each other.

Nice, chunky pieces of bacon on the top of the little muffin. \n\nMy favorite of the 10 course meal, though all were delicious, would be the Foie-Gras with radish leaves and the Artichoke and Black Truffle soup.

I had heard about it and thought it sounded good. When I arrived I was surprised that it was in a strip mall. The concept is very cute. The interior is ok but small. When we sat at our booth I thought it would be nice but that's when things fell apart. My daughter ordered a steak. $23.95! It was over cooked and breaded to much. She sent it back and told them about it. They still had the nerve to charge her $20.00 for a tiny salad and a little pasta. The rest of our party ordered their food and said it was just ok but the prices are way to high. The piano player was way in a corner and he kept singing to the wall instead of the crowd. There were two birthdays at our table and not one did one thing. The waitress was polite but not friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

I thought it inappropriate for them to seat us in the bar when you are celebrating a special occasion. We moved into the dining area and I was ready for an amazing meal. We started with the goat cheese won tons and ahi tuna appetizer. They were both slightly above average but both needed more sauce. We also tried 2 specialty cocktails and neither were very good, and tasted watery. \n\nNow for the entree, I ordered the Alaskan halibut (btw- what I was served looked nothing like the other reviewer's pic of halibut) thinking it would be absolutely divine, my husband had scallops. What a disappointment!!! My halibut was not fresh caught, tasted like it had just come out of the freezer, AND was overcooked to the point of being completely dry. I had to eat the weird sauce that came with it just to be able to eat the dry chunk of fish. What a waste for the most expensive item on the menu. The scallops were not cooked properly either and were mushy, instead of having a nice crisp on the ends. Both meals came with mashed potatoes that were clearly yesterday's leftovers as they were cold in the center and tasted like a blend of instant and real mashed potatoes. They didn't have flavor and came with an unappetizing gravy that tasted canned. The entire meal was a disappointment but I scarfed down the food just so I could get out of there. Their only saving grace and reason I gave them more than 1 star was that they brought out a birthday dessert for me. \n\nThis is the 2nd year in a row that I had a crappy birthday dinner from trying a new place based on Yelp reviews.

The host wished us a happy anniversary when he looked up our reservation.  We were seated right on time.   Waiter was attentive and helpful.  Ordered a bottle of champagne and started with crab-cake appetizer and Caesar salad.  The crab-cake was very good except for one piece of lump crab that was slightly fishy.  Caesar salad was excellent.  However before we finished half of the appetizers they delivered our main courses.  As soon as our waiter noticed (he did not deliver the main courses) he came over.  We mentioned that never in all of our dinning experiences in up scale restaurants had we had our main courses delivered while we were still eating our appetizers.  By the way, we are reasonably fast eaters and were not dawdling other than to enjoy the champagne with the appetizers.  Our waiter apologized and took the main courses away.\n\nOnce we finished the appetizers he brought our main courses- the large size stone crabs and Joe's famous scallops.  The stone crab claws were excellent, the scallops uninspired.\n\nWe finished with one of their key lime pies and one of their coconut pies.  Both excellent.  Though we were surprised that no mention was made of our anniversary by the waiter nor a token candled cupcake as was delivered to a few nearby tables in celebration of birthdays.\n\nSo all in all an OK experience marred by the rush delivery of our main course.  Certainly not what we expect when spending several hundred dollars on a dinner.",0.0,0.983111560344696

Sunshine roll had tuna with a mango sauce that was a refreshing fruit sauce to the palate since most of our rolls were sweet, salty, and or creamy/rich.

Bf ordered Rib Eye (Bistecca Alla Fiorentina) with gorgonzola gratin and olive oil. I thought mine was a bit too salty, and a bit messy considering the veal sits on top of the mashed potato. I really didn't care for it.\n\nBf's rib eye, on the other hand, was delicious. It was cooked to perfection, exactly medium rare. The sauce wasn't overwhelming.

There's a bar set up right in the middle, with a huge flat screen TV over it, which kind of takes away from it being a classy atmosphere, but they didn't have the volume turned up and no one was sitting at the bar screaming at it. \n\nAs far as the food, it was...OK...I took a poll of the table and everyone was in agreement that their food wasn't bad. Just wasn't great. And for the price it might have had better presentation and maybe a salad to start. But the bread was good, and those of my party that will eat spicy food enjoyed the pepper's in oil. I had the chicken parmigiana which comes with a little spaghetti on the side, and wasn't impressed by the sauce. I ordered the canolli for desert that comes with one canolli, and a huge plate, sprinkled with powdered sugar and one strawberry....it was disappointing. The cream filling was gritty and the shell seemed a little stale. \n\nAs far as service goes, it was hard not to laugh at them. They were trying hard to be hospitable but would fill the water glasses right on the table with their arm in the face of one person or another. I ordered wine and they didn't offer to let me taste it first, just poured it into my glass and walked away, luckily for me it was good tasting! My friend joined us a little late and then for the rest of the evening was forgotten time and time again. We had to keep pointing her out to the server by asking if she wanted anything to eat, drink or for dessert. \n\nOverall, I'm a little sad that I wasn't blown away by the experience. Probably not going to rush back or recommend to someone else that asks. Maybe it was just the night, the importance of it to me, and then the lackluster reception that seemed to occur, but I'm sorry to say it was just OK.",0.0,0.9908168315887452

I went with a couple friends to celebrate my birthday and it was a very nice evening but there were a few minor things that are kind of eating at me.  The plates came out to our table a little less clean then they could of been.  I don't mean unwashed clean but food from making the dishes on the sides and on the bottoms of the plates so when you handled them your hands got greasy and dirty.  The next thing was that we didn't have one waitress but everyone that worked there.  Our main waitress took our order etc but then the hostess and some other girl would keep coming around too and ask if we needed more water etc literally like 3min after our main waitress had checked on us.  Seems like they need better delegation of jobs so they aren't all doing the same thing.  \n\nThe drinks were strong and the dessert was stronger.  A good drink doesn't mean overpowering alcohol.  And the dessert was so overpowered by the rum that it was almost uneatable.  The cake itself had a good flavor but there was just too much rum.  Our main meals were very good though.  I had the pork which was incredibly tender and the rice side was really tasty.  I don't know what kind of dressing was on the salad but it was really good.  If you don't like overly strong drinks you'd better tell them that ahead of time.  \n\nOverall, as I said, it was a really nice evening.

I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.\n\nBut I have to calls em like I sees em.\n\nLet's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.

This would be a great place for HH.\n\nI came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.\n\nTheir yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.\n\nWhen we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.\n\nFor dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.\n\nAnd to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.\n\nOnce again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts.",1.0,0.9982810020446776

Party of 10.\n\nMy wife made reservations for our friend's birthday party about 5 days in advance.  We were seated to at two tables pushed together, with four people on each side and one on the ends.  They have a very small dining room, so I know they wanted to get as many people in as possible, but this was a bit much.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive and gave great suggestions to their limited menu.  She explained that everything is fresh and local, so that is why there is only about 5 or 6 selections for main courses.  We all ordered appetizers for the table and our main courses.  She asked us (in a statement kind of way) \""soup or salad\"", so everyone assumed it was included in our entrees.  Not so much.  Being that the entrees are all over $25 and up to $42, I was a little put off that she didn't ask us if we wanted soup or salad, suggesting it was extra.  My bad for assuming and not delving further, but everyone at the table (but one) was a bit ticked that they got charged another $10 for salad, when they wouldn't have ordered it.  Basically, they got an extra $90 out of the party for salads nine people didn't really want.\n\nMy dinner was fantastic.  I ordered the double boned pork chop.  It could have fed a small army, it was that big, but it was also really delicious.  My wife ordered the scallops, and they were overdone and had a lot of sand in several of them, which ruined it for her.\n\nOverall the experience was good, but for the money ($200 with tip for 2 people), I would have liked my wife's food and the seating to be better.  Also, they charged me for 2 more beers than I actually ordered ($9 a piece), so I had to have her fix that.",0.0,0.9097552299499512

I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.\n\nWe ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.\n\nThe bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.\n\nAll in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here.",0.0,0.9982858300209044

The only reason why I give this a 4 star is due to the seating; they tried to sit us in a nice area away from the crowd, but it was too close to the door where people were walking in and out constantly throughout our meal~ kudos for trying though.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent restaurant and I would highly recommend it as the food is as good as the service~ I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! - Cheers",1.0,0.9987624883651732

So, factor that in with the noise factor, and you can barely recognize what you are being offered/served. We arrived during 'Happy hour'....that is only offered in the bar. Can't really enjoy that with a child, can we? But our waitress, who didn't offer her name, nor had a name tag told us that she \""wouldn't mind if we went to the bar to get a drink.\""\n\nOh, how gracious of you.\n\nI saw that they had a coconut mandarin mojito, that didn't sound very appetizing to me, so I asked if there was a way to do a pineapple one. The waitress said that would be no problem. The $12 mojito should be left to the Cuban Cuisine  at Havana Grill......Sorry, Brazil.\n\nWords can't describe the taste... Barely any pineapple, I felt like it was over poured, or mixed wrong....I guess that's what I get for asking for a custom drink.\n\nThe salad bar was probably the highlight. The little circles hardly mean anything to the servers. After we had decided that some of the meat was either salty, or too tough, we had flipped all three of the circles provided to red. However, we were constantly interrupted by servers. At least 6 times.\n\nThe best meat that we had was the bacon wrapped chicken. It was moist, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned..and the lamb chop...even though it was gamey-er than any other lamb that I have ever had...Everything else was just kind of a miss. My guy stopped eating a lot earlier than I did, he said that he was feeling funny....\n\nWell, that funny feeling had hit BOTH of us by the time we got home. We felt severely nauseated....I have never felt this way so quickly after eating food.\n\nNeedless to say, $120 (before tip, with 1 drink), is way too much for us to pay to get sick.",0.0,0.98616760969162

For the entree, I chose the grilled trout served with herbed aioli and quinoa salad.

A Fantastic combination!\n\nFor the entree I ordered the special; pan seared halibut served with a chilled wild rice salad. It was soooo good, The wild rice salad really stood out with the combo of cranberries, walnuts and rasins. It was a sweet-n-savory treat. For dessert they allowed us to bring our own cheesecakecreme icing  cake from yours truly-Harris Teeter, and served it to us after we sang my m-o-l happy birthday. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give them five stars is b/c althouh I made a reservation for my m-o-l's b-day celebration we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated.

This really sucks because there are so many other noisy and loud games around it and, well, its a rhythm game.  You kinda really need to hear the music to play.  But despite the fact we spend about 2 or so hours just lurking around playing pump and getting waters and sodas so we don't pass out, save for one or two of them most of the staff are pretty cool. Some of them will gladly turn up the machine a bit if we ask.\n\nFrom what I know of it pool and bowling is pretty expensive so we stay away from that normally.  But we totally hit up some pool on their half-price Wednesdays!!\n\nEven if you don't go here that much I would suggest joining the mailing list to get coupons for the cards - that way you can get more bang for your buck when you can.",0.0,0.9747528433799744

The food is unique and the ingredients seem to be very high quality (the volcano beef cooked on a rock was very well marbled and delicious).

For me that's always a great sign!  We were seated in a booth by the outside patio and here's the first major downside...there were flies everywhere.

I won't bore you with the details just know I was not impressed at all. \n\nBut on to the food, I ordered the Lil' pig (pork BBQ sandwich) and macaroni and cheese. The BBQ was just okay. It just wasn't anything special. I did enjoy trying all the different sauces on the table. The slaw was meh. But I'm not really a slaw lover. The real downer was the mac and cheese...so bland and tasteless.

Service was top notch, everything came out timely with great food descriptions (which are like lullaby's for me, soo soothing.)  \n\nWhile speaking to our server, (I WILL find out her name, because she deserves to be in this review) I mentioned that it was my birthday, and also that I was a culinary student. Later in the night I asked who the chef was that evening, she told me that Shawn McClain was in, and he then came out and spoke with us.  It was such an honor to meet such a wonderful and successful chef!\n\nWe ended our meal with the canneles de bordeaux.\n\nIt was an incredible night filled with amazing food, quality service, and happiness.\n\nWe will be returning again in June, and I can't wait!",1.0,0.9996973276138306

For a restaurant as popular at Sage,  it was amazing! \n\nWe started off with a selection of bread. I tried both the sourdough and the bacon bread. You'd think that bacon bread is great, but it was a bit salty and not as good as I would've expected. It was still very interesting. The bread also came with some herb butter and salt, which was especially nice with the sourdough. Following the bread, we received a starter (an amuse-bouche ,which was definitely a fancy touch). I can't quite recall what was in it, but it was also very interesting in its combination of tastes.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the braised wagyu short rib, which was delicious. It was sweet and well-braised, and came with some veggies on top. I believe its was pieces of sliced potatoes and/or radish. While it didn't look very big, it was deceivingly filling. I'd definitely recommend this one.\n\nI also tried some of my friends' dishes. The duck breast was very tasty. Also, I had a bit of the gnocchi, which was very rich. I can imagine that my friends who had ordered  that one were very full. \n\nOne thing that I was disappointed with was that they charge you for sparkling water! Not OK! With a restaurant as nice as this, the \""flat or sparkling water?\"" question should yield complementary waters with either choice. Anyway, over that!\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the restaurant and the food. The ambiance is pretty nice although most of the clientele seems to be of the older crowd. We were probably the youngest ones in the restaurant. Would like to come back!",1.0,0.998396098613739

I am not a fan of people talking about the high end places they visit when writing a review, but I will break my own rule here. We go to a lot of nice places living in San Francisco and traveling quite a bit. We like to either ask our server to choose our dinner at small plate restaurants or order a tasting menu. \n\nSage offered up an okay menu with okay service. The reason for 2 stars was the Wagyu beef course. It was cooked well done and tasted like beef jerky. inedible and I mentioned it to the server who took my plate. I had 1 bite and my friend ate 2 bites. For this price, I would expect some sort of reaction to both of us sending our beef back and mentioning it to the waiter. Nothing was mentioned again. We didn't want any type of compensation but expected some sort of acknowledgement of the issue. Maybe re making the dish. Most chef's notice when 2 plates come back untouched. Again it was the beef course which is usually the highlight of a tasting menu. \n\nAnother lowlight was the desert under the dome, it was just for show and made no sense. the raspberry mousse in a chocolate egg was way out of proportion. The next it was served on was tasty.\n\nVery disappointed by the dinner and the experience.  It felt like it was done on autopilot.",0.0,0.9958022236824036

It's a decent size, but isn't the best location for a surprise because of the openness of it. Nonetheless, we were able to \""hide\"" well enough for the birthday girl to only notice us as she got really close. The wait staff were nice, helpful and very attentive. If ever we asked for something, they were right back with whatever it was we had asked for. As with all BYOW I've been to, the menu is overpriced to counter the lack of alcohol profits, which is unfortunate for someone who is unable to drink at the moment (damn you antibiotics!!). I ordered from the Table d'Hote, starting with a House Salad (mixed greens with a balsamic dressing) and the Gnocchi. The House Salad was deeeelish. I know, it's just a house salad, but it was really good! Unfortunately, the Gnocchi didn't garner the same reaction. It was good, but felt pretty heavy with all the oil, so I took half home to eat the next day for lunch (when I had the leftovers the following day, forget it; the globs of oil made it almost impossible to eat!). The best part was probably the dessert; I had planned on ordering a cannolli because they are soooo good, but we were told that a birthday cake had been purchased and would be distributed to all guests. I must say I was a bit disappointed, until I found out it was red velvet, with buttercream layers. NUFF SAID!! I am a huge red velvet lover, and that cake was so decadent, I almost licked my plate clean. But I didn't, because I didn't want to be THAT girl. \n\nI've never had a bad experience at any Portovino locations, although I see others have.

I also had their vodka and lemonade as well.\nThe wings($34.95) were pretty solid. Tasted really good and were spicy enough for me to handle.

Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had.\n \nMy date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.\n\nWe started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload. \n\nThe menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer. \n\nAs for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...\n\nThis was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.\n\nI have a true soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB! \nI don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.\n\nOne more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together.

I realize that we had a large table, but we made reservations. I felt like the restaurant was pretty unprepared. It took almost an hour to receive our food - it was good, but not worth the wait. \n\nMy boyfriend and I split the prosciutto and fig panini - it was a little dry for my liking. We also ordered a bruschetta plank - for $12 you get 6 huge pieces of bruschetta, a really good amount of food for the money! My friend Nikki and I split a bottle of wine - Riesling is our favorite. \n\nWhen the birthday cake arrived, 5th and Wine brought out a bundle of balloons - we couldn't figure out if someone at the restaurant had prepared these for Amy, or if some other customer had left them at the restaurant, but Amy was the recipient. \n\nWhen we sat down for dinner we requested everyone have split checks. At the end of the dinner (after having to hunt down our waitress who seemed to get lost in the kitchen) we asked for our individual checks and she said she could \""only bring them if we didn't change seats.\"" What a bizarre thing to say to your customers! \n\nOverall I say the price of the food is good for the portions you receive.

Yeah RIGHT. I went there this weekend for a birthday dinner with two other girls (quite a small group, especially for Vegas). Made a reservation for 9:30. Waited for forty-five minutes to be seated. Got seated at a weird boothy table that was way too big for three people and was positioned directly under what can only be described as an arctic chill blasting from a vent above us. Ordered the salmon tartare, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy crab roll. I'm not a sushi chef, but I can't imagine it takes that long to make that - yet it took almost a hour. The portions were TINY and way overpriced. The real cherry on top was our waitress, who was pretty much MIA the whole night, but decided to pop in after we ate and tell me that my friends had ordered a dessert for me ahead of time for my birthday. Thanks galpal! Maybe they have a different definition for surprise over at Blue Ribbon. The only redeeming thing was the dessert itself - the most rich, perfectly decadent without over doing it, melt in your mouth chocolate cake. Noms. \nMoral of the story: if you want to pay ridiculous amounts of money to eat tiny pieces of raw fish and get poor service, Blue Ribbon is for you!

I'd probably get it again, maybe.  The steak was really tender, but the flavor wasn't anything amazing.  The steak came on top of potato-hash which came on top of mushrooms and an oil-based sauce.  I really would have preferred not to have fried potatoes resting on top of an oil-based sauce.  I barely touched the potoatoes because the oil and fried potatoes weren't really working well for me.

Even though we were about 10 minutes late, they got us out on time.  The host and our server were both aware of the birthday and the time constraint (without any prompting.)\n\nOur server Bill was impeccable.  The perfect balance of charming, personable, professional and communicative.  He checked in at all the right times, was prompt and confident with recommendations and questions, and made sure the timing of every aspect of our meal (drinks, appetizer and entrees) were spaced appropriately and yet delivered promptly to keep us on schedule.\n\nThe restaurant decor was charming and cozy (it's a small place, so I'd strongly recommend reservations.)  It's located in a rather rundown casino, but the restaurant itself would be worthy of a spot in any high-end casino.   Your money spent here is clearly going into the quality of the food and the service rather than their rent.  It's actually quite easy to get to by Vegas standards.  You can park in a surface lot immediately adjacent to the hotel, walk into the hotel, follow signs to the left side of the lobby, and voila, you're there!

Creamy rather than gooey, fresh little bits of lobster throughout....YUM!\n\nFor our mains, we had the duck (out of this world, I was making little noises of delight) and the short rib (he was awfully quiet, which always means he's really loving it.)\n\nMy cocktail was interesting, and his wine was fabulous.\n\nWe loved every bit of the Barrymore.

It was served in a garlicky vodka sauce which tasted decent and it also came with 3 pieces of cheesy garlic toast. We split a Caesar salad which was excellent. The whole anchovies in it was the perfect touch. When I got my steak I knew it was a little over cooked. I could tell it was on the medium-medium well side even though I ordered it medium rare.

I had 4 helpings of their miso marinated steamed seabass, which was delicious!\n\nOf course, since the buffet is the largest buffet in all of Las Vegas, there were enough other things to eat that were delicious that we all ended up stuffed.

We heard wonderful reviews about the restaurant and it was the worse experience of my life.  We had reservations at 7 pm on the patio but because its Arizona and still pretty warm we decided to get a table in doors.   It took the waitress 30 plus minutes just to take our drink orders.   Once we got inside the waitress took off (didn't see her for another 15 minutes).  When she came back she was ready to leave again assuming that we were not ready to order we had to quickly interrupt her to let her know we were.  I order the baseball steak medium and Mac n cheese.  My sister order the marinated steak medium with mac n cheese.   It took 2 hours for our food to come out.  The waitress was great at excuses the reason it took so long is the cooks were making sure the steaks were well done (others in our party, ordered well done).  Also I noticed the lighting is very dark in there (I think it's so you can't really look at your food).  When the steaks finally came out, they were well done to burnt.  I asked for a bite of my sisters steak and all I could taste was the burnt marinade.  The mac n cheese was horrible over cooked noodles with no cheese and very dry (wasn't creamy at all).  The baked potato the others in the party got were undercooked.  Now how do you under cook a potato and over cook a steak?  It is a steakhouse right?!?  The waitress asked how the food was and I told her, terrible.  The manager came over and offer some desserts (which was nice).  The birthday girl ordered lemon br\u00fbl\u00e9e, we ordered the key lime pie and we ordered the Oreo dessert.  5 minutes later the waitress comes back and says there isn't anymore lemon cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  So the birthday girl orders the Oreo dessert as well.  The waitress comes back puts a Oreo dessert in front of someone in our party with a candle and tries to light the candle (it wasn't the birthday girl mind you).  We had to stop her telling it was the wrong person, after that incident the waitress didn't come back at all.

I had the fried calamari, pardon peppers, the dates wrapped in bacon and the paella which was very delicious and loaded with seafood. The peppers were medium to mild but you may end up with a very spicy one, but as Forrest Gumpzalez once said \""life is a plate of peppers, you never know which one is going to burn you\"". I asked the waiter if they could fry the calamari in tempura mix instead of their regular mix and they did which means that everything is made to order and not frozen ready like other places do.\n I also ordered the sangria and a mojito and they both were perfectly done, a harmonious mixture of fruits and wine made this sangria one of the best I tasted. \n  Service was great..at the beginning and then it slowly became nonexistent, but to be fair I think we might have overstayed our welcome. I blame it on the sangria. \nTip was included on the bill as any establishment would do for parties of 8 or more but we added some more to cover lingering fees.\nGreat times and great food will surely keep me coming for more and if you keep on making good drinks as good as your dates wrapped in bacon, you'll definitely have me wrapped around your sangria for sure.",1.0,0.9974217414855956

I had only been to N&B's for a Yelp event, so I was excited to actually have a dinner. We grabbed a table outside, which is quite pleasant even though you're basically in the parking lot. The entire night our server was on point. She was friendly, but not too much, quick and helpful when it came to offering up dinner suggestions. The manager even came over to check on our meal. We made reservations and ate early, around 6:30. I would recommend this, considering this place tends to get busy. I really like the decor of N&B's- cozy with a twist. \nNow on to the food... \nWe all ordered the red wine blend that was on special, perfect way to start off the night, follow by their complementary popcorn... spicy and a little odd, but not bad, just not expected. We ordered the poblano cheese dip. Wow, It's heavy like you would expect and served with homemade chips, the only problem, you may completely ruin your appetite with this appetizer. \n\nOn to the main dishes- Between the meatloaf, tacos and my pork chops, everything was great. Heavy southern dishes all with a modern add on spicy grits and salmon tacos. The only downside, the majority of the menu was very heavy. I didn't think they had a lot of lighter options to choose from. The menu is a little on the pricier side- ranging from 18-30 dollars for an entr\u00e9e, but I do think the pricing is justified. \n\nThe night was sealed with a sweet treat of turtle Cheesecake, on the house....

Instead we received solid recommendations on all parts of the food menu, all which turned out quite well.\n\nThe crab cakes are as advertised - fantastic, and I'm not a crab cakes fan.

Two of us split a wedge salad, the other two split a Caesar salad - which was prepared expertly at tableside. \n\nSteaks were fantastic. Fan. Tastic.

It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \n\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \""good old days\"" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\n\nRustler's Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \n\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\n\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\n\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\n\nFor the meal, I had the \""catch of the day\"" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \n\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \n\nProbably not.

I would rather eat at an ok restaurant (food wise) with great service than the opposite.

Perhaps it was because we were in Vegas,  and Bouchon was in the Venetian with a heavy tourist population, but nonetheless, the vibe didn't scream out \""5 stars\"".\n\nThe service was slow, probably due to the overly packed restaurant, and the vibe really reminded me of an energetic Cheesecake Factory.\n\nThe food itself was good.

So we showed up (kind of on the late side for brunch) and put our name on the list. Though the host said it would take us 50 minutes to be seated, we were seated in more like 10-15. (Yes, he said 50. Not 15. I checked.) Nice surprise!\n\nAfter inspecting the menu, we had to go with some of the more famous brunch dishes on the menu. My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles, and I went with the mussels and frites. We also couldn't resist the salmon tartare appetizer that was on special that day.\n\nFirst off was the salmon and a couple of mimosas. Both were extremely tasty. The salmon was super fresh, and served with bits of egg, red onion, capers, along with a bit of toasted bread. My only complaints was that we didn't get quite enough toast to eat everything and the small pieces of eggs and such were kind of difficult to get on the bread. The taste was fantastic, though.\n\nThen came the main courses, and they were as good as everyone says. The mussels were a nice variation on the usual preparation, as the mustard in the sauce gave it the kick that it needed. The fries were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, definitely in the top five of best fries I've ever had. And the chicken and waffles? I got to try a bit, and it was amazing. The waffle was nice and fluffy, with bits of bacon and chives in there. And they serve it with roasted chicken that was perfectly cooked. Perhaps most surprising were the portion sizes, which were enormous. I wasn't particularly hungry for the rest of the day.\n\nThe service was top notch and the atmosphere was nice and laid back.

No. Not even a \""happy birthday!\"" from the server!\n\nOne kid in our party ordered scrambled eggs but they came with cheese -- not mentioned on the menu -- and the kid can't have cheese, so he had to re-order his brunch. \n\nService was blah, food was pretty blah, and the 20% added because we were a party of eight (really we were two parties, one of three and one of five) was icing on the cake, so to speak. \n\nIn this competitive environment, I'm surprised this place has been around as long as it has. Prices were relatively high, as well, and there aren't many options such as turkey sausage or waffles, both of which I was hoping for. Overall, a big \""so-so\"" experience.",0.0,0.9990967512130736

We were seated just shortly after our check-in when our whole party arrived, which was great, but after that our time at the table seemed to be an unsuccessful long one. We weren't seated with menus and waited quite a while for some info as to what was going on. When our server, Justin notified us that the Chef usually likes to do a \""tasting menu\"" for larger parties bringing us items geared towards our tastes we thought that sounded pretty good. He left us to talk it over, and when he came back I asked him if he was sure it was going to be enough food and he said yes we would all leave full so eight out of the eleven in my party decided to try it. With that being said, it wasn't even close to enough food. Edamame, fried green beans and roasted peppers along with what totaled up to be a little more than one sushi roll for each of us and a few skewers of chicken and what looked like a single portion of steak, we all left hungry.\n\nI will say the food was delicious, there just was not enough of it and each of my guests felt guilty not wanting to eat more than others. Several of my party asked me if there was more food coming, but after we received the meat portion that was it. Justin was nice enough to bring a round of shots over for the party, but this was only after two people in my party, who had skipped on the preset menu asked about how much longer their food was going to be after they had ordered it almost thirty minutes earlier! The food was finally brought out with some apologies and my friends ate while we all sat and waited for them to be done. They had insisted it just be cancelled because they felt so bad for us having to wait for them, but I told them to go ahead and eat their dinner. To my surprise, the order that had taken almost thirty additional minutes to come out was still on their bill. \n\nI wish our experience would have been better and we would have left full and happy from an enjoyable birthday dinner, but instead I left feeling embarrassed that my friends and my experience wasn't a better one. \n\nI will also say I tried to reach out to the restaurant directly about my concerns and was told someone would contact me on November 21st... needless to say I never heard anything.",0.0,0.9980021119117736

I have lived 8 miles from here for years!! And never knew about this place. Today is my birthday and I was craving a Mexican Seafood restaurant. So I did a search on Yelp to help me decide where to go. That's how I found Mariscos Sinaloa. My boyfriend and I walked in. We were greeted by the staff. It was seat yourself so I chose a corner booth. A friendly waitress (wish I knew her name, she wore glasses and had a big smile all the time) immediately brought over chips & salsa and took our drink order. When she delivered our drinks I told her it was our first time there. She had a big smile on her face and welcomed us (again). Since a lot of the menu was in Spanish she helped us understand and explained some of the selections on the menu. She did it with enthusiasm which made us feel appreciated as guests. I love queso dip but did not see it on the menu. So I just took a stab at it and asked her if they had queso dip. She said they did but it was not on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised. The queso dip was very good and creamy. My boyfriend ordered the Camerones Baconera. He really enjoyed it. I sampled it and wouldn't mind ordering it for myself next time we come. Big plump shrimp swimming in a creamy, spicy, chipotle type sauce.  I ordered the Molcajetes. OMG!! Entr\u00e9e big enough for 2. It had grilled octopus, carne asada, bacon wrapped shrimp, grilled green onions, cheese stuffed pepper, and grilled chicken in a spicy sauce sizzling in a hot clay-type pot. I was not disappointed!! I was not able to finish and had to ask for a to-go container. I saw a smile on boyfriend's face when I asked for the to go box. He was probably thinking that he is getting the leftovers....NOPE!!

I decided to arrange to have my best friend's birthday dinner here while I visited her from out of town.

I decided on Centurion because of their menu and the photos.\n\nI also had been in contact with one of the people who worked there to arrange this dinner--he was very helpful and friendly\n\nWe ate outside on the patio since our party was 7 people (the inside is pretty small). They had a fire pit on since it was cold.\n\nThere were a couple of options for dinner service. Since the restaurant is pretty small, I believe they only had a limited number of ovens and said that if we decided to individually get stuff then it'd just come out in batches, and not all at once. Or, if we wanted they would just start rolling things out based on what they could cook the quickest. We picked the first option.  I got the chorizo risotto which tasted so yummy and creamy! I also had the duck pizza, which was surprisingly very good. A good size (about 12-14inches in diameter). My friends got the tilapia, they said it was bland.\n\nWe brought over a birthday cake and there was a cake cutting fee for about $5 a slice--which was pretty expensive (7 people x $5 = $35 to slice a $50 cake). I would forgo bringing a cake over and just wait til you get home or something to cut a cake for 7 people. One thing that disappointed me was when he told me there was a cake cutting fee, it was \""around $3-5 a slice\"" .. Obviously, he kept the ambiguity of the price and decided to charge me the more expensive. If you decide to choose the cake cutting fee, ask for the actual price and not the approximate.\n\nThey split the check for us, took a little bit longer than expected. An automatic gratuity of %18 was added to the bill.\n\nI'd try it out again, maybe the experience would be different with a smaller party of 2 or 3! :)",0.0,0.9927916526794434

I try and be stingy with 5 stars, but Southern Rail earned all five last night. I was there for the grand opening and they were not serving their full menu yet, so I was excited to return when a friend decided to have her birthday dinner there. We arrived a little early for our reservation, but no problem we were seated within a couple of minutes. Our waiter was right there to bring us water and get us started on drinks. \n\nThe fried green tomatoes and the pull apart rolls with apple butter were devine. I was stuck between ordering the duck or the pork, then our waiter described them both and I ended up with the duck on dirty rice risotto and collard greens. Amazing, the duck basically melted in my mouth. Everything was so full of flavor, and just the right amount so you are not too full, but satisfied. Also had the beignets for dessert, those were also perfect. Chef Beckett happened to be in the kitchen last night, so he came out and said Happy Birthday to the guest of honor, which was so nice. She has always loved his restaurants and his cooking, so she fan girled just a little bit. \n\nIt was a perfect dinner. The wait-staff was attentive, the food was excellent, and although it is a very noisy place, I want to go back soon! (It's pricey, so unfortunately it can't be a weekly (or daily) event as much as I would like it to be.)",1.0,0.9907022714614868
