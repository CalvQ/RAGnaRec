I took my mom to the one in Tempe, where I used to go all the time, I guess I forgot how crowded and loud it gets in there, but she liked it.

Don't get me wrong, I like these cute little guys.  But when I'm eating my lunch and there are five of them at my feet fighting over a pita, then a gust of wind comes and blows around duck feathers, that grosses me out.  Then I look down on the metal grated table and see some sort of bird poo in-between the grates that my silverware was just sitting on, ick.  We moved inside.  Maybe some tablecloths would help?\n\nOh and also the tables on the patio are packed in so tightly you have to squeeze to get through, and the next table is like 5 inches away, not cool.  \n\nI think I'm going to reluctantly have to downgrade my 4star to 3 star.",0.0,0.9819008708000184

Benihana here has every last thing I want from a teppanyaki restaurant with one exception and that one exception was heart-rending.\n\nMy friend and I were seated on a Saturday evening with no reservations and no wait. The menu? Full of good choices. Then I see it. Singapore Sling, right on the drink menu. They made it the right way. Considering what is actually in a Singapore Sling, that is painfully uncommon. So even before the show and food, I'm already pleased.\n\nI order the spicy chicken and much to my surprise, it is properly spicy. There's no overcompensating flavorless spice, nor is it a sauce that has a faint hint of heat. It was as spicy as it should be. It was a case of mass market appeal done right. If you're wondering about the soup and salad beforehand, I skipped the salad and the soup was pretty good but really just the standard for teppanyaki restaurants.\n\nLike Jose G, I had the pleasure of Tuan as chef. He kept up a stream of wisecracks and terrible puns that had everyone chuckling through the performance. Definitely has the comedic chef routine down well and he read his audience just right.\n\nSo, the drink is five stars, the food is five stars, the chef is five stars, what could possibly be so tragic as to mar this otherwise amazing experience? Getting a drink refill was irritatingly difficult. Only halfway through the meal did I manage to catch the waitress. I say catch as she was clearly about to pass right on by. I wouldn't say she was unfriendly, just sadly inattentive.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'll almost certainly drop by here again even if I don't stay at the LVH. I'll just have to be extra vigilant about getting that second drink before I'm halfway done. I wish I had the opportunity for a second try before giving this review, just in case it was one streak of bad luck. I hate to hold back a star for something that in the grand scheme of dinner is not a huge deal, but I just don't find nearly enough places that can serve a proper Singapore Sling and being deprived of such for so long instills me with a sense of saudade and woe.\n\nSeriously though. Tuan rocked that grill. If you think I enjoy loquacious diatribes, you haven't seen my love for horrid puns. I don't know if Benihana actually earned the fifth star, but Tuan did and he works there so they can show it off too.",1.0,0.9505037665367126

We made it there for Sunday Brunch, which other reviewers has commented was terrific.  Unfortunately the experience did not live up to the reputation, and I'm wondering if the trend of super Chefs opening outposts in Las Vegas isn't fraught with peril.  Perhaps the local talent base doesn't support the aspiration and instead leaves us with a watered down version of greatness.  Sort of a parable for Vegas itself?\n\nThe restaurant itself is lovely, and we snagged a nice table outside on the patio, which was a beautiful, calm oasis.  Unfortunately things kinds of came off the rails shortly after this as a series of service and cooking gaffes made me wonder if the staff was perhaps a bit hung over from the previous night's escapades?\n\nWe ordered Oysters to start, then Croque Madame and Quiche for mains.  Approximately 30 minutes after placing our order the mains arrived.  As the Oysters has not yet arrived, we sent them back and asked for the Oysters.  The runner who brought the food did a good job of realizing the error, taking the food away without argument and sending over the manager. The manager also did a good job of being appropriately upset by the miscue, promising it was not up to their standard, and comped the offending oysters (which turned out to be quite good when they finally arrived).\n\nHopefully smooth sailing from this point forward.  No such luck.  The Croque and Quiche arrived.  The Croque was absolutely delicious and perfect.  The Brioche toast that underlay it was a triumph.  However the Quiche was luke warm, not hot.  At this point we'd waited long enough and were starving so the issue was registered with the manager but the quiche (which was otherwise delicious) was eaten.  \n\nFinally, in an attempt to redeem the challenging meal we ordered the Beignets.  They too arrived cold (not even warm) and were uninspiring.  An unfortunate end to an error prone meal.\n\nSince most of the other reviews raved about the service I can only assume that our experience was an anomaly, but I have nothing else to gauge Bouchon with.  I'll give Bouchon another try on my next visit to Vegas, but in the meantime this was not the experience I expected, or to which I believe Bouchon aspires.  Hopefully the poor beleaguered manager, who did his best to address a bad situation, succeeds in rectifying the issues.",0.0,0.9385080337524414

To be honest, when they listed empanadas on the menu, we decided we had to try it. But boy was that a mistake. It was pretty expensive, for such small dishes. We asked what size and how many empanadas we would get, it was only one small one for $8-9! So instead of tapas, we decided to order regular meals. We first ordered a Passion Fruit sangria. That was delicious, included some fresh chopped apple/orange/lemon, very refreshing, but not sure it was worth $15 for half a pitcher. The bread they served with the meal was also delicious, but they gave such a small basket, they couldn't refill it fast enough for us (nor for our ice water)! Sigh. For my meal, I went with the Meatball pizza for $11. The crust was thin and crispy and the pizza itself was pretty huge (couldn't finish it), but the oil from the cheese and meat just gathered in the middle of the plate and my crust soaked it all up. They also added some cherry tomatoes and basil, which definitely enhanced the flavor, but by the time my food came to me... the cheese already looked hardened. Disgusting. Unfortunately, the rest of our service wasn't that great either. Our waiter never came back for a water refill, and we actually finished eating our food and probably sat around for 5 minutes before flagging down another waitress for our bill. \n\nAlso, they include an 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more. What? Ok fine, can we give less? Whatever. Our meal came up to be $xx.90, so our friend wanted to break her 100 and get some change. They had the nerve to keep her extra 10 cents too, something about rounding up or some crap.

And we did enjoy the bread basket...although I could do without the bread with chunks of pineapple in it.\n\nGabi and I decided to share 2 entrees- both highly recommended by the waiter. In fact, he said they were 2 of the most popular dishes on the menu. What you ask? Hold your horses yelpers...I'm getting there! Macadamia crusted mahi mahi and some lo mein like dish topped with halibut.  Jared was eating his 2nd dinner of the evening so he decided to keep it light and ordered the won ton soup.

Every review I've read about Takeda Thai raves about the fancy facade and upscale interior of this small strip mall restaurant. I think belief is suspended at the door, as most reviewers go on to praise the food. Phoenix Magazine even rated it one of the 23 best new restaurants in its October issue. That actually is my reason for writing this entry - to give a dissenting view.\n\nFor lunch today, we ordered pad thai ($7.95 from the lunch menu, $13.95 at dinner), garlic mini pork ribs ($10.95) and angel wings ($11.95) from the appetizer section.\nOur very nice waitress brought us two bowls of soup instead of the one we were entitled to. It was a mild chicken soup with a few vegetables and some tofu floating in it. OK, certainly not notable. Then the rest of the dishes came out. I was truly shocked by the plate of riblets. There were 6 tiny riblets on a bed of wilted lettuce. Remember, these cost $10.95!!! They had been fried to death and had no garlic taste. I looked closely at the lettuce and noticed a few bits of overly browned garlic sprinkled on it. These clearly had never touched the ribs. This was downright insulting. The portion size of the angel wings was somewhat better. Angel wings are large chicken wings which have been boned and stuffed with vegetables, minced chicken and glass noodles, then fried and sliced. Like the riblets, these had been overcooked and were totally dried out. The insipid \""sweet and sour chili dip\"" tasted only of sugar, and dunking the slices of wing in it did not revive them. Somehow the \""chef\"" even managed to turn out dry pad thai with a horrible fishy back taste. When our waitress came over and asked which was our favorite thing, the only answer I could give was \""the service\"". Our cost, even with a 10% discount coupon, came to $40.\n\nI guess I could give the restaurant and its reviewers the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps since it was lunch time a talented chef was not on duty. However, if that's the case, and no one better than the person who was in the kitchen could be found, then lunch should not be served\n\nThe only review I read that got it even partly right was from AZ Central. It said \""the kitchen assumes you don't want to play with fire, so everything here is mild enough to feed a newborn.\""\n\nI hope you won't think I'm a grouch, but I did want to warn you.",0.0,0.9975141286849976

It just so happens that they occupy the exact same space, employ the same people, and have the same name.\n\nI'd initially been wary of Posh - \""Improvisational Cuisine\"" conjured images of people slapping \""mystery meat\"" onto plastic cafeteria trays.  But a positive review on \""Check Please Arizona\"" changed my mind, and we went for Restaurant Week.  \n\nEverything was top-notch, from service to wine selections to the food (although I was upset I only got to TRY the kangaroo, as it was quite tasty).  Given the food allergies/likes/dislikes within our group, it was nice to see that everyone was fully considered and accounted for.  Five stars all around!  Not a single thing we didn't like!  An amazing restaurant and concept!  Other cries of jubilation and deliciousness!  In short, we decided that Posh was great, but a \""special event\"" kind of place, given the non-RW prices and the fact that none of us are millionaires (yet).\n\nWe came back for my birthday (the specialest of all occasions), and sadly, it wasn't the Posh we went to the first time.  On three separate dishes, requests weren't met (and two of them related to health/allergy requests), service was sloppy, and some of the food just wasn't that good.  My soft shell crab was a little bland, and the frog's legs I got for my entree weren't too impressive.  Also, one of the appetizers was a salad, with lettuce, cheese, haricot vert and salami.  That was it.  I'm sure that the ingredients were top-notch, but it seemed a bit sparse compared to some of the other offerings at our table.  It was like someone had asked us what we liked about the place last time and marked down most of our positives as \""things to get rid of next time they're in.\""  Dessert was good, though.\n\nAs much as I'd like to give Posh a top rating, I cannot do so with any real confidence.

The small amount of meat on the nachos had that dark crusted over color on the top and we should have known from that point on but they were $14 so we ate about 1/3 of the order. We both ordered the up the skirt steak, it was pretty good but again we both ended up with food poisoning -though I can't say if it was the steak or the nachos that got us. I tried the green tea frozen drink and it was way too sweet for me but they were kind and switched it out for me.  Our server was nice, he was really busy so another guy (mgr?) took our order for us and brought us water which was nice.

While we arrived pretty early (5:30) and it was a Monday, I was surprised that we were the only ones in the restaurant.  This didn't change until around 6:15 when another table was seated.  \nThe inside of the restaurant is sleek with a modern decor.  The open kitchen was immaculate and the staff welcoming.

The rice cakes themselves were also very good.\nThe other two small plates really didn't hit the mark.  While not \""bad\"", they weren't something I would try again.\nThe sweetness of the dates completely overpowered the goat meat stuffing.  They were almost cloyingly sweet and needed an acid to help balance it out.  \nThe duck breast was very ho-hum.  The meat was prepared nicely, sliced in small medallions over a puree of sweet potatoes.  This would have been fine but a \""foam\"" of Crispin cider did absolutely nothing for the dish.  Looking more like spittle than foam, it seemed out of place and awkward.  Why take what I would call a \""humble dish\"" (it also was accompanied with root vegetables) and try to spiff it up with foam?\nAs my date and I discussed this more, I realized that the confusion around this dish carries over to the theme of the entire menu and restaurant.  What truly is 43 North?  It calls itself a modern bistro but neither the food nor the decor embraces \""bistro\"".  Looking at the menu, is it Mediterranean?  Asian? New American?  I think this confusion is causing diners to not flock here.  No doubt, there is skill in the kitchen and the meals it puts out.

Service started very well, but went downhill fast. \n\nWe started both appetizer specials of the day.  \n\nThe first - deep fried meatballs - was okay; nothing to write home about. We later added them to our entrees, and they felt like they belonged better there. \n\nThe second - a selection of 2 each of their popular appetizers -was a mixed bag. Fried mozarella sticks and fried ravioli were both tasty.  Calamari was soggy and limp. The real problem was the shared dipping sauce which was just plain bland and boring. Adding crushed chili peppers gave it a bit of a bite, but it was still a losing cause. Squirting fresh lemon on the calamari did nothing to help the taste and just made them soggier. . \n\nThe main course was spaghetti bolognese (we asked, and they substituted fettuccine) and this dish was just adequate.  It felt like they had added too much cream to the red sauce, and it was smooth and orange, instead of lumpy and bright red. I hate to say this, but the bolognese sauce at even the Olive Garden is much better. After we'd started eating, the waitress came over and apologized that she had forgotten to bring us our salad.  She offered to pack it to go, but we declined.  \n\nAfter we'd finished, we just waited and waited and waited.

The restaurant was not particularly busy and we could see the two waitresses standing in the kitchen watching the cooks at work.  About 20 mins after we had finished, we were finally able to catch the attention of the maitre d' who finally summoned one of the waitresses for us.\n\nTerrible service notwithstanding, the food itself was simply too bland and boring to consider giving this place another chance.

I was real curious of their lobster roll but unfortunately it got taken off the menu a few weeks prior. We also wanted to know, is this the best burger in Vegas? \n\nGrilled fish tacos - these were pretty decent. The fish were fresh and came 2 to a order. I like the grilled pepper and onion on the side - just like San Diego tacos. It came with their fries which were wonderfully sprinkled with fried herbs that added something special to their very crisp thin fry. \n\nSteakhouse burger- we asked for medium rare and it came out well done, no pink at all. We haven't eaten a red meat in 5 months so it made me sad that rare meat meal was not. It was juicy enough for a well done burger so I can still tell it was quality meat. The bun was nice and the sweet carmelized onion-y BBQ sauce was fantastic. I dipped the fries in only that So far, to answer my own question - Bradley Ogden still wins. \n\nThe manager here was really great about it though and was apologetic and asked if he can get us a dessert. We got a coconut panna cotta w/ mango and a pink pepper merengue crisp. Desserts here are a strong point as all the desserts we've had here impressed the BF who normally doesn't give a crap about after dinner desserts.\n\nService was alright during the meal. It trailed off in the end when we were given our check but was held hostage by our server. Nothing gets me more antsy than that. I can wait for good food. I can excuse a bit if it is really busy. When you know a person it trying to leave I would get back to them in 1-2 mins of dropping it off instead of going off. Not also the time you want to make a guest anxious as it is the closest time to tip time. \n\nBetween the burger and the hostage situation, I think dropping a star is fair. I would go during dinner though. From my last reviews, there's this bartender with glasses and this one male server who is a absolute veteran that will make it shine.

We initially thought of OLIVE GARDEN! Unfortunately the wait was 20 mins. Again, we were starving...NO CAN DO. Anyway, we decided to go to Golden Corral since it was next door and the line was decent for dinner (so they say). We said, what the heck...we'll wait for a little bit. At least it's an all you can eat buffet! \n\nUpon getting my first plate, I was super excited. This was my first time and I wanted to see what the hype was all about. To sum it all up...THIS PLACE SUCKS! I'm sorry but I've eaten at most of the restaurants in this neighborhood and almost every single one is bomb! It wasn't the case for this spot! \n\nHow can you really mess up on fried rice? It was horrible! It left a weird nasty after-taste in my mouth. The rice pilaf was bland and dry that I had to add butter to make it somewhat decent. Fried chicken tasted like cardboard and you can tell that it's frozen! Clam chowder was thin and salty. My medium rare steak was so dry and tough that when I attempted to cut it, my cheap fork bent! Mint chocolate chip ice cream tasted like topical anesthesia from the dentist! Peach cobbler's dough was starchy and gross! Ugh! The only thing that I loved was the honey butter biscuits and the meatloaf wasn't bad either. That's about it though. Pretty sad that out of all those choices, I only found two great things. \n\nI'm not a picky eater and my palette is pretty open but I sure do know what quality food taste like and this obviously isn't it. I'd take quality over quantity any day! I do not recommend this place unless you want to eat hospital quality food...actually, I take that back...at least hospital food is tasty! Never again will we come back here! And if the restaurant is reading this, we the customers would appreciate better quality food if you're going to charge $12 for dinner and still charge for our drinks too. Unbelievable!

As I was dining alone, I was offered a choice of a seat by the cooking area (a backless stool) or a booth. I chose the booth, as those stools looked very uncomfortable. The upstairs has dining tables and the cooking area for seating. The place is dim and reasonably quiet, very stark, almost monastic decor. I had my heart set on shrimp and grits, but wanted the waiter's opinion on what was best. After learning he felt the shrimp and grits were the best in CLT, I went for it. As the menu advertised they had bread baked special for them at King's Bakery, I was surprised no bread basket was offered or provided. My food arrived and it looked and smelled amazing. Four shrimp, some andouille sausage and grits in a spicy red sauce. The grits were very coarsely ground, which became an issue, as I kept getting unexpected, sharp pieces of corn husk in my mouth. The dish was quite good, except for the grits. One doesn't expect sharp anything in grits. The waiter returned immediately after I received my plate and before I tasted the food, then never returned except to collect my check, leaving my order in the hands of the busboy (who was quite nice and helpful). The busboy offered me a dessert menu (I passed as desserts are $8 a pop and all I wanted was a bite of something sweet), got me my check and was genuinely attentive (something I can't say for the waiter).

We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My \""short rib\"" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I'm not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey's pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot.

Our food came rather quickly considering there was only ONE waiter for the entire restaurant.. But! They fell short on food quality. My chicken was not cooked thoroughly, and was still veryy pink/red on the inside. And there was even some blood on my mashed potatoes from the uncooked chicken. If I thought that was bad; My broccoli florets still had the rubber and around it, and I almost ate it! This also signified to me that they did not clean my broccoli well, and this was bad for business. On a much lighter note, I did let our waiter know, & they did take it off the bill, as well as sent over someone to apologize to us for the chicken dish. Phew! I was just glad to get that off the bill, because there was no way I was going to pay for that few bites of chicken that I had and NOT complain. Kudos to them for making it that much easier on them and myself. \n\nMy mother ordered their salmon dish, & the salmon was still kind of raw. How raw? It left the rice extremely moist! It was edible, but not very good. My Dad and sister barely ate their food, & just took it in boxes to go.\n\nThe second time that I came here it was for breakfast. It was just me and my Mom.

Italian bread with olive oil and rosemary to dunk it in, fan-tas-tic, I'm starved! But only a supermarket would try to pass that bread as \""eyetalian\"" and the olive oil was 100% tasteless.

Caesar what???\n\nI ordered pork chops in Marsala sauce and I finally understand why people gave good ratings to Fontanella ... believe or not the sauce here is actually WORSE, little porcini mushrooms totally overpowered by the salt shaker that was emptied in the sauce. And the Marsala forget it, there was NONE to be tasted, what's this prohibition era wine sauce. I wanted to just eat it and put an end to this ordeal, but the salt overdose made it impossible. The executive chef came out and met me. They served another pork chop (although the plate called for two of them) without the salt overdose but again without marsala or any significant seasoning. \n\nBack in the 90s I used to do go to bike week in Daytona quite often.

Okay, enough of that rant...\n\nPLUS: We had some delicious salads. A prosciutto & melon salad and the classic Caprese. Big props for these two!\n\nThe bread: Yess, we were fans. One of them tasted like pan pizza crust..the whole table agreed. So good! \n\nMeals:\n--Pappardelle: Wide noodles served with sausage and wild mushrooms. I was looking so forward to this dish, and I think it only fell short in my eyes because of its sauce-- or, rather, its lack thereof. There was NO sauce, just an almost excessive amount of melted butter covering the dish. It was good, but almost a tad bland. My mom and sister enjoyed this dish, though. \n\n--\""Mama Egi's\"" ravioli: Either order this as an appetizer, or split this and another dish with someone else at the table. Extremely delicious, but also extremely rich. I couldn't eat more than four or five of these mini raviolis without wanting to stop because it was so rich. \n\n--Quail. I had never had quail before, and my sister's boyfriend ordered this dish. I only had a bite, but I liked what I tasted. He said it was better than what he was used to. \n\nDessert:\nWe ordered the bombolonis (donuts)-- ooh, sugar-covered goodness. Came with a raspberry sauce and a strong chocolate sauce. \n\nOverall, Circo wasn't bad. It wasn't bad at all. It had its strong points, but also fell short in some areas.

When Julie K had posted a talk thread informing us of the Groupon Reserve, 2 for $99, I jumped on it figuring there wouldn't be better time to try it. Made a reservation for 10:30, arrived on time, and was seated an hour later. An hour. I guess they figure my time isn't valuable, I could've slept in longer! Finally we were seated but didn't have our drink ordered taken for another 10 minutes, as we were sitting there I was noticing the decor, I felt like I was in a Cosby Show episode, the ambiance was very strange. 80's theme all the way. Started out at the station with the broiled lobster tails, seemed to look good, they were split in half so I grabbed a couple, these were decent but nothing spectacular. I skipped the carving station as I'm not a huge meat eater so I can't comment on that. The entire warming station was set up like a catering type deal, all the food is in a metal flip top with fire under neath so all the food had that hardened layer on top. Not appetizing at all. Went over to the sushi station, ordered hamachi and tako, when I got to the table, I noticed how hard the fish was, I wasn't brave enough to try it. The caviar was scooped from a bucket type thing, I gave it a try but spit it out. It was so warm. I tried the oysters which were stacked on a plate sitting on ice, again when I returned to the table I noticed how smelly they were. So I was too nervous to try them. All the while we were barely checked on my our server, we had maybe 3 refills of PJ (that's basically the best part of the meal so far) we ended up eating mostly crab legs and a few crab claws. The desserts were comparable to Costco, we tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, ehh. It gives me no pleasure to complain about this entire meal/experience but I cannot see how this was a great experience from anyone? We tipped on the full amount, so this still was a $70 meal.

Also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was right by KA, it won!\n\nWe were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on Sunday, but still busy]. The decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass \""walls\""]. The restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for KA and was right near the MGM casino. My friend noticed after dinner that there were a ton of servers, but only one female server which was quite the opposite of... everywhere! \n\nThe waiter seemed very jazzed about dinner and explaining everything, and we were worried when he didn't write anything down, but he was awesome! Braden was nice, funny, got everything right, and he was great about checking in with us. Our water glasses were always full, and our food was amazing! There were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].\n\nMy mouth was watering just reading the menu, but I wasn't feeling great so I thought I'd pick smaller options--hah! I got Mac'n Cheese and Roasted Cauliflower. The Mac'n Cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. Two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. My sister got the gourmet burger. It was $25 and SO worth it! She asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful! It came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. I believe my boyfriend got the Italian sausage pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size. \n\nThe only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery. We agreed that this place was pretty great, and if we're ever in Vegas again we'll have to try one of Puck's other restaurants! \n\nLast bit--they had quite a large group in there at several long tables, so they can accommodate big groups!",1.0,0.9983987212181092
