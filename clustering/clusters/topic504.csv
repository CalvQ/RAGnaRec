The \""fresh\""  fruit that accompanied the omelet didn't look that fresh. I couldn't say for sure because, like the omelet, I didn't eat it.  I originally asked for home fries with my omelet, but was told it just came with fruit. My friend ate some of her blueberry pancakes. They were o.k. but not memorable. No care was taken with either the preparation or presentation of the food. This place should not be in business. We felt very uncomfortable there and couldn't wait to leave. We will not under any circumstances be back. When we got the bill, it looked as though the guy didn't charge me for the omelet. Nor should he have.

I was especially excited to visit after finding out there was a great place for breakfast that was on the travel network (man vs. food). I am a true food lover and Food Network and Travel Channel must really love pittsburgh. They are always on man vs food and diners, drive ins and dives. \nI found out the hard way that just because you are showcased on a dandy show doesn't mean your food is up to par. \nJust to make it very clear I am a southerner. I did however go to delucas with my girlfriend who was born and raised in pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. So I was able to look past the brash attitude of the person at the register yelling at my girlfriend instead of seating us. She however was pretty turned off by it. \nThere wasn't a wait. We got seated pretty quickly after my girlfriend had to let the lady know we were there well before the ambush of people that poured in after we arrived. (that's when my girlfriend got yelled at) \nAfter being seated I was really excited about the food. The place was hoppin and the coffee was really good. The menu had a huge list of things to choose from. I thought it was going to be a great place. I had really high hopes.\nThe server we had was ok. Not very friendly but efficient. She was the shorter of the two I saw. We kind of wished we had the tall girl. She seemed a lot more friendly. \nWe didn't wait too long to get our food but when we got it you would have thought it would have taken a couple hours. I got the biscuits and gravy (one of my favorite breakfast foods) and potatoes. They were both stone cold. The gravy on the biscuits was more like a soup and the potatoes were well cold. I really couldn't get passed the fact that my food was cold. \nMy girlfriend got the california omelette with potatos and fruit with the Italian toast. She like the fruit and toast but that was it. I almost choked on my sausage gravy when I saw her omelette. It was practically black. I know sometimes people over cook eggs. It's not cool but it happens. How do you even send eggs out that are practically black. I guess at least it was hot. Her potatoes needless to say were also cold.\nI was really looking forward to eating at a delicious breakfast place in pittsburgh. I was disappointed.",0.0,0.7668762803077698

Vegas is actually pretty reasonable and not crowded and you can get good/decent service at most establishments when you run on business time rather than on party time.  I ate here recently while staying at TI during a work trip (seriously...people do go to vegas for reasons other than partying).\n\nAnyways, my boss and I stopped in for breakfast before checking out on our last morning.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The portions were big, but not outrageously so. Good value (of course). Not too greasy. Above average diner food. \n\nThe boss had french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast came with all the fixings - powdered sugar, syrup and butter.  Boss-lady enjoyed her morning heart attack meal.  The waitress only flinched once when she asked for MORE powdered sugar to accompany the already powder-white french toast.  \n\nI had a standard 2-eggs, bacon, hash brown and toast meal.  Everything was pretty good for what it is. It was surprisingly (pleasantly so) not overly greasy. I was pleased to find my scrambled eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked, and not covered in grease. The bacon was also crispy and not too greasy (I wonder if they are actually cooking their bacon in the oven and letting the fat drip off).  Toast was standard. Nothing was overcooked which is surprising in this day and age of hypochondriacs and under-developed food palettes. The coffee was a tinge stronger than one would expect.\n\nPrices were fair (although my boss did complain that her side of bacon was about $8...but she did get like 6 or 7 pieces of bacon with that order...which seems fair since most places charge $2-3 for a side of bacon with 2 pcs).\n\nThe service was good. We never had to ask for coffee refills. Out waitress was nice enough.  She wasn't speedy but wasn't slow either. No complaints here.\n\nThe place is decent and convenient if you are staying at the TI or are in the TI and happen to be hungry at that moment. There's no reason to go out of your way to eat here but it will do when you need a bite.",1.0,0.994903802871704

We were seated at the bar and so I was able to watch them cook.  While they were juggling a bunch of dishes, I did notice that the cook put the eggs in to \""poach\"" and left them forever.  Of course, when I got my meal, the eggs were so overcooked, they weren't even edible.  I would have returned the dish, but couldn't get any waitstaff's attention.  So, I ate the sides and some of my friend's food, which was excellent.

After the 3rd attempt of making my waffle, it was placed on a plate and sat under the warmer for a good 20 minutes or so.

Now, ya gotta understand, at $4.99, you aren't getting a filet, a T-Bone, or even a rib eye. You're getting a slab of meat that's grilled the way you order  (med-rare for me), and the accompanying steak knife. You need this knife, cuz the meat is a bit on the tough side. But, as I said above, for $4.99, this is what you should expect to get. I was not disappointed, nor should you be if you go for the $4.99 steak and egg special. The eggs were prefect, and the two slices of rye toast were pre-buttered. The potatoes were done as I asked, and had some bell peppers and onions mixed in. Good stuff. \n\nThe nearby hotel I stay in has the usual morning breakfast, and I was just tired of the all-carb offering. I was after some protein. This filled the bill. I think I'll make this a regular every other week stop. \n\nSince I was the ONLY customer in the place for most of my visit, it was quiet as a tomb. When another gentleman came in, it was STILL this quiet. I'm sure later in the day, life picks up. I wish I could check this place out in the evening, but my job prevents it. Drat! I live in Reno, so my chances of stopping by in the evening are nil (unless they shut down Hwy 95 and I can't GET back to Reno).",0.0,0.9846839308738708

The place was spotless and the huge floor-to-ceiling windows along the front meant that the restaurant is not only light and airy, but is also a great place for people-watching.\n\nI had the Eggs Benedict (\u00a36.50) topped with crispy bacon and hollandaise sauce, although I have to admit that there were so many things to choose from on the breakfast menu I was one of those annoying people that waitresses hate, who constantly need \""two more minutes\"" - the cheese & ham croissant or the stacked buttermilk pancakes with crispy bacon and maple syrup sounded hard to pass up.\n\nOn that note, after a brief glance at the lunch menu I'd say breakfast/brunch is definitely the best time to go. Whilst the lunch menu looked good, and there was a separate Lighter Options section, the wraps/sandwiches/salads on offer did sound quite run-of-the-mill in comparison to the breakfasts.\n\nAlthough the name is somewhat misleading, given that it has been under new management since 2008 and is definitely more Double Mediterranean then Double Dutch, I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.",1.0,0.9591548442840576

It was decent, but that's about it.  It was very busy at 11am on a Sunday morning which was a good sign.  Took a bit before our waitress came by to take our drink order but she was obviously slammed and you could tell she was trying.  We were ready to place our order, but I asked what she recommended more...the veggie omelet or the chipotle veggie burger.  She said the burger is really good, but recommended I get the omelet because they were out of the \""good\"" buns and only had potato buns left.  So I ordered the omelet...without mushrooms.  The BF was planning on getting the \""bring it on\"" burger, but got the Tryst omelet instead after hearing about the bun shortage.  We also each ordered a glass of fresh squeezed o.j. ($5 each).  Seemed a little pricy, but whatever.  We had $30 to spend.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly considering how busy they were.  First off, my omelet had mushrooms.  Not that big of a deal.  They were portobello slices so they came out easily.  The grilled onions were undercooked in my opinion and were big fat slices.  I'd have preferred them a little smaller or thinner or something.  The whole thing just lacked flavor and was really kind of greasy.  I've had way better omelets in my day.  The BF really liked his omelet.  Said the roasted tomatoes were incredible.  His was supposed to come with sweet potato tater tots, but he got sweet potato fries instead.  Maybe they were out of tots too.  \n\nAll in all, decent, but I'm glad I had a $15 for $30 certificate.  Our bill before tax came to exactly $30 dollars.  I think $15 for an omelet and o.j. Is kind of a lot.  Not sure if we'll be going back or not.",0.0,0.9965489506721495

A friend of mine suggested it, and since it had been a few months since my last visit, I thought maybe it had gotten better since then and wanted to give it another chance. While it's not any worse than it was, it's definitely not any better. My impressions of this experience:\n\n--There were only maybe 4 or 5 other tables in the place, yet both times I wanted a refill on my coffee, I had to request one. This was in spite of the fact that our server had been to our table to check on us and must have seen that our cups were empty. He was right on top of taking payment once we finished our food, though.\n\n--The server was nice, however, and made sure to check that over easy eggs on the BEC sandwich were ok for my pregnant friend to eat.\n\n--The coffee was still really good. The coffee and the friendliness were the only really good things about this visit. Everything else was eh.\n\n--The BEC sandwich cost $8 and was about the same size as a Starbucks breakfast sandwich (which costs half as much) but didn't even taste as good. The slab of bacon (which was ham-style, super thick bacon) was greasy and flavorless. The whole thing was just bland and seemed like it needed some kind of sauce or seasoning. While I can appreciate the fact that this is a farm-to-table, sit-down dining experience, I would expect to get something at least as good if not better tasting than what a giant chain coffee shop is offering. \n\n--The menu is still in that weird, hard-to-decipher format. My friend couldn't figure out what to order because they're still just listing ingredients and neglecting preparation/presentation. I sort of knew what to expect, but some of the newer items were totally cryptic.\n\n--\""Liver mush\"" has got to be the most disgusting name for a dish that I've ever heard. It might be good. I wouldn't know, because the name sounded so awful that I didn't dare try it.\n\nLittle Spoon continues to be an okay experience at a premium price. I love the location. I love the space. PLEASE step up the food game and make your menu format more approachable! It baffles me that such good ingredients are being used to prepare such average-tasting items. This place could and should be miles better.",0.0,0.997886598110199
