The first time, I came here, this club was off the chain. They had lapdance beds, and had some nice, young, white woman, walking around that joint. As you can you see, from my first review, of this place, I had a good time. Well, it has changed, since then. I came in at 4pm, and the club was deader than a 85 year hooker, in Alaska. They had one stripper in there, that was about 6'2, that looked like former Boston Celtic, Kevin McChale. The bartender, was smoking HOT, though. When the bartender is the best looking girl in the club, that is not good. She is a sweetheart, as well. The D.J was really cool, too.One change, that I did like, was that this place, serves alcohol ,now. By the look of the strippers, in this place, I can see why.Now to all fairness, of this place, I left at like 7pm. I did see some cute strippers coming in, so Im not going to give up on this place, just yet. I just wish they could hire better looking strippers during the daytime.",0.0,0.962424099445343

It's located in the center of the club, and where most clubs will line up as many chairs as they can fit around it, they actually have small tables that fit 2-3 chairs each going around the edge of the stage.

Word of advice get there early (it is a bit dead in beginning) and if you have hot friends you may be able to get in free, which most of the party did, while I got separate from the herd since some guys cut in front of me (yes, such gentlemen) and I ended having to pay the $20 cover (which is standard) since the staff couldn't care less that most of my party was in and since I have no game and apparently not hot, be ready to pay.  There are plenty of poles to dance from which the bachelorette party utilized. Most of the crowd is pretty friendly and one gal I meet there even earned a $100 for dancing.  The security doesn't like dry humping which I'm completely fine with and was pretty amazed to see them pulled off some guys very happy to see some of our bachelorette party members. Oh...youngens.  The gogo dancers were just okay, one or two were really good but some could have been better.  It's huge but IMHO the d\u00e9cor is just okay, guess I'm really over the whole mega club. Lounges and good music for this old fogey.",1.0,0.993396520614624

Also noticed there were one or two bachelorette parties being celebrated at the same time.\n\nThe bartender was also very helpful.
