What a relieved both to my body and to my mind.  I have hurt my neck many years ago from exercising.  From time to time, my nerve was pressed and I have pain shooting down all the way to my right wrist!  I can't even shoot a basketball.  Since I move away from Chicago 4 years ago, My husband and I have tried different doctors in HK and Arizona.  Unfortunately, our only relieved was seeing our doctor (who we considered the best chiropractor we have known) when we go back to Chicago to visit family.  I also bought two machines to stretch and massage my neck from time to time to ease the pain.  Things is going to change since I visited Dr. Tikey today!  We were referred by our massager and we decided to give it another try.  Dr. Tikey knows his thing!  I can tell he is a good doctor as he started to touch me and he is so attentive to the part that cost me pain.  I feel so much better after seeing him and I am overjoy to find a good chiropractor here.  By the way, he is even better than my doctor in Chicago!  He didn't charge $200 for the first visit which surprised me because I was treated w/a back stretching bed, electric wave therapy, and the treatment from the doctor.  $200 was definitely one of the reason why we hesitated to try a new chiropractor even though mine wasn't doing a good job.  \n\nDr. Tikey, thank you!  We are coming back!",1.0,0.9945989847183228

Mayo Mercedes Wardle, the owner/acupuncturist, has set up a great space to help locals have accessible, affordable treatments. Whether you want treatments for general wellness or a specific ailment or affliction, she will cater the treatments for you and your goals. \nI went for my first treatment with my husband. The atmosphere is very serene with low lighting, aromatherapy, soothing music and reclining chairs. You can schedule a treatment by yourself or go in with friends/family. You can also just drop-in during Mayo's hours of operation, if you happen to be in the area. I plan to bring a couple friends with me next time. It is a community concept clinic, which means you are likely to see other people there getting treatment (you don't have to talk to others getting treatment, but if they are just starting or just ending their treatment, feel free to say hi). Today I met a yoga instructor who teaches at one of the top yoga studios in town. \nThe sliding scale is awesome because it allows you to determine what is affordable to you, from $15-35 per treatment. Mayo wants the treatment to be affordable, so that you can continue to come in and enjoy the benefits of acupuncture, whether it's weekly or every other week. There is water for purchase ($1 donation to the karma piggy bank) and there is a bathroom available for patrons. Mayo also offers free treatments to new clients on the first Friday of every month.",1.0,0.9992207288742064

She also explained why she was putting needles in certain places.  I enjoyed my experience in the space. The chairs are set up in a circle creating a nice flow.

I also sit at a desk hunched over a computer all day, so the pain in my neck and upper back is bound to come back from time to time. The last time I was in, I complained of some minor pain in my hip. Like a ninja she inserted a couple of needles into the area and within 48 hours the pain was gone. It had been bothering me for 4 weeks. I have been going to see Dr. Richman for about 6 months now. She runs a great practice. I show up on time, I am treated on time. What a concept? The pricing is extremely fair and she also gave me some exercise tips to strengthen the muscles in the back.
