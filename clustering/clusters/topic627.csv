Great fried rice and the food always tastes fresh. Only bummer is they stopped making home made spring rolls but the egg rolls are still homemade and good. Chinese food places can be a hit or miss just lucky enough to live next to a good one",1.0,0.9998570680618286

You can tell alot about a place by their fried rice. The vegetable fried rice was excellent with fresh cut mushrooms and other veggies and not just frozen peas and carrots. The $1.25 egg roll was not good though, although perhaps they gave me a spring roll instead because the wrapper was not egg roll style. Could possibly try the real food here at some point, but rice was a good start.",1.0,0.9823688864707948

I discovered that they revamped the menu entirely. Now you pick a protein and a sauce. No more combos :(\n\nI decided to have chicken with spicy Korean sauce and brown rice. We also shared an order of lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were as expected. My dish came out and it didn't look like what I expected, but I was hopeful and waited until James got his to dig in. I took a bite of the chicken and whatever flavoring was nonexistent. It was not spicy and really had no taste. I added some soy sauce to the brown rice and for brown rice, it didn't taste good either. I ended up taking just a few bites and leaving the rest. I will reluctantly give them a second chance since I did try something new, but I really wouldn't recommend what I got to anyone.",0.0,0.9952772855758668

Their chicken pho has more of a Chinese wonton soup broth, but it's still very good if you're feeling a cold coming on. They also do a great job with rice dishes, my favorite is #58. The rest of other dishes they offer like spring rolls and Vietnamese sandwiches are good, but nothing to rave about. Although, they do offer very good boba drinks. It's arguably better than Viet Kitchen and Pho Thanh. I go here all the time for the past two years and highly recommend.",1.0,0.9997119307518004

I also tried pork adobo and it was watery, not the way I wanted it to be.  I recycled it the next day and it turn out tastier than when I got it from them.  They also doubled charge me with the rice when, I didn't even ordered it.  Oh well, At least I gave it a try, 2 times.  I don't think I'm going back there ever again.

It was okay but I'm still looking for something awesome out here in Goodyear and this simply isn't it.
