Sometimes the convenience is worth it, though.\n\nAs for the service, it's a mixed bag.

The story goes thus:  several years ago Bob and their daughter Betsy took a father-daughter trip to Las Vegas.  When they flew home they brought Lois a box of Ethel M chocolates, but they forgot it on the plane.  After hearing the story, I went to the Ethel M website when we got home and ordered an assortment of my choosing.  I don't remember the details of how this happened, but I inadvertently ordered two of the same thing.  I called Customer Service, where I spoke to a lovely woman who took the second charge off the bill, despite the fact that both orders were going out.  I guess once the process is set in motion it can't be called back.  So Lois received two boxes of chocolates.  She froze one of them so I could taste it when we visited this year.\n\nWe arrived this past week and Lois dug the box out of the freezer.  One of the things I had found frustrating in creating my own assortment is that they limited me to 4 choices, so that made for a very limited assortment, leading to a bit of monotony, at least as much monotony is possible when we're talking chocolate.  The chocolates were good, probably about the level of See's, but not rising to the level of Chocolatier Blue or Christopher Elbow or any Belgian chocolate purveyor.  But they were better than Whitman's or Hershey's or other commercial grade chocolates sold in drugstores.  I wouldn't turn them down if they were offered but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy them again either.  Lois, who is extremely tactful, couldn't hide her disappointment in them after waiting all these years for a taste.  3.51 stars, w/ extra points for excellent customer service, rounded up to 4.",0.0,0.9914032816886902

The service is fantastic - I was in the door for a second before being fed melt-in-your-mouth tasters of their own strawberries and cream flavoured variety.

My overzealous reactions caused the visitors to get stuck in to the taster bowl too, so the shop owner seemed happy. They are very informative and good at communicating the ingredients to you. A lot of the fudge is their own recipe, handed down for generations. It's still made in the shop to this day, and if you enter at the right time of day you may see it being cut up.\n\nIt's almost a fiver for one big slab of the fudge. But it's like a cake, and without a doubt the best fudge I've tasted. You can also get discount if you buy gift boxes, making it one of the best presents you could hope to take home if you are a tourist.\n\nIf my boyfriend had to pick between fudge and sex, I would almost expect him to pick fudge.

If you like chocolate, you will LOVE The Chocolate Tree. Located in the trendy Bruntsfield area, it is in the perfect position to sit in and gorge or sit out and gorge. Their chocolates are all organic (so at least your conscious feels good about eating copious amounts of chocolate...)\n\nThe decor is very chic, trendy and indulgent. Indeed, I think Indulgence is a theme in the cafe. My first visit was under sad circumstances - recently single and feeling vulnerable, my friend took me and ordered me the 'Spanish Hot Chocolate' (see picture). Oh My God. Where I was feeling despairing, distraught and dismayed I was overcome with delight, deliriousness and felt thoroughly delectable!! It was perfect...perhaps a bit rich, but the first few sips were to die for. It even came with a little dough cake-thing to dip into the thick, gloopy chocolate, like fondue! It would have been ideal for two to share.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not what you would call a choc-a-holic - especially now that Cadbury's is no longer considered 'chocolate'. But there is something for everyone to enjoy, whether its a slice of their GLORIOUS chocolate cake (it was delicious, after a while I felt I should find a mirror to check if my pupils had dilated) or one of their mini chocolate bites.\n\nIf you can't make it to the shop they sell online and they're much cheaper than their competition ( it's one of their ethical principles, woohoo!). It really is worth visiting, on a warm summer day to lounge and indulge yourself, or on a cold winter evening to keep yourself warm.

When she came back and our server saw that she had a bag - she asked if we received the 10% discount. We were unaware of the discount and she promptly applied the discount and gave us our money back.

After getting a sample of the milk chocolate Italian hot chocolate and not being too impressed with it, we decided to go inside to get our drinks.

I was pretty disappointed with the first half or so of the drink.  It was really runny and flavorless.  It wasn't until I got to the bottom that I started to enjoy my drink more.  All the marshmallows were at the bottom so it added more flavor to it.  If not I would've had to give this place a lower rating!  \n\nI had read about the chocolate chip walnut cookie so we had to give it a try.  It's a pricey cookie (about $5) but it's huge and worth it!  It is thick and ooey and gooey and warm with delicious chocolate flavor!

He was MIA from the counter for awhile but then again he had double duty, taking care of both the dining customers and the walk-up customers at the counter.  The bartender inside the restaurant though, not so friendly, but she was slammed with dessert drink orders.  \n\nIn all the hot chocolate ended up being okay but I have definitely had better.  For people in northern California, Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento has the best hot chocolate, full of flavor from first sip to last and marshmallow flavor from first sip to - and especially with - the last.  Monique's Chocolates in Palo Alto has the next best hot chocolate in my opinion.

The \""Fantastic\"" was essentially a little mini-bar of chocolate wafer balls, rich milk chocolate fondue, and toasted candied hazelnut bits to top the vanilla ice cream cone.  Heaven on a cone.

Chocolate in every form imaginable.  It's very Wonka-like with pipes of liquid chocolate running overhead.  We've tried several items, both sweet and savory from their menu.  The prices are high at this restaurant, as one might expect, since it is owned by a celebrity chef and located in the Caesar's Forum Shops mall.  While tasty and high quality, the several savory items we've tried are not worth the high price.  We liked their mac and cheese (very cheesy with a crispy topping and yummy tomato sauce on the side).  Their chicken fingers and waffle fries were solid, but not quite as special as the mac and cheese.\n\nAs is Mr. Brenner's specialty, the desserts are the highlight here.  Three items stand out to us.  Our very favorite item here is a cocktail - the Satisfaction Guaranteed.  There are quite a few ingredients but it just tastes like chocolate.  Though not thick and creamy, the taste is purely, deliciously chocolatey.  The butterscotch shake is also decadent and amazing.  Their Italian hot chocolate is super rich and thick.  We love all the desserts that feature dark chocolate.\n\nThe atmosphere is very classy and make you expect great things to come out of the kitchen for you.  For the most part, they deliver.  The serving presentation is really fancy.  So many special little platters, jars, dishes, serving trays, \""potion\"" bottles.\n\nWe've found that many dishes are hard to picture based on the descriptions on the menu (chocolate with chocolate and a side of chocolate).  The servers are very helpful in making suggestions and describing what everything looks/tastes like.\n\nWe much prefer this place over Sugar Factory and Jean Philppe (sp?).",1.0,0.993959665298462

I have never eaten here however I have been here many times in the winter months for the sipping chocolate (please DO NOT mistake for hot chocolate) After my boyfriend being to Spain he told me about this kind of drink this is not quite the same but as close as he has found here in the US.  If you're wondering what it's like in Spain it is like a chocolate bar melted with a crispy sweet bread if you put it in it would stand on end.  This is ever so slightly more liquid but OMG good!  Pretty much a milk chocolate, if that is you choice bar melted down with milk added and put in a cup warm.\n\nYou don't need much at all.  The way it used to work was they had a little kioskey thing out front to just order and go.  They must have wanted to up the value of the property so that is now gone for tables for dinner.  You now have to go into the bar and order, this wouldn't be a bad thing but the bartenders are truly unpleasant.  I mean if you hate your job that much and you pouring a cup of chocolate into a cup for me and getting a tip for your unpleasantries and inconvenience is such a problem then please find a new job!  I hate the new layout and consider not ever coming back but sadly I like chocolate and I like it a lot in small portions so I will come back.\n\nAgain this review is not for food it is for sipping chocolate and sipping chocolate service.  If you do go in get the sipping chocolate not hot chocolate it is a thicker more amazing version if you get hot chocolate it is just that and at this place it is over priced and not that great!  If you go with my recommendation it is a pay per oz kinda thing.  You do NOT need a full 6oz cup please learn from my mistakes of the past 3oz is great sometimes 1oz is fine but just not quite enough.\n\nIf it wasn't for the crapy, crabby service this would have been 5 stars for the chocolate  by the way this is not the first time to go into the bar and get crabby service, they really need to retrain and rehire the bar staff...",0.0,0.996531069278717

Who needs a savory meal when you can have chocolate for lunch/ dinner?  My favorites are:\n\nHazelnut Cream Banana Toffee Crepe:\nA nice crepe filled with chocolate hazelnut and sliced bananas.  In a small beaker, chocolate sauce to pour all over the crepe.  Caramel ice cream. Chocolate wafer balls.  5/5\n\nBanana Split Waffles:\nCrunchy waffles with banana halves topped with vanilla ice cream. A beaker of chocolate sauce and some chocolate wafer balls. 5/5\n\nChocolate Chunks Pizza:\nA pizza with melted chocolate on top then 2 toppings you want: peanut butter, hazelnut, marshmallows and bananas.  Or you can get The Works to get all toppings.  I personally like hazelnut and banana.  5/5\n\nFondue:\nYou have 4 options:  tempura, sugar churros, classic European and S'mores.  Of these, I like the classic European because you have a wider variety of goodies you can dip into chocolate such as cookies, marshmallows, sponge cake, strawberries and bananas. 5/5\n\nIf chocolate is my drug, Max Brenner is my dealer.",0.0,0.972887635231018

So given that, the fact that I was still blown away by the offerings here - says everything.\n\nOn our final night in Vegas, my guy and I ventured in for a late-night dinner and drinks. Located conveniently inside Caesar's Palace (we stayed at Nobu Hotel), this was stumbling distance back to our suite - perfect.\n\nWe started with a pair of the signature chocolate martinis. Picture the most perfect milk chocolate ganache, a hefty swig of premium vodka, and a dusting of chocolate powder...all perfectly poured into a sizable martini glass and topped with a ripe, chocolate-dipped strawberry skewer. Pure bliss, I tell you. The smoothness of all ingredients mingled together perfectly. We hardly needed dinner after these babies!\n\nDinner, however, also did not disappoint. A bacon burger for him, a grilled chicken panini for me - and we were set! The accompanying waffle-cut fries were a great touch. We were officially stuffed and ready to roll out (literally).\n\nBut then I saw it: A marshmallow-topped, white chocolate ganache white russian. Yes, I had to have it. It came out with a side of liquid white chocolate ganache which we drizzled into the perfect cocktail to our heart's content. (This drink was also amazing.) \n\nKey takeaways: Go here for a chocolate martini, even if you aren't a dessert person or a chocolate lover! Stay for some food (you'll need it), then split another beverage or two. If you're a fan of White Russians, do not pass up the opportunity to get one here. \n\nRegardless of what you choose, you will want to try everything on the menu!

We're talking Artisan chocolate here.\n\nThe one noticeable difference for this store is, attached to the message on the windows of \""Coffee vs Chocolate\"", they have a small caf\u00e9 space up the back where you can order tea, coffee, hot chocolate and 'chocolate-coffee'. What, you might ask, is that? You can have a latte, capucino or americano made with ground cocoa beans rather than coffee beans. It isn't sweet, it's not chocolate as we know it to eat, and you can add your own sugar, but it's a different way of drinking chocolate. I didn't try one myself,yet, but I am very intrigued!

We went right for the truffels, even though they were on the pricier side. A box of assorted truffels came to $25 CAN, but what's a weekend getaway without splurging on some sweets?! The chocolates themselves were delicious and so\n nicely packaged that we didn't want to open the box. Overall we had a lovely experience at Suite 88.",1.0,0.9998137354850768

While I like all chocolate, I'm typically more drawn to milk chocolate and if you add anything caramel, marshmallow or peanut butter then I'm really sold. He directed me to the milk chocolate with caramel inside. One bite and I was in chocolate heaven. The caramel was sweetly delicious and I knew I must have more. I ended up buying two more of the chocolate caramel and two chocolate cream which I was told is like a combination of whip cream and brandy. I'm sold. I will be visiting often and can't wait to try their hot chocolate and coffee. They also had some amazing looking croissants and adorable chocolate gnomes, pumpkins for Thanksgiving and will be getting Yule logs soon. I immediately envisioned serving ice cream sundaes inside the hollow chocolate fixtures. \n\nMy advice to you is to pay this new chocolatier a visit and nip your chocolate cravings.

You can tell that the owner really cares for the business that she has created. She is passionate about the work she does and wants people to understand the art of crafting a great piece of chocolate.\n\nWe tried many samples including sea salt truffle, raspberry, mint, white chocolate with raspberries. However my favorite was milk chocolate covered almonds with powdered sugar.  \n\nThis is an excellent place to stop by in the contained park, especially if you are on a date.

The sea bass was okay with a nice crisp on the skin but expected more flavor and a thicker cut ( I had better at a small hole in the wall in San Clemente, CA); the asparagus was too al dente and drenched in way too much butter for my liking (and I love butter); the mushroom side was sad and I haven't had a mushroom dish I never liked until now.\n\nThat being said, I did appreciate our attentive server and the experience of fine dining.

They always have a featured chocolate bar with samples - the first time, it was the Barcelona bar (almonds and grey sea salt) and the second, it was Mo's Bacon Bar, the aforementioned treat.

Nom!!!!\n\nTheir Cocoa-coffee shop at the back is inspired - loved my wee machiato.\n\nVery much looking fwd to cooking with the cocoa meat rub. This place is a palace of chocolate and a must visit for anyone!!! :o)",1.0,0.9983787536621094

Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence.  Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic.  They even have samples of their chocolate out to try!  Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality!  The shop inside is cute and modern.  \n\nMilkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!!  The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors.  Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors).  At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces.  Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically.  It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip.  She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :)  \n\nIT WAS HEAVEN.  I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip.  All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness.\n\nGo here.  You will be addicted.",1.0,0.9983993172645568

Yes, that right better that Swiss, German and even my favorite English, but that's only because I'm British and grew up on the stuff. That said, any serious European will tell you that Belgium chocolate is the best and what you buy for that special person in your life whether it's your spouse, mother, grandmother and/or any man or woman that you need to impress.\n\nHeads up, they currently offer a 5 percent discount off your next purchase with your receipt. Also you can have dinner at 5th and Wine around the corner as their chocolate is on the dessert menu. I recommend eating fast, because you are going to want to get more chocolate before you head home.",1.0,0.9995243549346924
