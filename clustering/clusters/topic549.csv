Good selection of sandwiches/salads/soups, reasonable prices, plenty of tables, and a nice atmosphere. It feels more grown up than most of your other lunch options, but the food is ready super fast.

I always get the Mongolian Beef and for the price structure, it is by far the best out here in Vegas.  Good portions of beef, with a starter of choice of soup: corn or hot n sour (honestly I don't like either so I pass) and choice of spring roll or salad (both are good).\nI always add the cheese wontons (6 for $4.95).  Unfortunately/fortunately, however you want to look at it, this is an \""authentic\"" employer...so I wouldn't recommend asking for things off the menu.  I asked for crab rangoons and was starred at with a blank look...repeated several times, then when I thought about it a little more and asked for cheese wontons I was met with \""ok cheese wonton\"".  it's not on the menu I just always enjoy these.  no added frills to them though from here, just cream cheese in the wonton.  \nAnywhoo, good place for a good cheap lunch that you will walk out of with a full belly.",1.0,0.7202672362327576

The restaurant is a bit off the beaten path, but relatively easy to find with Waze or any other GPS app.\n\nOn my last visit I tried the BBQ chicken wrap and was impressed with the fresh delicious ingredients they used.  The wrap was also stuffed to gills with chicken.  I hate places that make their sandwiches look big, only to take a bite and find them filled with too much lettuce or other fillers.\n\nThe restaurant has some nice outdoor seating for when the temps are comfortable.  If it's too toasty outside though, they have plenty of tables inside along with a large screen TV to watch.
