I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. \n\nFast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First, I met a co-worker for a quick lunch, which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing, so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt, I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird, greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse, after my first taste, I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken, thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. \n\nNonetheless, I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.  \n\nI really try to give places more than one try before writing a bad review but you couldn't pay me to go back for another try",0.0,0.9725691080093384

We wanted to just stay on the resort our first night and wanted a low key and less expensive casual dinner.  Dining at this restaurant was fairly low key, not loud and crazy and if you like people watiching you can sit in their terrace seating which is out on the Mandalay Bay thoroughfare.  Here are my thoughts:\n\nAtmosphere - B\nNot swank but better than most chain restaurants.  Fairly intimate seating allowed us to focus on ourselves and not all of the patrons.\n\nService - C\nThe server was attentive enough but honestly was acting in his attitude and demeanor that being there was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  No smile, no personality, but he was on top of things however he probably could have chilled out on the upselling a bit.\n\nFood - C\nWe each had burgers, I had the swiss & onion (swiss cheese/grilled onions) and wifey had the shrooms & blue (mushrooms/bleu cheese)...I will say this the burgers were better than most burgers you would get at a chain restaurant, they claim that they use grain fed, no hormone, angus beef and I believe them.  The meat was tasty.  Burger came with fries that were very ordinary and probably a little stale, that was dissapointing. Overall slightly less than what I would expect for a $17 burger even if in Vegas.\n\nFor desert we got the krispy kreme doughnut sundae and it was the low light of the meal, I do not recommend it.  A super stale krispy kreme doughnut smothered in cheap soft serve with gobs of whip cream and some tasteless sprinkes.  Cheap at $6 but not worth it.\n\nDrinks were $3.50 for soda which is still a tad pricey flat soda.\n\nI would only eat here again if it were comped or if I was in a hurry because they did get us in and out of there in less than an hour.",0.0,0.9800047278404236
