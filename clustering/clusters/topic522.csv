This place was... all right. The staff weren't especially friendly and it felt as though they wanted us out of there as soon as my husband and I finished our food. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered one of their combo plates and it was good! Not the best Mexican I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The beans were great, and it's hard to get me to like fried beans. Definitely the best part of the meal! The rice was meh and the chicken tacos were okay. \n\nNot a big fan of the atmosphere, though. It looked fairly dirty, I was half-expecting a roach to come crawling across the floor. And I think the place would look much better if they had real matching chairs, instead of assorted lawn chairs.\n\nProbably won't come back here unless we have some sort of coupon, Groupon or otherwise.",1.0,0.9829732179641724

It's on Las Vegas Boulevard, about 4 or 5 miles south of Mandalay Bay, in the same mega-shopping complex as a woefully outdated outlet mall.\n\nThe reason to come to BWW is (of course) the chicken wings.  I almost always get the boneless teriyaki, but you can get traditional wings too in more than a dozen different types of sauces, ranging from mild to dangerous.  BWW is more than just wings.  It has an unbelievable menu.  You can get a typical burger, pulled pork or grilled chicken sandwich.  There's also an awesome selection of appetizers.  Cheeseburger dippers, mini quesadillas, and my personal favorite mini corn dogs (with honey bbq sauce) are just some of the highlights.  Maybe my only gripe is that BWW does not serve traditional fries.  The only option are these things called Buffalo Chips, which are round fries about the size of nickels.  And of course, there's a good selection of beer.\n\nBWW is the ultimate place to get together with friends, watch the game and gorge yourself on food.  This location in particular has tv's everywhere, ranging from massive to small, many of them high-def.  To top it off it has the trivia game to pass the time between games and waiting for your food.  The restaurant is split up, with the main dining area in front.  A huge wall separates it from the bar area in the back, where people can smoke.  I can't recommend BWW strong enough to have a good time.  The location near the Galleria Mall in Henderson is also very fun.",1.0,0.9927807450294496
