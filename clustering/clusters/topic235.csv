They sell some lovely pendant necklaces with beautiful gems inside which are priced at about \u00a3150, but they are truly gorgeous. I came here several weeks ago looking to buy a charm bracelet, as I thought with the number of charms which they sell that they must have a decent selection of charm bracelets. How wrong I was. They sold several bracelets with lots and lots of loops, which made the bracelet look elasticated, but there were no silver link bracelets to add charms too, I was pretty disappointed. \n\nMost of the jewellery in this is store is priced at under \u00a350 so it is good place to go to buy a gift for someone, but the quality of the goods didn't look the best.

Seriously, it seemed like every time I complemented somebody on their jewelry earlier this year they would tell me they got it from Versona. With this in mind, I was excited to check it out.\n\nFirst of all, the selection is incredible. It's pretty much a massive boutique of jewelry. Everything seems to be roughly organized on tables by color. Many of the pieces either come in sets or have supplement pieces that match with them. I didn't see any broken pieces just laying out and I've never heard any of my friends whine about the jewelry being cheaply made. Prices are pretty decent. Few, if any, jewelry pieces are over $20.00. The sale section is massive and about half the original price. I've had great luck finding what I'm looking for in the sale section. As far as jewelry goes, you're definitely going to find something that you like when you come in here. It's pretty much impossible not to.\n\nIn addition to jewelry, Versona carries other accessories such as clutches, scarves, hair bows, and shoes. They also sell clothes. I found a rather crappy laptop case for 5 bucks. It fell apart within a week but I wasn't that upset because I had gotten it on clearance. I bought a clearance scarf here last week for $7.00 and it seems to be made pretty well. My friend is a ballroom dancer and she finds almost all of her accessories here. She cannot rave enough about how awesome and affordable the hair accessories are. I've found the shoes at Versona, though cheap, to be really uncomfortable an cheaply made. The clothes at Versona are stylish, but definitely overpriced. I saw maxi dresses and shirts that I could easily find at a regular department store for half the price. \n\nOverall, Versona's selection cannot be beat.

The employees who work on the floor are fairly young and a little apathetic, but since it's all arranged by color, you don't really need a lot of help.\n\nAlthough it has clothes, I mainly think of Versona as a jewelry/accessories store, and I don't think I've bought a necklace that cost more than $14.

They even offer local artist/designer and namesake GabyOlivia brand jewelry. Things I could definitely see being worn to a club. Classy.\n\nThe prices are a bit much for accessories. Around $16-30+. Most necklaces were $16-23ish and the simple, elegant bracelets were $16ish. Great pieces that you won't find in a lot of places in Vegas though.
