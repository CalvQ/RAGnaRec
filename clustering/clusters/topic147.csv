Ok, just for fun, give me a sample of the nearly black super dark chocolate. After looking at this flavor, I figured trying it would be akin to those 90% chocolate bars at Whole Foods. Or maybe like those lemony tasting ants in Australia. You just have to do it. Once. To say you did it.\n\nI have never had anything more chocolaty. It was like brownie batter but darker and better- and without those obnoxious flour clumps. My mind was officially changed- it would be the super dark chocolate with the panna cotta. Pairing the PMS-licious chocolate with the more mild Italian custard flavor was a good plan. I never would have finished the chocolate alone.\n\nSemi-long story a little less long, I liked the place.

Yes, I saw that movie and you should too!\n\nMy friends and I came here for a late lunch after checking into our hotel. Since it was already 4pm and we had dinner reservations at 7:30pm we decided to order a few appetizers to share. Luckily we did to because the prices were ridiculous! I mean, $15.50 for grilled cheese? C'mon! \n\nAnyways.. back to the food. We ordered the tower of onion rings, buffalo wings, ahi tuna salad, and two frozen hot chocolate (for two) to share between the five of us. I loved the ahi tuna salad, the sauce was so good. The onions rings were cooked perfectly and didn't have all that oil and grease that you find at most places. I didn't have any of the buffalo wings because I have braces and didn't want to stain my clear bands (yes, I have braces, who hasn't?). The frozen hot chocolate was nice and cold and refreshing in the 100+ degree weather. I was a little disappointed though. I think all the hype made me expect it to be better but it was just okay for me. I was going to buy a mix of it to take home but after trying I passed. I'll drink it again if I come back here for another meal but I wouldn't buy some to take home.\n\nOverall, I liked the food here. It's definitely pricey for what it is, but they do have large portions. If you're willing to spend the money for the experience then definitely try this place. If you're not the type to spend a lot of money on food then by all means skip. But you'll be sorry you missed the experience!",1.0,0.9857818484306335

It was actually as long as their famous hot dog...I can't believe it was at least a foot long. You should also see the sausages that came with it. I don't know how they got it so big. It was a little scary eating it at first. Their famous frozen hot chocolate was nothing but cold chocolate. I didn't think anything was spectacular about it. However I did like their food. Their chicken salad, their cheeseburger, their French toast log, was all great. I wouldn't wait in line just to eat here though. The only reason why we came here was because my cousin went crazy at the though of frozen hot chocolate, boy was we disappointed that it is nothing more than what it is.

My friend said to try the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE and it was out of this world!  It's made from 20 different types of chocolate and comes with whipped cream. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The waitress said that they want people to order it first so that they can enjoy it fully on an empty stomach and it can also be your drink to compliment your meal. You have a choice of a single or cup that serves two. It costs $10 for the single and $14 for the double.  The single cup was huge for one person but soo good I wouldnt recommend sharing! lol\n\nI had the HANGOVER OMELET which was decent but the upside is that it's the hugest OMELET EVER! It had bacon, fries, cheese and the waitress told me they use a total of 8 eggs for each omelet! TALK ABOUT FATTY! It also came with a choice of steak or sweet potatoe fries.  WAY TOO MUCH CARBS especially with fries already in the omelet. The price was a little high for an omelet but you definately get the biggest portion I've ever seen. IT WAS HUGE TWSS!\n\nMy uncle got their hot chocolate mocha cappicino which came in a huge coffee cup. The waitress was really nice, she forgot about it and didnt charge us once we reminded her.\n\nThe downs of this place is that in the winter it's way too cold to eat outside even with their heaters (which are super weak by the way).  If you're there when its cold, wait a few minutes and be seated inside.  Although the patio area over looks las vegas BLVD and had a great ambiance!  The prices are a little too much for the meals they offer and theyre not the best.  I give the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE 5 stars though!\n\nThey also accept the TOTAL REWARDS PLAYER CARD so I was able to get most of my meal comp'd through the players card!\n\nI will definately come back to try out more desserts in the future and get the Frozen Hot Chocolate again!",0.0,0.9899449944496156

Told her I tried the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. She got all excited and told me she had tried it too but at Dunkin Doughnuts. We both agreed that it was good but really rich. Then I said \""I didn't feel it was worth the 10.00. I think she felt bad telling me that she had only paid... get this... 2.00 for hers! Trying to make me feel better, she insisted that mine was probably better to which I replied \""Nope, I am pretty sure they were the same.\"" Haha, so there you have it, even though I have not tried the one from Dunkin Doughnuts, I would say to try theirs if you really feel you must try \""frozen hot chocolate\"" aka \""The more chocolaty milkshake.\"" No milkshake is ever worth 10.00!!!

Flavors like 'peanut butter, mint or vanilla'.  No hint of fancy chocolate like Lindt or Ghirardelli flakes that might make the price worth it.  I bought anyway, the mochachino flavor, I wanted peanut butter but they were out and $12.97 later, ($1 for a plastic glass of tap water) I stood by the window and waited for my frozen hot chocolate.  They are fast, I will give them that, but what passed from the window into my hand was basically a grande frappucino at three times the price.  I'm not sure what others were raving about because nothing in that glass could come close to being worth the $11 price tag for the drink.  \n\nAs my friend and I wondered exactly why there are so many people at Serendipity we could only guess that 1 -they'd never been there before or 2- like me they couldn't remember having it the first time.  Apparently, if you actually sit down in the restaurant, the frozen hot chocolate is much larger which might have made me feel a tiny bit better.  However, either way, the melted milkshake with a load of whipped cream that is the frozen hot chocolate is not worth your time or money.  Go somewhere else.

Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.\n\nThey top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.\n\nService was quick on my one visit.\n\nPrices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.\n\nSerendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.\n\nNow that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).\n\nSerendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.

I ordered my frozen hot chocolate, listened to a little One Direction over the loudspeaker, and waited for my drink.\n\nMy frozen hot chocolate was disappointing. It tasted like chocolate powder, and not in a good way. It was something that I felt like I could definitely make for myself, and for much, much cheaper.

Also, service is not bad, especially comparing it to its New York location which had terrible service!!

Warning though, they will only hold your table for 5 minutes. This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that.

I stopped by once for breakfast after the event and all my friends agreed that it was pretty mediocre for the price, nothing special. \nOverall, I've always heard great things about Serendipity's infamous Frozen Hot Choco and I have to confirm that it's a must try (especially during the summer)!!",1.0,0.9464104175567628
