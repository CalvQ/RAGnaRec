This is technically my second time going to this event... the first time, I was with my girlfriend at the time. Neither of us could handle being there for more than a few minutes, so we got our entry fee refunded and ate at a Mexican food place nearby (which was pretty disgusting if I remember correctly).\n\nThis year, I was determined to check it out. I went with a few friends, and we wisely decided to get drunk before going. \n\nThe Scottsdale Culinary Festival is a misnomer... it's neither culinary, nor a festival. At least it's actually in Scottsdale. It's more like a parade of drunk douchebags. My friend spent the day giddily taking pictures of d-bag shirts and dumb hairstyles. It's very different seeing them outside of the clubs. \n\nThe food here was a joke... mostly chain restaurants. There wasn't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food. This city has some amazing unique restaurants, and it seemed like the sampling at the event wasn't representational of the kinds of fantastic \""culinary\"" experiences one can have here.\n\nThere's nothing really festival about this either. It's definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, \""beer gardens,\"" and wrist bands - it's just some boring food and drink. \n\nMy biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there. \n\nThe vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I'm sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It's a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren't even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this).\n\nOverall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun. It was interesting people-watching, but beyond that there wasn't any reason to come. If I had to do this totally sober, I would've been miserable.\n\nEdit: After browsing the other reviews, it seems like I didn't completely understand the event. I wasn't aware proceeds went to charities, and I didn't see a lot of the restaurants other people listed. I guess at an event like this, everyone is going to have a different experience.",0.0,0.9990921020507812

We have been to the GAP the last 2 years - for those that don't know this goes on the last 2 days and you are able to eat and drink all day from different vendors.  I'm not sure what happened this year. \n\nWe pre-purchased our tickets this year for general admission and for the beer garden - I love craft beer - in order to save a little money.  We showed up as usual ready to spend some money (it does get pricey) and sample some great food.  There were maybe half the usual number of vendors there this year.  The same went for the beer garden.  \n\nWe still had a good time and sampled some good food.  There are usually decent bands to listen to also.  I will definitely double check the vendor list next year before we head up there.

I want to key in on the word \""Picnic\"".   A lot of reviewers have complained about the food not be of culinary excellence, which is correct, but the selections are decent for a picnic.  There is broad range of mediocre, decent priced food from local restaurants, such as BBQ, taco stands, gelato, sushi, and even Indian Food.  Despite what some of the reviewer's state, there are several events throughout the week that are tailored towards the Foodies.   These events do cost more than $10 for admission, as do most extraordinary culinary events.   Now back to the picnic, it's a blast!  It's a perfect way to enjoy the spring while day drinking.   This year, they went away with tickets and instead you put money on the GAP card, and pay vendors with the card.   I believe the reason there is a no cash policy, is because a portion of the proceeds go to non-profit organizations. We spent a good amount of time in the beer garden.  On Sunday the price of admission into the garden was cut down to $10, and then each beer sample (4oz) is $1.  With a selection of over 200 beers, it was a great way to try all different kinds of beer from local breweries and vendors.  The rest of our day was spent lounging on the main picnic lawn enjoying the bands playing on the main stage.  To sum it up: Go to the AZ picnic if you want to hang out in the sun and enjoy some tasty beverages and mediocre food... Don't go to the picnic if you have less than $40 in your pocket, and expect to be delivered a culinary masterpiece.",1.0,0.9630983471870422

I like it. Not an \""I Like It and I Want To Go Every Year\"" kind of like, but more of an \""I Like It and Would Go Every Other Year\"" kind of like. It is great for people watching so you really don't have to spend a ton of money to have a good time. It's $10 to get in and if you don't get wasted or pig out then you can get by with spending only $20 inside. Yes, almost all of the vendors are over priced and the food can be rather pedestrian (too many chain restaurants for my liking), but you can find a few tent gems that are offering good food at a reasonable price. Yesterday I got a big $6 BBQ plate, $2 for two tacos, a big order of stromboli for $5, $2 mac n' cheese, and a $6 16oz. Coors Light.  Don't worry, I spread that out over about 6 hours (with a midday break at Patties for a few beers).\n\nOne big improvement this year is doing away with the tickets and switching over to a debit card for all of your food and drink purchases. Much easier. One bummer, it is the same tents year after year. It makes it kinda boring.\n\nTips on making it better:\nWhy not have a section for new restaurants at the Culinary Festival? Like a whole stretch of tents for all the first time restaurants appearing at the GAP. I don't know, I think this is a great idea if I may say so. And I know this sounds lame, but some of the prices at these tents are ridiculously high. Why set your prices so high at an event like this when you can possibly attract new customers to your actual restaurant. Seems like a bad business decision to me.  \n\nIt will always crack me up when I see girls dressed in club attire and six inch high heels for this event. Why?!? You are walking around a food festival and there is no way you are comfortable in that shit! Hysterical. Please don't change, Scottsdale!",0.0,0.994705855846405

Even if I was required to be at this event, I would probably try to skip out.  As others have mentioned, lots of costs for everything, and many they don't tell you up front.  First there's the entrance fee, then there's another fee to get into the alcohol areas, then they make you put money on an event debit card that you have to use throughout the event for tastings/samples.  So not only are you paying to get into the overall event, you are paying anywhere from $2-$6 for every one of your food samples (which are bite-sized, at best), and $1-$4 for a 4-oz beer or taste of hard alcohol, on top of whatever they charged you to enter the alcohol area.  Before you even get to try anything you've easily spent $40 per person.\n\nAll the while, it's sweltering hot because 3/4 of the event is on pavement/blacktop, and don't even bother trying to find water.  The lines are so long and water stations so few, I'd suggest smuggling your own in if you really must go to this event.  To add insult to injury, most of the food is from your run of the mill downtown Scottsdale bars.  Salty Se\u00f1orita?  Grimaldi's?  Pita Jungle?  C'mon, those aren't culinary fest-worthy restaurants.  Not to rip on them or anything, but there are far fewer foodie delights than deserve to be at an event that touts itself as a culinary festival.  \n\nThe one star goes to the people-watching, as everyone else has mentioned.  Plastic, decorated women teetering around in 6-inch heels and the miniest of miniskirts/dresses with cleavage popping in every direction while men in expensive golfing outfits and italian leather shoes act like they're on a casual outing...definitely a sight to behold.  \n\nIf you must go, trick someone else into paying, or volunteer so you can at least get in for free.",0.0,0.9950706958770752

It was also a younger crowd but only an area blocked off with nothing special inside.  The beer choices are horrible (no imports), and were each $6.  The food, for the most part disgusting and expensive.  Dickey's BBQ was very good though the line was very long do to it being the best and they were very slow and confused.

There is at least one or two local bands going at any given moment, plenty of art galleries showing something new and cool little restaurants and pubs all around the area.\nThe only real issue is parking, but if you don't mind walking a bit, that isn't much of an issue either.",1.0,0.99916672706604

You get more bang for your buck that way.\n\nConsidering the type of event First Friday is, you'll find all sorts of people dressed in eccentric fashion.

We parked our chairs on the island at the Class IV turn to watch the rafters and were not disappointed. A bunch of guides who were off the clock entertained an appreciative audience with their surfing. There were many collisions and several rafts dumptrucked to the delight of spectators. When darkness arrived we simply moved our chairs about 50 feet to the other side of the island to view the fireworks show. This was the best view we've had of fireworks in years. The show lasted 15 minutes and occurred directly overhead. They don't lie when they say there is not a bad seat in the house. I was impressed by how well USNWC staff had prepared for and handled the crowds, parking and traffic. Despite the location, it only took us about 15 minutes to get back to I-85 after the fireworks ended. There was a bottleneck on the trail back to the field where we pared, but that was kind of a fun adventure and they had thought to light the path. I imagined I was trekking through the jungle. \n\nPRAISE: This remains one of the most outstanding venues for young families. Lots space for kids to run around and dogs are welcome. \n\nCRITICISM: They need to bring in some portajohns for the women during these big events and they need to turn off the street lights around the island so campers can enjoy the night sky. \n\nTIP: If you don't want to deal with the traffic park as far away as possible in one of the upper fields and walk in. You can also avoid the traffic by staying late or leaving a cooler of beverages in your car for a tail gate party while the traffic clears. \n\nSUGGESTION: I'd highly recommend USNWC host a playboat/freestyle event here to introduce local kids and the community to what would undoubtedly be a great spectators event.",1.0,0.9987885355949402

But I was kind of disappointed with it this year mostly for the reasons Jeff S and Demetria stated. I think it should be more of a focus on locally owned restaurants as opposed to chain ones and it just seemed lame last year compared to last. Plus, you would think it would draw in more of a crowd but there wasn't alot of people there. If they wanna play with the big cities, they definitely need to expand it whether it be more entertainment, vendors and more space. One street isn't gonna cut it. You're crammed in with people near cookers and it feels like hell. I don't like sweating while eating but that's something you have to deal with Taste of Charlotte. They definitely need to open up another street and ban those damn strollers. The coins are a decent deal but if you're expecting to get full, eat ahead of time or after if you want to keep yourself somewhat on a budget. Thanks to fabulous Yelp, I got to try chicken satay, bbq slider, a mini cupcake and a water since i was ill prepared with my water situation. The coins are weird, some places give you a good apoint of grub for 3, not enough for 2 and sometimes a good portion for 1.

Coins are an interesting concept until you realize just how much you are paying for the food*.  $4.29 for a tiny pork slider?  $5.71 for an alcoholic drink?  A bit much under most circumstances.  There are a couple of bargains - the mini taco salad was a decent size for the price (just one coin) comes to mind.  The free samples were decent, but few and far between.\n\nWhile I agree that there are mostly chains here, your average mom and pop is just unable to set up for such a huge turnout.  At the same time, your larger providers (chains) should be able to cut their price a bit and make it up on quantity.  I am sure there are all sorts of costs involved, and I have no doubt that it is a pain - but even at noon on Friday the place was packed.  Drop many items to a single coin or two and there would be even more people there - allowing everyone to easily make it up on larger volume.\n\nThe food itself was tasty, if a bit bland.  Out of the thirty or so vendors, about half had to have pulled pork.  I get where we are, and I love pulled pork, but really?  Surely there should be some vetting and at some point someone needs to say there was just a bit too much pulled pork on the street.\n\nBeyond that, having the event Uptown is cool, but trying to squeeze so many into such a small space along with booths just is not all that practical.  Plus it cuts off the streets.  Maybe throw it down in Marshall park where everyone can spread out and get a little elbow room.\n\n*Prices may vary slightly depending on just how much you paid for your coins - these are based on 7 coins for $10, in case you want to figure it out for yourself.",0.0,0.9964221715927124

Make note that 21 out of 33 restaurants represented at the Taste this year are LOCAL to CHARLOTTE.

Do I blame the festival for large crowds and hot weather? No. That's irresponsible. \n\nA few of my favorites at the Taste this year were the following: Tuxedo cupcake AND the sweet potato chips and hummus at Polka Dot Bake Shop, brisket slider at Outlaw BBQ, pretty much all three dishes from Woodlands, pork sliders from Harvest Moon Grille and a mini Italian beef from Matt's Chicago Dog.

No outside food or coolers allowed. \n\nWhere else can you sample food from so many different restaurants at one time? It's like a super food court outside (but way better! most food courts don't impress me anymore, except Hawaii's Ala Moana) with live music (MIx 94.1 FM artists) and events scheduled- except the prices range from $1-$5 for smaller portions. One year, I got a humongous slice of Key Lime Pie for $1.00. The weather is just right at this time of year. The park, located on the west side, is such a nice one, that you can enjoy the grounds. It's a nice family thing to do. And the food choices are amazing. Make your rounds before deciding on what you really want or you'll be sorry.\n\nWe used to go to the San Gennaro Italian Festival but it's gotten pretty pricey for food and admission, that the whole thing cost us about $50 and this was a five years ago.

The parking isn't all that bad if you arrive early-ish in the day (like in the first 3-4 hours!), and from parking to festival entrance we're talking 10 mintues. Not a big deal.

It's not gourmet, but it does the trick. My main issue is most of the food is sizeable portions for like $5. Ok, it's called BITE of Las Vegas, I'd like to try lots of mini portions for $1-$3. Some places get the concept, but most didn't. At Taste of Chicago, for instance, each booth has to do a mini portion for like $1 or $2. I wish they'd kind of mandate that each place did one \""BITE\"" portion for a small price, then sell freaking meal sized portions for those that want it. My husband and I usually split 3-4 $5 items before passing out into a food coma - I usually end up wishing my stomach and wallet had room to try more of the appealing items offered, but they are too damn big. \n\nMy other minor complaint is I wish there were more seating. It gets fairly crowded under the few tents they have with chairs. I guess I could plan ahead and pack a blanket or something?

It's your typical vendor trucks making mass amounts of food and a lot of it sitting around waiting to be purchased. This would explain why some if the ribs/meats we tried were dry and tasteless. A seafood vendor \""Lobster Muddah\""(?) was actually very good. Depending on who you took a gamble on, the food was good or bad. Pizzas were doughy, some meatballs were loaded with bread crumbs. Prices for food were ridiculous. You would have thought you were in a proper restaurant. The covered seating area was adequate during the day but once it got busier in the evening you had to be aggressive to find a place to sit. Entertainment on Saturday was the highlight for us. The Las Vegas Bee Gees played at 5pm and were great. Unfortunately the organizers didn't have a schedule for entertainment at the venue or website, so you were on your own to figure it out. The carnival rides were your typical roadshow of rides and games. Once the sun started going down things got interesting. People were obviously dumping their kids without supervision at the event.

Just call it what it is a fair/carnival with some food vendors stop trying to make it sound like more than what it really is. As most have said they are getting pretty ridiculous with the prices. Just for two people your looking at 50 bucks minimum between the $9 entrance fee each(ridiculous) and a small snack (not even the full meals). Also please stop with the animals it's borderline cruelty. Especially the part where kids ride the ponies. Literally chained to something that walks around in a 3 ft circle where I have personally witnessed the handlers getting rough with them when they try to stop or don't move fast. Some positives were the beefed up security after the punk kids caused all the problems last time around.

It doesn't have the same ride carnival atmosphere as San Gennaro, but I'm fine with that. I'm here for the food anyway. On that front, the GFF provides a good selection. I ended up having:\n\n* Dolmathes Plate. Beef and rice rolled up in grape leaves. I could eat these all day.\n* Spanakopitas. Filo dough stuffed with various ingredients.\n* Ouzorita. Margarita made with Ouzo for that Greek twist. It was OK.\n* Pistachio-topped Baklava. Delicious as expected.\n* Bogatsa. Custard and cheese within layers of filo dough. Yummy without being too sweet (in contrast to Baklava).\n\nLogistically, the festival is well run. Most people will park on the street, but fortunately the organizers have provided convenient shuttle buses that will take you from farther parking areas to the church. I like that the festival is hosted by the St. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church. It really gives it that local community vibe.

I thoroughly enjoyed the many performances by widely diverse dancers - toddlers to adults, people large and small, a rainbow of hues- just beautiful.

Warning alot of the price were high and required cash. My fav was Otai, its a hawaiian drink that is very sweet, refreshing, and hydrating. My drink kept me cool as we looked at all the vendors selling things that that they made. Live music was going on to keep everyone in the theme of Hawaii. Many of the live acts where actually poplar singers in Hawaii. Went on Easter and they had a free easter egg hunt for the kiddos. I took away a star because I was they had Lei Aloha dancers.

Julia pretty much touched on everything, but here's my take.  I had not been to the previous uptown location, but I do know that the Wells Fargo Atrium space would be more conducive to this type of event.  \n\nFirst, we entered from behind the mammoth school/church from Elm Lane, saw no signs, drove around the building only to see people walking to an entrance near where we initially drove in.  There were no signs in the parking lots stating where the festival itself was located and this campus is fairly large with several buildings.  We saw one little sign outside an entrance that pointed to the festival.  We walked in, paid the $2 admission, got a bracelet and walked in.  As Julia mentioned, the first things you saw was a bunch of useless stuff trying to take your hard-earned money like they were the government. In the midst of all of this was a booth to buy the needed the tickets.  I don't like the ticket system either but I understand it.  It keeps businesses from pocketing cash.  We didn't get any tickets there but walked outside into a cramped area where there was another booth to buy tickets.  There were a couple of places here selling food.  They had a table for \""carnival food\"" and they had popcorn and one other thing :(  There was a booth selling fresh zeppolis and those looked tasty.  We got some tickets since I was going to get a slice of pizza and a drink, but the line was way too long and they had one small stand selling all of the food.  The food was also just from NY Pizza and Pasta, so it wasn't like you couldn't get it any other day besides the fact that you could get it any other day fresher and cheaper.  Add a drink cart in the corner, a dessert table, and a bunch of chairs without tables in a small room and it got cramped quickly with no comfortable place to eat.  We just got desserts which were not all that great and some coffee to use the tickets we bought.  The cannoli was decent; nothing else was.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back here, even if it was free.  The food isn't good and it's not even worth $2 to enter.  Luckily there is a much better Italian festival each May at St. Philip Neri in Fort Mill.  The pasta is better and fresher there, and they also sell homemade Italian sausages.  They even have bocce ball outside.  So if you want to go to an Italian festival in the Charlotte area, go to that one - not this one.",0.0,0.999235987663269

I am going to share with you what made my experience more enjoyable. \n\nFirst off, book your tickets in advance and pick up your tickets at Will Call at least a day before to avoid the mad rush.  Second, arrive AT LEAST an hour early day of.  We got there at least an hour before and while we were probably in the 3-400 range in line, it gave us a head start on the 2,500+ attendees.\n\nNext when the doors open, go as far back as you can to hit all the other booths.  Every novice is going to be taken back in amazement by the dazzling display and will park at all of the first booths they see.  This creates a log jam and ineffectively screws up your efficiency and time.  You have 2.5 hours to hit up close to 100 fine dining establishments.  In other words, less than 2 minutes per station.  This gave us a HUGE advantage over everyone else as we navigated with ease.  \n\nGoing in a group is great because you can share samples.  I know this sounds insane but with a star studded lineup of world class fine dining, you gotta save room to sample it all.  Don't eat every slider you come across.  Take a bite - pass it to your partner and toss it.  There will be at least 10 more different sliders/burgers you'll come across.   \n\nBe strategic with your carb attacks.  I like to do a ratio of 80% Meat, 10% carbs, and 10% liquids.  And by all means.....Hydrate.....i done nearly passed out an hour into it and was having a panic attack that I wouldn't be able to make my full rotation.  Luckily I rose to the occasion.  \n\nLast advice - do not park at Caesars.  I gotta withhold where I park but park anywhere but Caesars to avoid a serious log jam arriving and departing from the event.\n\nDefinitely check out Uncork'd Grand Tasting if you are a food and/or wine snob.  I highly recommend it!",0.0,0.8804018497467041

There are hundreds of artists selling their wares, but there are also four stages packed with entertainment.  The music choices range from blue grass to hip hop, folk to rock and roll and it is almost non stop between the different stages.  \n\nA lot of the artwork is out of most people's budgets, but there is a nice mix of art that you can purchase for under $50 as well.  The range of items for sale is typical of most art festivals - paintings, photography, pottery and jewelry.  One of the more unique (and affordable) vendors was the chinese paper cutter.  For $1 per letter, he cut your name and your name in Chinese out of paper and included a mat!  It was an affordable and very unique gift.  \n\nThere is also a great variety of food.  Everything from traditional cotton candy and corn dogs to lobster burgers.  I sampled the lobster burger and it was very tasty.  Like any festival, though, the food can be pricey.  \n\nOne of the nice features of the festival is that there are several free water stations around.  the day I was there it was sunny and in the 80s, so this was a life saver.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable event.

Even to get ice cream at the Kool Twists truck was another 20 minute wait after you ordered and paid for your ice cream.  The worse one of them all was the Maine Lobster Lady.  She had the longest line by no fault of her own cause she was actually a very sweet lady.  But the price she was charging for her Lobster rolls were very overpriced for the size.

Right away I could tell I wasn't the only fan of BBQ.  Tons of people lined up for all the awesomeness.  Lots of BBQ venders lined throughout the event, so no matter where you were you could smell or stop in for some good eats.  Beer was flowing and I liked that the the selection was a local Chandler brewery of SanTan Brewing Co.  \nAlong with endless selection of venders selling food, they gave a bonus of some awesome punk bands that I remember seeing in the 90's.  Loved the nostalgia of seeing all these great performers on stage.  My only complaint was the level of sound for the music.  It needed to be a lot louder then it was.  I was near the stage and still needed it louder for an outdoor event.

This fun, family oriented event has been taking place every year in early September since 1991. Yes, there's Irish step dancing, but also other forms of dance that originated in Ireland being presented here each year by an impressive cadre of professionals from local clubs and dance schools.  Last year I really enjoyed the Irish storytellers and the traditional artisans of the Hedge School as they demonstrated their skills. You can visit with the nice folks who bring their Irish dogs...setters, wolfhounds, Irish terriers and beagles...and learn about the different breeds. They also have a cute petting zoo of sheep for the kids. There's Irish food, a Celtic marketplace, and no shortage of Guinness Stout and Harp lager, which flow freely for the entire four days. All of this is fun, but what makes this festival truly 4 star worthy for me is the music, specifically Gaelic Storm, who always put on a great show. You may not know them by name, but if you've seen the movie Titanic (who hasn't?), they were the musicians featured in the scenes that took place below deck...the fun music, as opposed to the orchestra that played for the mucky mucks upstairs. There are many other musicians and entertainers, but Gaelic Storm is the real draw for me. Advance tickets are $10, and they sell for $12 at the event, so it's a fairly inexpensive afternoon.

The Irish Festival is an extremely popular event - this year in particular it was swamped. I admit, it's a beloved tradition, but it can also be a bit of an underwhelming tradition some years. I personally know what I'm getting into every year, but I can see where first-timers would get frustrated. But still, there really is plenty to appreciate here, especially if you have a family. I love walking around with my mother every year and always look forward to the following:\n\n*Exploring the enormous Irish marketplace.\n*Saying hello to a friend who brings their gypsy caravan to the event as a nice cultural addition.\n*Trying the beers and ciders - expensive, yes, but also very, very good and worth it!\n*Seeing the animals that are brought out - an array of Irish dogs and ponies is not uncommon here, although it varies on the day, weather, etc.\n*Listening in on several workshops; there are always really wonderful musicians and storytellers here; they're wonderful additions to everything else.\n*Stopping in at the vendor booths along the paths; the Welsh cookie stand is one of my favorites!\n\nBUT, I do admit, the festival is not without flaws:\n\n-Food here is expensive and a lot of it reminds me more of American pub food than Irish food, although I admittedly can't comment on just how authentic the food actually is.\n-The marketplace, despite being an amazing place to shop, is, well, pretty Americanized. For every jeweler or wood crafter that makes their items by hand, there's two stands selling \""Kiss Me, I'm Irish\"" shirts and other things along those lines. It's kind of sad to see so many awful commercialized items mixed in amongst the handmade ones.\n-Last but not least, yes: parking is a NIGHTMARE. Be prepared to deal with it. I'm sorry. It can't be helped.\n\nWell, flaws or not, I'll keep coming back, and I do recommend that everyone visit at least one time!

Overall, this was a fun event.  The cocktails were yummy (my favorite was the lime one) and reasonably priced ($5 each), and the admission price was right (free!).  The food truck gathering was also a great idea, and I enjoyed having the opportunity to sample food from one of our local mobile vendors (the Oh My Grill Truck)--though I waited waaayyy to long for it (see my review for them).  And the live music was good--but then again, I'm biased since a friend is in the band (Good Night States).  Given the density of the crowd, the event seemed to be quite popular, and most people seemed to be having a good time.\n\nFor an event focused on the Whiskey Rebellion, I felt that it was a bit light on historical content.  As someone who knows little about the Whiskey Rebellion, I was hoping that the exhibits would be a bit more educational.  Sure, making rebellion-themed sashes, decorating lemon biscuits, and face painting is fun, but I was hoping the exhibitors and/or the proprietors of Wigle would have taught me something substantive about the Whiskey Rebellion.  Also, I was hoping there'd be tours of the distillery, since that's one of the highlights of this place. Although the casks of whiskey were visible, as was part of the distilling apparatus, nobody was around to explain the distilling process to me.  To be fair, I arrived at 7pm and spent a great deal of time waiting in line for food, so it's possible that the proprietors may have been available earlier to provide tours or more information.  Be that as it may, I felt that I missed out on this part of the experience of visiting Wigle because of this, so I'll have to return in the future to take a tour.\n\nOverall, I had a fun time and would attend this event again in the future, but I hope the historical theme could be beefed up a bit for next year.",0.0,0.9808124303817748

My biggest complaint is that it's very difficult to see why you should pay a $12 entry to get into a BBQ event where you still have to pay $5-10 for food in long lines. The GA basically gets you into a dirt lot with a lot of food vendors and a band stuck back in the corner. It's a BBQ event where my $12 GA doesn't even get me wet naps, hand sanitizer stations, a mister system (as i hear last year was super hot), or much shaded seating. Even the first aid station isn't private or shaded. \n\nThe cocktails are only $6 which is great. Thank goodness we arrived after 2:00 because I can't imagine how long the food lines must have been at noon! Much of the BBQ is overpriced. One place was charging $30 for a rack of ribs, and they had already run out of their whole menu. So it was a 30 minute wait after placing your order to get food.\n\nThe vodka tent was $20 for 10 samples. For mid-day in the heat most people should not be sampling 10 different vodkas, that is absurd. And I get it BBQ doesn't need to come with a bunch of bells and whistles. But the price tags should reflect that. For two of us, we had one cocktail each and a LIGHT sampling of food from a small handful of stands.

Stand on one line just to get tickets so you can then stand in another line to get food.

Put simply, this is quite possibly the worse festival I have ever seen.\n\nFor starters, there is little in the way of bayou. Much of the spread is simply a bunch of craft booths. Last year, it was among the park. This year, it's in Concord, and I don't expect much different. The majority of the tents were somewhat interesting, but they were more suited to Festival in the Park or Matthews Alive (and then only the amateur section) than a bayou festival. Absolutely nothing related to the theme at all.\n\nAs to the food and drink? Almost non-existent. We did not purchase tickets or wristbands or anything else in advance, since we didn't know if we could make it. Actually had hoped we would see a few vendors selling crawfish or po boys or something throughout the festival. Instead, there are coolers with drinks and a fried dough cart or two. Really?\n\nThe unlimited offering was a roped-off section at one end of the park, and the line to get in was long and the food not that interesting (from what we could see). I understand that Charlotte isn't much of a hotbed of bayou or cajun activity - but there are a couple of restaurants around that could offer a few pointers in this are. Why not have them out, let them set up a tent or two, and have some local breweries offer up some beer? Maybe see if another vendor could bring in some Abita? It wouldn't be hard to outdo this event with a little work.\n\nMaybe not with unlimited eats, but surely a reasonable price point could be found - obviously with the turnout, people here are interested in the subject. In the meantime, it's probably best to avoid it.",0.0,0.9994125366210938

One booth told me, \""We served 350 people and now we are done\"".    That is unacceptable when there are more than 1000 people there.   You read the menus and you expect to eat more of the food, not have it run out on you in a very short amount of time.   I also saw cosmopolitan staff members bringing food to people in line.

I had many a great dish off the food trucks that participated in 2012 (I also had some mediocre food, but the imagination of the inventive trucks outweighed the food that was just decent).\n\nBut the good food just won't save the fact that the Foodie Fest is asking people to pay $8 to wander around a hot parking lot to choose something to eat off of a food truck.  Not to wander around a nice green park or even a desert park--a parking lot.  So the $8 buys the right to walk around the parking lot with no central entertainment--it's not a Renaissance Fair with food or a music festival with food--it's just a parking lot with food and a carnival parked next door (maybe that's a lure if you have a lot of kids).\n\nLook I love food truck culture, but I still can't figure out why there's an admission price.  And a note to the trucks: if people are paying admission to come try out a bunch of dishes, change your menu up and offer small dishes for cheaper prices.  Most of the trucks were offering a full dish for $7-10.  Most of the time I love the larger dish, but folks came to the festival to taste as many things as possible (for $8 admission).  Trucks participating in the event might want to offer small \""tasting\"" dishes so that fest-goers can try out more trucks and more dishes.  The way it worked out this year, I split 5 dishes off of five trucks and just kept thinking \""I really paid $8 to walk around this parking lot\"".\n \nFood: great to good.  Music: meh.  Atmosphere: awful.  Admission price: ridiculous given that you're not getting anything with admission.",0.0,0.9990100860595704

They were delicious! \n\nFukuburger a normal 5 star truck disappointed us by serving our Burgers bloody and under cooked on the first night. 2nd day the Burgers were cooked to perfection but then they were out of Naga Dogs. It was the first time we were ever disappointed with this truck.\n\nThe daughter loved the fried candy station.

Last year we went on a Friday night, this year on Saturday at 6:30.  The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived, but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\n\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive, however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway, saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer, however almost all was gone, our choices were Miller Light, wine or water!  It seemed so pointless, so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \n\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00, the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste, but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.  All I kept saying is that I felt ripped off $28 down the drain in 30 min. or less and we were still hungry!  \n\nThe event, in my opinion, was poorly run, poorly organized and the staff seemed a bit clueless (texting, calling & not paying attention).  I feel sorry for the folks who continued to wait in line. I doubt we will return to this event, I'd rather continue our trips down to First Friday (Downtown) and Vegas StrEATs (at El Cortez).

It was the first time I had been to the event, and I missed the turn for the unpaved parking lot and almost drove back out to Dean Martin Drive before making a U-turn of questionable legality. I parked in a section of paved parking that seemed relatively close to the event. There were only about 15 people in line at the nearest gate, and I got my free wristband courtesy of Yelp (thanks!) in relatively short order after asking.\n\nHere's what I had:\n\n- The Maine Lobster Lady: a small bite of lobster mac and cheese from my friend (terribly overpriced entree, food just okay)\n- Seoul Sausage: Part of both the kalbi and spicy pork sausages from Seoul Sausage (both good, spicy pork great)\n- Tornado Potato: truffle oil (lacking salt) and sweet potato (too much added sugar). The visual is impressive. Flavor? Not so much.\n- Nonna's Kitchenette: P.L.T. sliders (nice crispy proscuitto, but I would've liked the tomato to be sliced more thinly)\n- Super Q Food Truck: Super Q Brisket Melt, which does indeed have mac and cheese in the sandwich itself (great overall flavor, filling compared to other stuff)\n\nWhite Castle, which I intentionally avoided even though I haven't tried it yet, may have actually helped draw people away from all the other lines, so I can't hate them. I did see that it got more crowded at night, with maybe hundreds in line just at the entrance gate, so I would recommend that people trying this event in the future go during the daytime and, if possible, on the first day.

We loved the staff and  the bartenders.  The entire setup is absolutely adorable.  I love the colors and the open patio and the brunch options they served.  Everything they served was delicious.  Lindsey was in fine form....always energetic and making this event so much fun.  Can't wait to go back!",1.0,0.999849796295166

All of the adorable dogs dressed up were super cute though.\n\nThe actual run was very laid back, almost too laid back if you really had any interest in running.

It cost me $8.  I suppose because I did not have the flier with me and I did not purchase my ticket on line.  When I got to the event on Saturday afternoon I knew it was going to be crowded as I had to park at the farthest reaches of the parking lot and hike in.  It was crowded.  Too crowded if you ask me.  The ampitheater at the Clark County Government Center is a big enough area perhaps for concerts but not for a festival like this.  All of the venders were set up along a side walk making it difficult to tell where each line led. I stood in three different lines and was there in those lines for the 1 1/2 hours I was there.  The first line was for a not so cold $4 Coors Light that I chugged before it got too warm.  The next line was for food.  I got two chicken kabobs and some fried dough ball with chicken inside.  I wanted one beef kabob but the beef was not cooked yet.  So chicken it was.  Those 3 pieces of food for $15.  Was it good?  Yes.  Was it worth $15?  Not at all.  Anyhow, I stood in a different line as I ate my kabobs.  My next purchase was a three meat sampler.  It was bowl with a sausage link, a piece of bacon wrapped chicken, and a piece of grill sirloin.  All this for $7.  That price was easier to swallow.  So after standing in line for an hour and a half and eating some tasty but pricey food all while listening to some pretty good drum heavy music from the stage, I hiked back to the car wondering if it was worth it.  It was good for an afternoon food outting but not so good that I would care to go to again.",0.0,0.9986502528190612

They also have plenty of retail vendors and of course a small somewhat decent play area for the kids. \n\nThe food however, well I am very disappointed in that. Not enough food vendors, I believe there was only about 8-10 vendors. The Only vendor I recognized was Texas de Brazil, I did order their 3 meat sampler for $7, which of course was juicy and tender as I know their food is delicious. As for everything else, well, not impressed. I also ordered my Caipirinha for $6, which was ok. \n\nAll I'm saying is that for being a Brazilian Festival they should really have more food.

It's such a great event for a chill Friday night outside of Uptown. It's very nice to be able to sample from several food trucks at once but the food trucks only offer regular dinner portions so technically you might only be able to sample 2 food trucks each Friday before you become so full that you won't want to walk back to your car. I suggest hitting up one truck for your entree and side then picking a different food truck for your dessert. :)\n\nIf I were to give any advice for a first-timer out at FTF, it would be to definitely get there early. If you show up at 5pm, you could be one of the first people in line at the food truck of your choice BUT if you show up any later than 5:45, you could be waiting in line for 30 minutes easily. The last FTF I went to, I saw a friend wait in line for an hour for a Papi Queso grilled cheese. Yeah... you would never catch me doing that. \n\nParking is usually a nightmare since there is virtually none at the site so you will have to park somewhere nearby and walk over. You can park in the parking garage in the condo building across Camden for free. I actually park at All American Pub and walk over from there. Oh, and bring your own chairs unless you want to sit on the ground or stand while eating. There are nowhere near enough tables out there for everyone to sit. Also, all of the food trucks take credit/debit cards so you won't have to bring cash if you don't typically have it. Bonus there.\n\nI do love that the food truck scene in Charlotte is growing and I love to support new and local businesses. I highly recommend bringing a few friends out to FTF to try what the Charlotte food trucks have to offer!",1.0,0.6381427049636841

Anymore ideas I will start charging a consulting fee.  I sure hope this review makes it to the event planners.,1.0,0.997688055038452

I had no idea what this event was, but I purchased a Gropuon to do this at a bar right down the street from my house (Del's Bar in Bloomfield). I went in and had a good time. I'm not sure whether our event was BYOB, but everyone who wanted food or an adult beverage just ordered or went to the bar. My one complaint would be that the event seemed to be a bit disorganized, but I think I went to one of the first events so maybe that was the reason. The people doing set up didn't seem to know what they were doing. However, the artist was very knowledgeable and was very helpful through the entire event. We had maybe 15 or so people, and she made sure to spend time with everyone during every step of the process. Not being talented to the art area at all, this was very helpful and enabled me to really enjoy the experience. I was quite surprised at how good my piece turned out. I'd definitely recommend going to one of these events.",1.0,0.9994553923606871

But it was pretty bad start to finish.\n\nParking, indeed was a nightmare. After \nwaiting in line forever to get into the lot, we finally bailed and turned around and parked at the lot by Tempe Town Lake about 1/2 mile away, and just walked to the arts center.\n\nWe finally get to the arts center and see a huge line.  My sister still needed to buy a ticket but we didn't know where to go. Random people passing out wristbands, people just standing around not knowing where to go. It was total chaos.\n\nOnce we get into the event, you have to wait in line after line forever. In the 3 hours we were there, I only got to try a fish taco from Rubios, a small square of pizza from Mellow mushroom, which took extra long because they had run out of pizza. Tomato soup from Lodge but they ran out of the grilled cheese that was supposed to accompany it. \n\nDrinks I only had a sample of (not so great) wine and a beer (they were pretty stingy with the beer pour and my husband made a comment about that). There were a lot of options at the event, but the length of the lines combined with the short event time, made it virtually impossible to try even a fraction of what was there. I didn't even get to see any of the demonstrations or entertainment because 99% of my time was spent in line. No way in hell you are getting your money's worth.\n\nIt was particularly hot today and there was no water to be found anywhere. It's not really foreseeable that it would be close to 80 degrees in Feb, but you do have people drinking alcohol  in the sun all afternoon. Water should have been readily available.\n\nI don't get how this event was so poorly executed?

I certainly don't expect everything to run smoothly.  But REALLY!?!?!  This event was a disaster from start to finish.  \n\nThe parking was ridiculous.  Attendees were directed to a dirt lot but if you were approaching from the west (as we were), getting into the lot was via green yield.  Which meant that things backed up.  At some point, we turned around and approached from the other direction which was slightly better.  While waiting in the hellish line, one person went on ahead (on foot) to grab the will-call tickets.  \n\nEventually, we gave up and parked on 1st street.  Wish we'd done this from the beginning as there was tons of space and it was just a short walk.  \n\nIn general, I avoid will-call because it's just one more line to stand in.  But, this event gave us no other option.  The will call lines were crazy long and I was thankful that we had the foresight to send someone ahead.  \n\nUpon getting our bracelets, we learned that there is a limit on alcohol samples - we had eight tickets with our bracelets.  This was never disclosed pre-event.  Unlimited should mean unlimited.  \n\nThe lines for samples were ridiculously long.  To add insult to injury, some of the samples were just downright sad.  And waiting in a very long line for two swallows of wine is just not my idea of a good time.  \n\nWe happened to note that one restaurant (I forget which one) literally brought a small Weber grill.  Did the organizers not give the restaurants a heads-up on expected attendance or were these guys strangely optimistic? We'll never know.  \n\nWhen all was said and done, the part that bothered us most of all was that we really didn't feel like we got the value out of our tickets.  If we'd each gone to a restaurant and spent $60, we would have had a really nice meal, a cocktail or two and not been cooking for two hours in the Arizona sun.\n\nThe event itself was only three hours long and if you \""wasted\"" any event time on signing up for one of many giveaways, watching the band or the cooking demonstrations, or going to the bathroom, that's time you're not standing in line for the next morsel of food.  \n\nThe Taste in Tempe is literally just that...  a taste.",0.0,0.9993895292282104

The crawfish and corresponding seasoning was absolutely spot on. Very tasty. Not to mention the remaining sides- potatoes, corn, etc. were equally seasoned to perfection. To wash things down, I was also impressed with their drink- the Grasshopper. Not a big fan of martini-like drinks myself so I was a little skeptical how I'd fair at first. But turns out it was crisp, and a very well-balanced proportion of alcohol to mixer. Glad I tried it!\n\nGreat to see Big Boss at this event too. Although I was a fan of the e2 cocktail, I probably couldn't drink that sweet of a drink all night long. It was hard to go out of my comfort zone of their Bad Penny and IPA but I did venture over to a sweeter beer too at one point. Not too bad either.\n\nThe staff and those who helped put this event together, especially our Nikki, ace job.

Last time I went Au Pied de Cochon had a two hour wait just to give you an idea.  I imagine most of those people were waiting to get there hands on a coveted foie gras poutine only to be disappointed as they ran out of that item.

There is also a section of 3rd Street and the lot by Bar + Bistro closed down to make room for a few more vendors.  Most of the downtown stores stay open late this night for your shopping pleasure.\n\nThe first thing I usually do is hit up a food truck to get something to munch on while I check out the art.  Even if you have no intention of buying anything (like me) it's still fun to see what people have designed and how creative they can be.  I always wind up feeling a little inspired.\n\nI grab some more food and then I'm off to look at more art, maybe walk into a gallery or the Gypsy Den, or check out some of the musicians.  The last time we were there (February) we heard a guitar playing duo perform some really great covers of The Killers and Adele.\n\nThe first two times my husband and I went to First Friday it was bitterly cold and we got in pretty early (6ish).  I think these two things factor into the crowd we've been seeing- not a ton of people and mainly younger couples with a few hipsters thrown in.  But for the February event (which was warmer) we did notice a lot more people and a lot more high-school aged kids.  I'm interested to know what the crowd will be like come June.\n\nWhile not perfect yet, I have to give props to Tony and his team for really making First Friday more accessible to the community.  It's nice to have an event that caters to the locals and not all the tourists drinking down on the Strip.

I also went to the Chocolate Affaire for the first time last year...WAS NOT IMPRESSED.  Parking was horrendous.  We had to park several blocks away, which I had not planned on, and with a sore heal to start with, I was hobbling to get there in the 25 minutes it took us to reach the event. \n\n It was a much smaller event that we thought it would be.  Not many chocolate vendors at all...some were out of the treats, the lines were horrible to wait in to get anything.  We went on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, we were done with everything within an hour, and just roamed around to see if there was anything we missed, there wasn't.  \n\nGlendale needs to have many more chocolate vendors.  We only stood in one line to try the chocolate dipped cheesecake, which was wonderful, however, everything was very overpriced.  If you had more vendors, the lines would be spread out better.  I'm surprised there weren't vendors or even home cook-offs...with chocolate cakes, pies, cookies...chocolate wine, hot chocolates, gnache treats, candies, cupcakes, cake pops....many more ideas of chocolate could be offered.\n\nMy friend and I have decided to try it again this year, but if it's the same small event, with too many people, in too small of an area, and too little to offer, we will not attend in the future.  We drive from South Chandler, and it was too far to drive for such an Un-eventful event.\n\nThe review that Aileen gave (the only positive one I saw),makes me think she was one of the people sponsoring the event.  She knew every type of food, and every booth that was there...I don't think this was an honest review by someone just trying to see what the event was like.   I think it was a review from someone who worked there, or sponsored it, trying to get more people to attend.\n\nI hope 2013 gives us \""chocoholics\"" a pleasant surprise with a much better event than 2012.",0.0,0.997782289981842
