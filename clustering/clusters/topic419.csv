Everyone from service staff, to the cooks are learning. They provide excellent, friendly service. It may be a bit slow - but again - they are learning!\n\nThey proved knowledgeable about the menu, and are able to remark about which items are allergy friendly. Items can also be tailored to the customer. I have a gluten allergy, and while they gave me options, I chose two dishes that were already naturally gluten-free. I had the caesar salad and the red fish poele. \n\nThe salad was crisp and fresh, but didn't have as much cheese as I would have liked. Nor did it have the tang I am accustomed to with greek salads. It was tasty, however!\n\nThe red fish did not disappoint. It was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin, albeit questionably presented. The corn ragout and choron sauce complimented it perfectly! \n\nThe desserts had the most impressive presentation. I couldn't have most of them, but I had the pot de creme that accompanied a donut dish. And I must say -- the pot de creme was out of this world delicious! \n\nThey are educated about wine, as well. So bring your refined palate and ask about which wine pairs well with your choice of entre\u00e9! There is an excellent pairing ready for every palate.\n\nCome out to Arizona Culinary Institute and give these students a chance. They are happy to work with you. Note that it is reservation only, so call ahead. Especially make sure to call ahead if you have food allergies! They are all very accommodating and you will definitely enjoy your experience.",1.0,0.9994932413101196

Hands down one of my favorite meals ever. The d\u00e9cor is chic. and parts of the walls were lined with blown-up images of what reminded me of French Impressionist paintings. For starters, I highly recommend the fois gras cr\u00e8me brulee, and sweetbread. I'm not a big fois gras connoisseur, but I loved it in its cr\u00e8me brulee reincarnation. It is served with toasted brioche, which our waiter brought a second round since we devoured our first batch so quickly. The sweetbread dish had probably the best melt-in-my-mouth pork belly I've ever had. Perfect if you love strong savory flavors. For my main course I had the braised beef, and it was flawless. Tender tender.\n\nI did not want this meal to end.\n\nNaturally, I tried to drag this meal out as long as I could, so I got dessert. I had the deconstructed carrot \""cake.\"" Very tasty but having a sweet tooth like mine, I thought it was a bit small. My boyfriend ended his meal with absinthe prepared the traditional way, complete with flaming sugar cube and all. Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable, and spot on with her recommendations. Great service overall.\n\nSage is not to be missed when in Vegas.",1.0,0.9960578680038452

The ambiance was somewhat dark lit, and french/ modern decor. From where we were sitting we could see Las Vegas Blvd and all the beautiful lights. We ordered their CHEESE PLATE to share, and I will say this. Their selection of cheese was really good, it had the mixture of sweet/ salty. Their BREAD is delicious!!! I know, I know... bread? TRY IT!! I ordered the ROASTED BEATS AND KALE SALAD which included kale chips which I thought was a great texture to add to the beats. Along with the salad I ordered the PAN ROAST OF FOIE GRAS which was amazing!!!!! Oh my god the bread pudding with the foie gras was an absolutely wonderful pick. It was a great combination of salty yet sweet. Just from personal experience when I eat too much foie gras I start getting sick of it, but I felt that with the pudding it really balanced it in a way where I could enjoy the whole dish. The experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely come back here again. ENJOY!",1.0,0.9998086094856262

The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is that the restaurant was a little loud and it was hard to hear my fiance talking at times, but sometimes there is nothing to be done about this.\n\nWe ordered the crispy prosciutto and blanched escarole buratta plate and it was amazing. We found a love for buratta while on vacation in sedona and we will never go back to a normal cheese plat again (at least not while buratta is an option!) . The cheese is hand-made in house and the accompaniments could not have been more perfect.\n\nThe boy went for the stuffed chicken breast and I chose the braised short rib. We knew immediately when our food came out I have made the better choice. He insists his chicken was great, but my short ribs definitely stole the show. The goat cheese gnocchi on the side was good until it got cold then it was rubbery, but  now I know to eat it faster.\n\nVery extensive wine list, and fantastic service from the door to the table.

I've noticed that in Quebec there is a certain snootiness.  Maybe they are trying too hard to imitate the French, even in their negative traits, but it definitely exists. But not here.  The waiter was super friendly, very fast and really helped the night flow smoothly. \n\nAs an appetizer we go the brie baked in something, then with some nuts, some sauce and some pears.  Ok, i'm not describing it well at all, but it was awesome!\n\nFor the main course I got the Greek-style lamb. It came with some vegetables, including this beat puree, and freshly made potato chips.  The lamb was absolutely delicious.  I tried a different lamb dish, that also was delicious.  If you come here, get the lamb.  \n\nFor dessert we tried the creme brulee.  I completely agree with Leighann F. This was not the best creme brulee I've had.  Not even in the top twenty.  The sugar was too thick and the creme was too clumpy.  I'm told that means they cooked it for too long.  The taste was fine, but the texture was just off. \n\nHowever, I also got the blueberry tea, which it turns out doesn't have any blueberries in it, but is made of Grand Marnier, Amaretto and hot Orange pekoe tea.  It gets its name because it smells and even tastes amazingly like blueberries.  Definitely something I'm going to ask for in the future! \n\nOverall, amazing experience.
