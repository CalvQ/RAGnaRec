I do not use this word lightly, but I can safely say that I HATE Sonora Quest. I tried to use their online system to pay a bill for myself and one for my child. Their system somehow ran the charge though FIFTEEN times, maxing out our HSA card, and still not paying the bill. After countless phone conversations with them and our HSA card company, it was determined that our HSA company should send them a check, which they did. I called back to ensure that they received the check, and they told me they did. That was in December. Then yesterday (this is now May) I got a notice from a Debt Collection company for $3.53. I called Sonora Quest, and after digging through our account, turns out they failed to apply the $3.53 to my son's bill because my HSA company did not put two Accession numbers on the check! They refunded our card $3.53, then according to them sent us SIX notices for that amount, but we haven't received even one thing (I flat out called them liars), and sent it to Collections. The woman on the phone tried to blame me for not getting my HSA company to put two accession numbers on the check, blame the HSA company for not putting two accession numbers, ludicrous!!! I stayed on the phone until I got her to accept accountability and apologize. A good company recognizes when they make a mistake, accepts accountability and apologizes. They don't try to blame everyone else. Ultimately she admitted that their billing department should have cross referenced our accounts to see if the $3.53 was part of our charges.
