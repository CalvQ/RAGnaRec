The urinal that is a bright-red lipped mouth is a fine idea; however, you blew it when you placed it within 6 inches of the sink, sans partition. \n\nHaving said that...Harris Grill left a taste in my mouth that wasn't the pink urinal puck...it was of the fine Belgian Ale on tap (a clean tap with ample choices from Troeg to Belgian seasonals) and the half-price wings that were keeping me sweaty on the chilly September Pittsburgh patio. Harris Grill goes down as the first place I fully enjoyed a wing sauce that wasn't Buffalo...their Jamaican Jerk made me boogie. \n\nThe pulled pork and slaw was traditional, which I appreciated. \n\nForgo the thought you'll park close to Harris...it's tucked in a great neighborhood...embrace the walk.

I have been to Burger King before, so this review is NOT about the quality of the food. I have eaten at this restaurant before via drive-thru, but this was my first visit where I ate-in. I wish I hadn't. With the scorching summer temperatures and two very bored kids, I figured we'd hit a place with an indoor playground so they could burn off some energy. \n\nWalking in the door, there was an odd smell. It should have been my first sign to turn around and leave. But with two small kids gunning for the playground, there was no way I could drag them back out without eating or playing without a screaming fit. So I pushed on, ordered food and paid. The service was friendly enough. \n\nThe buttons on the drink machine were sticky. Gross. Sign #2 that I should grab my kids and run. The indoor playground had only four tables in a wide open room, with two of them taken and one filthy, I opted for the only table available. The chair was sticky as we sat down. Already, before eating, my stomach churned at the thought of the impending food poisoning. \n\nEverything was filthy at this location. I regret not grabbing my kids kicking and screaming and dragging them from the restaurant.\n\nBut it wasn't until I noticed the large rat house-style trap on the side of the building that I realized what I'd just subjected my family to. \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning. The kids got a head-to-toe sanitizer bath in the car and a full bath as soon as we got home, in hopes of killing some of the germs that are no doubt crawling on every inch of their skin as a result of playing in the playground. \n\nI would rather brave the 115 degree playground than return to this restaurant!

I've always been super polite and nice, and in return so have they. I mean, if you start telling them their food sucks of course they'll become upset (wouldn't you?) But putting that aside, there is a bit of a language barrier so take that with a grain of salt. If we can't understand a comment, they're understanding and repeat what they say kindly. \n\nThe food itself never disappoints. They have the best sesame chicken and Mongolian beef in my opinion, my sister practically fantasizes about the crab Rangoon, and the rest of the bunch enjoy the egg drop soup. There's always plenty to go around if you do the family meal. I would expect leftovers unless you're feeding a football team.\n\nChen's is a little small, and so if you live close takeout might be a good option but we've never had a problem with getting seats pretty quickly on a full day. It's got a China Town vibe, everything is clean, and they even have a spotless family bathroom (some places I've been to don't have that luxury, surprisingly.)\n\nOverall it's a good restaurant and I will be coming back again and again just like I already do.",1.0,0.998271107673645

I honestly got the feeling that a hoarder had a great idea to expand their empire of junk by  opening a restaurant.  And possibly cooking the food in an electric dishwasher in the back.\n\nI decided to try it, going against my initial impression.  I had heard some good things.  But, all of the hippie memorabilia collecting dust from floor to ceiling made me wonder if the health inspectors had checked this place out recently. Strike one.\n\nThe service was lackluster, and almost condescending for someone who works in a burger joint.  One of those situations where the cynical employee (or owner?), unhappy for whatever reason, sneers with his service.  Really?  Completely unwelcoming and I wish I would have smiled and walked out at that point. Strike two.  Not feeling the magic, guys.\n\nI ordered a 'magic mushroom' burger.  It was truly inedible.  I don't consider grease a food group.  I choked down two bites and the rest went into the trash.\n\nFor a town filled with great restaurants where a truly good burger might cost you twice the price, treat your yourself elsewhere folks.

It's located off the 202 Loop near the Bass Pro Shops.\n\nI'm a west coast girl so I've never heard of this place before until I saw it on my way to Home Depot that is in the same area.  I had asked a friend about it and he swore it had the best breakfast he's ever had.  Clearly he's never been to Black Bear Diner!\n\nWent on a Sunday...biiiig mistake.

I know customer service is a thankless job, but sometimes customers are way too cheap and shouldn't be eating out.\n\nBreakfast wasn't so bad, but I found it incredibly bland and laden with salt. Within an hour of eating there I was *parched*. Their \""sourdough\"" pancakes didn't remind me of sourdough in the slightest. Their scrambled eggs seemed to have been made from liquid eggs, solidifying my belief that I'm too young for this establishment. The only true highlight were the corn muffins that were brought out while we waiting.  YUM.\n\nI felt so cheap and tacky walking through Home Depot after while guzzling 4 bottles of water.  Yes, I paid for them. The fluid retention from my salt intake was enough to make me think they had some MSG in their food.\n\nLong review short?

Once you've had it in your mouth, you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason, when my coworkers want to go out for lunch, they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there, the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that, the waitress was very rude and inattentive. \n\nAnother thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends, I want to spend time talking with them, not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement). \n\nMy advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's.
