A-Ok! Prices are a bit steep and food was decent. Good late night grub in my book. I've only been here once during my recent stay at Caesar's. Service was good and our waiter was really nice. No waiting for our group of 7 at 2am. \n\nI ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and enjoyed it. Granted, I was happy buzzin'. Hearty meatballs and tasty sauce. I downed that thing so fast. \n\nIf I stayed at Caesar's again, I may be back.
