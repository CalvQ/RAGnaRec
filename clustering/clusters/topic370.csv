Be sure to earmark about 4 hours for the whole experience including, perhaps, a pricey but tasty snack at the cafe (make a reservation).  We had a really nice time and I do recommend a visit if you are here so you can not only see some great furnishings but so that you may learn some of the history of the economy here.

I had heard many good things about it, and much like the city as a whole, I wasnt disappointed.\n\nThe castle is a short walk from Waverly Station (approximately 5 hours from London via train). The city itself is very easy to navigate, and I definitely recommened seeing everything on foot. There are two paths that I know of to reach the castle--Id say that it is far easier to use the main road rather than wind around the side of the hill. I did the latter and it was a decent leg workout with a heavy backpack.\n\nThe cost of admission was a bit of a disappointment. Compared to Japanese castles which are often free (some charge only to enter the main keep), I found Edinburgh Castle to be pricey. However, the process was made fairly simple with online ticket purchase. You can bring your confirmation number to a ticket machine which will print the tickets for you.\n\nThe grounds are impressive. The castle sits on Castle Rock overlooking all the major points of the city. You can enter several buildings which essentially serve as museums. Of course, the architecture is fascinating--it is a great place for photography. My suggestion would be to avoid peak time, however. I went during the early part of July on a weekend and it was wall to wall people.\n\nPros: Oustanding original castle, beautiful views, iconic piece of Scottish history, easily accessed from Waverly on foot\n\nCons: Can get crowded, a little pricey for admission",1.0,0.9528850317001344

There was a Scottish bagpiper playing that day in front of the War Museum, providing yet another photo op - thank goodness for digital cameras with photos cards with memory for many pix.

Due to the location of the castle, high on an extinct volcanic hill, it overlooks the entire city.  Almost anywhere in the city you can gaze up and see the castle.  It looks amazing in the morning fog and even more spectacular in the afternoon sun.\n\nThis is probably one of the largest castle compounds which I have toured as well.  The castle is quite well maintained and you can get stunning pictures both outside the city walls and within.\n\nOnce inside the castle there is a free guided tour which will walk you through the outside explaining all of the things to see in the castle.  I have been twice and enjoyed this part of the castle tour each time.  I recommend walking with this guided tour (it lasts about a half hour) and then independently exploring the different areas.  The crown jewels, the chapel, the dungeons, the war memorial and the WWI memorial with the top of the black volcanic mountain poking through the floor are probably my most favorite areas to explore.\n\nOn nice days and probably the weekends, the ticket line can be quite long however you can order online in advance or order from the hop on, hop off bus tours and walk straight through.  This saved us some time on our second trip to Edinburgh as our first trip, I spent about a half hour waiting.",1.0,0.999043881893158

It's a CASTLE, and\n2. It sits on a HILL.\n\nSince I love architecture and do photographs, I wanted some of the best vantage points that I could have of the city (and of the castle).\n\nThe only thing about being here in the winter is that you don't necessarily get the \""plays on light\"" against the subject (castle) that you might get in the summertime.\n\nThe other thing that I also liked is that - \n1. Most of it is outdoors, and\n2. It wasn't guided (audio is an option), and I could just roam around freely.\n\nThe funny but eery coincidence is as I was as I had walked into the cellar/dungeon underneath the Half Moon Battery where David's Tower once was, where the Crown Jewels were once hidden/buried, I was reading something about the number of soldiers that had died under siege there. The air got heavy; I felt my heart rate change; and suddenly, some really cool breeze swept over me. \n\nAs I was beginning to take a turn and walk further into the cellar, the lone light bulb in there went out - as did the electricity for the rest of the castle and half of the Royal Mile.\n\nThe Scottish National War Memorial, commemorating soldiers who had died in both of the world wars, was extra-moving after the electricity had gone out. It was my favorite thing there, and extremely moving with the stunning architecture and stained glass. It really prompts you to be silent in there, and with due respect.",1.0,0.9954296350479126

A whopping \u00a316 for a single adult ticket? I'm sorry but WHAT? \n\nOnce I'd got over the initial shock and handed over my cash (rather reluctantly), I made my way around the castle. The views from up there are spectacular. You can see the Firth of Forth and tiny islands popping up out of the water, as well as mountains and hundreds of beautiful old buildings across the city. It's pretty much porn for any budding photographer or Instagram addict.\n\nI was really impressed with the War Memorial, Great Hall and Crown Jewels but I found some areas difficult to navigate and had to ask a member of staff where to go at one point. \n\nAnother thing that annoyed me was the number of ways for those who run the castle to make (even more) money once you're in there. I saw a couple of tea rooms, a whisky shop and two gift shops! \n\nI did enjoy my walk around this awesome, eerie and historic attraction but unless they bring the prices down or decide to crown me Queen Ellie B, I very much doubt I'll be returning.",0.0,0.989953339099884

We went a few days after Christmas and it took nearly 30 minutes to snake to the front of the line. I can't imagine what it's like during the summer.

And you know, I am going to slightly downgrade Edinburgh.  It has the advantage of being in a richly historical city that would be worth a visit even without the castle.  The castle itself also deeply impressive from afar, looming up from a dramatic cliffside (of course, that was just good strategy back in the day).\n\nBut...once inside, all that big bold castley-ness doesn't quite live up to its promise.  The Crown Jewels room is an interminable labyrinth of rooms with creepy mannequins.  When you finally get to the crown jewels they are just meh, although the seat of destiny is pretty excellent just because of its storied past.  The whole place is a bit disney-esque and commercial.  \n\nA few things do stand out.  The views are spectacular.  St. Margaret's chapel resonates with 900 years of history.  There are no fussy mannequins in there, just a real sense of place in this modest, contemplative room.  And the Royal Apartments are pretty interesting.\n\nAll that being said--what are you going to do, NOT go to Edinburgh Castle?  Don't be daft.  Like the Blue Lagoon in Reykjavik and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you have to visit the city's signature landmark before you can do anything else.  And combined with the Princes Street Gardens, the Royal Mile, Holyood and Arthur's Seat, this does make for part of a very historical and beautiful day out.",1.0,0.99749493598938
