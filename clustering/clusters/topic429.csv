The main dish I got, the Shrimp Risotto, was far from impressive. I've had better in a frozen microwave meal. \n\nThe second time I went, which was last weekend, I got the Marinated Flank Steak with a side of potatoes Au gratin. The steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy. The potatoes in the Au gratin weren't cooked all the way through and were just lacking any flavor. The vegetables on the side aren't worth mentioning. \n\nThe service both times I went was fine. Nothing too exciting, nothing to entice me to come back. As for the restaurant itself,  it's a nice looking place, but the food just doesn't live up to it.
