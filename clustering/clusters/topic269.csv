What a difference a few years makes.  Back in the late 90s, I used to ride the Pennsylvanian to H'burg a few times a year.  Took the train this past weekend for a meeting -- out Sunday morning and back yesterday afternoon -- and I was amazed by the experience.\n\nI see the other reviews about the station.  Forget the station.  Any train station.  They're all sad and they offer very little in the way of amenities.  You're not there for the station; you're there for the ride.  \n\nFirst and foremost, the trains were on time for both trips.  In fact, we arrived in H'burg and Pgh EARLY!  \n\nNot only has the on-time performance improved, but the service on the train is MUCH better than I remember.  The conductors and cafe staff are warm, friendly and helpful.   More like hosts than employees.   \n\nNow I did spend the extra $19 to get \""business class\"" seats.  It's a Metroliner car with more room between seats and a power outlet in each row.  AND FREE WIRELESS INTERNET for nearly the entire journey!  You also receive unlimited non-alcoholic beverages and a newspaper.   I think I drank more than $19 worth of beverages on each leg of the trip.   \n\nYea, I could have driven the route in about three hours and the train took five hours, but I arrived in H'burg without being burned out from navigating the gawdawful turnpike.   Plus, I was able to get some work done.  Not as much as I had planned, mind you, because I spent most of the time looking out the window at the scenery.

It's not as conveniently located for me, so I've made far fewer trips on this one.  Unlike the Mon Incline, it doesn't connect with the rail system.  It does, however, connect with several bus routes going between Downtown and the West End at its lower station.  There's also a large parking lot at the lower station.\n\nUnlike the Mon Incline, whose cars are very austere looking, the Duquesne's cars are very ornate.  They are still the original cars from 1877, made out of cherry-wood.  They really creak while en-route!  Also unlike the Mon Incline, the Duquesne Incline is operated by a non-profit preservation society and receives no subsidies.  You can, however, use Port Authority Transit passes and transfers on it (The society does get re-imbursed by PAT for this).\n\nSo here's a suggested itinerary.  Park your car at the lower station.  Ride up the Duquense Incline.  Use the overlook.  Then walk east on Grandview Avenue (beware, there are a couple of wicked hills).  Stop at the overlooks near the Mon Incline, and head back down the Mon Incline.  You can then browse through Station Square and walk through their parking lot to get back to the Duquesne Incline.  Or, you can do the reverse and begin at Station Square.  My now husband and I did so on one of our earliest dates.",0.0,0.9939448237419128

The matter of fact is that this four mile stretch of track is the best thing this city has, and most important. It saddens me that the middle leg was built first, I truely wish they had started phase 1 or 3 first to the airport or to Fremont Street. Everyone is already on The Strip, they want to get to these ends, but oh well, it may never happen at this point because this city has no forward thinkers but anyway. The monorail is the most invaluble asset in this city. It's the only completly dependable bet anywhere near Las Vegas Blvd and we desperately need it. No matter if it's a weekend and Strip traffick is completely jammed or if there is an accident on I-15, the monorail will always without fail get you from Tropicana Ave to Sahara Ave in 15 minutes, no matter what. That's the most important fact people always lookover. You can't put a price on dependability like that when you have somewhere to be and a time to be there at. Hopefully it at least goes to Fremont Street eventually seeing as that is where all the masses of people are always off to, which you would know if you ever ride the Strip & Downtown Express or Deuce to and from Fremont/The Strip. Until then if you ride the monorail to Sahara Station and take the escalator to street level, directly to your left you will see the station platform for the SDX. It's not too bad on a busy weekend if you are trying to get between The Strip and downtown as nothing will get you out of the mess on Las Vegas Blvd faster than the monorail, and from Sahara the Strip & Downtown Express only makes three additional stops before you get to Fremont Street then it continues on to the Outlet Mall and new downtown. I like to this of this as the temporary monorail extension if you will. If you have an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center, then the monorail really is second to none in this case. If you're staying at any property on the east side of The Strip then a tree day pass would do you wonders! To your convention, back to the hotel, out to dinner or a show, back to your hotel. It'll be worth it for you people, I promise. Now if only it took you back to the airport too.....\n\n     My point is this city needs this service and I hope it is here and extended for decades to come. I use it to get to work at MGM Grand and I can't believe how many times it has got me to work in time when I would have been late because of an accident of the 15 or a major even getting out blocking you from parking.

Because I started commuting to work via Valley Metro Light Rail, I haven't put gas in my car in 8 weeks.\n\nSAVES MONEY. Instead, my work subsidizes my 31 Day Local METRO card, so I pay $22.50 each month to ride the clean, efficient, on-time train.  Even the $1.25 full fare one-way or $2.50 full fare all-day passes are reasonable, and you can transfer to the bus system on the same are.\n\nSAVES TIME.

(If you're that bearded man who ignored me, I forgive you.)  People complain of a sprawling, impersonal Phoenix that is allergic to local community.  Well, then, I try to make Phoenix as local as possible by taking the train, frequenting local independents, and trying to be a part of the community solution.\n\nSAVES BIKES.  I mean this quite literally.  I ride my bike 1.5 miles to the rail station and when the train comes, I raise my bike up onto the hook (or sometimes just stand with it) in one of the four slots per car, and then I chill.  The bike amenities make the Light Rail + Bus system a nearly full-feature mass transit system.\n\nTHE NEGATIVE.  Other yelpers have noted the limited night-time hours of operation (save the occasional extended hours for a Suns game).  I agree that the City of Phoenix should step in and use the light rail as an opportunity to extend hours on weekends as an overture to stem the drunk-driving rampant in AZ.  Also, and this is very minor, one morning the doors closed before I could enter with my bike.  When I pressed the yellow button, nothing happened; when a sympathetic passenger inside the train pushed the inside button, nothing happened.  I was on time for the train but the train would let me enter.  \n\nThanks, Voters of Arizona, for approving the transportation sales tax necessary to begin, sustain, and complete construction on this pulse-providing, community-building light rail system.",0.0,0.9978609681129456

After living in LA and using the metro subway there, anything seems cleaner than that. Let's just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.\n\nNice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also, it's one of Phoenix's more serious efforts at going green, so it's worth backing.\n\nNice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off, something is always walking distance.\n\nNice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.\n\nNice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA, the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There don't seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30's in LA.\n\nThe cons...\n\nBad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that it's essentially a car you don't have to park or fill up on gas. It's not that it's slow, but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea would've been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.\n\nBad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage, but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix, Scottsdale, or Glendale. I've heard that they are planning a Glendale route, but that's probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops, I really wish I wasn't limited to downtown, Tempe, or Mesa.\n\nBad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean, there is, but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.\n\nBad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? We're not children. This city shouldn't set a curfew before midnight on this.\n\nIn all, the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. It's got its kinks that it still needs to work out and it's kinda tough to judge something that's in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.",0.0,0.8871148824691772

The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! \n\nOkay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?\n\nI like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it.

Although traffic is not as bad as Los Angeles, I just wanted to relax to and from my games. The Valley Metro Light Rail is the perfect way to get to and from Downtown Phoenix.\n\nFor just $4, you can get an All Day Pass and travel on the rail. I am not sure if the Day Pass works for the buses as well. Most of the time, I park my vehicle at the Montebello & 19th Station near the Christown Spectrum Mall. There are very few stations with Park & Ride Lots that you can use. \n\nThe Light Rail Trains (LRT) are very interesting. Although the doors are closed, you just press a button to open the door and walk into a very COOL and well maintained air conditioned train. With a lot of transients, it was very hard to to see any graffiti or any damage inside the train. That shows you that Valley Metro takes care of their trains. There are bicycle racks on the train to provide space on board the trains. However, it can get too packed on very busy days\n\nThe LRT stops at the important stops such as malls, airport, and more importantly for me, Chase Field for any baseball game. Whether you are watching the Phoenix Suns Game or Arizona Diamondbacks Game, the LRT will get you there faster and cheaper. If you are waiting at LRT Station, there are some parts of the station that there is a button. That button is an AC Cooler. It is very interesting. Just push the button and you can be cool for a few moments. I like how Valley Metro is thinking for their customers and making sure they are cool on hot days. \n\nLike my Dodger Games, I try to take the train whether its in Atlanta, Los Angeles, or Phoenix, I've got to experience how other people get to their games.

It's small and simple, with platforms you can count on one hand that only go in particular directions. It allows me to get to and from Manchester Piccadilly without having to change trains. Bonus! (Disclaimer: ELH hates changing trains. I have a habit of making myself ridiculously at home during journeys of any kind which involve sitting down, and changing trains means I have to undergo that process twice. No.) The stairs do make it tricky, to back up Marj, especially if you've come armed with both a travel case on wheels and a box containing 12 bottles of Corona, lemons, limes, houmous and pitta bread (private inside tradition, it'll become clear). But that's precisely the same as Oxford Road, weirdly.\n\nConsidering it's only a small distance away from central Edinburgh, it's certainly worth using (after all, you have yourselves such a lovely little city which can be traversed almost entirely on foot.

If there is a corner untouched, you'll probably find another platform launched into it. There are platforms that start halfway down other platforms. There are platforms within platforms. \n\nWith all of the construction work currently underway to improve the station, the labyrinthine properties of Waverley get even more confusing. I am pretty sure that the numbering sequence took place while the number manager (OK I made that one up, can you tell?) was high on mushrooms. It feels like a lifetime walking from one part to another, but as I learned recently, those lifetimes tend to take under a minute, it just feels longer. There definitely feels like there is a drive to modernise this station, but there are curious anachronisms in this intent. Every platform has a gaggle of inspectors - even at the automated gates, you can avoid mixing with technology and have your ticket checked (for the gazillionth time) by a human being. Whereas in London, where it's a 'no ticket no travel' ethos, Edinburgh gives you a break, and allows you to purchase a ticket at any point on your trip. I like that. \n\n*CUE WHINGE*\nPlatform announcements for changes are announced not by tannoy, but by an inspector charging up and down the platform. It sometimes feels a little bit risky clambering on a train - not 100% knowing if the train is going to be the right one, or actually leave (I have been stuck on a train for 20mins at Waverley, with no explanation as to why we hadn't moved). So, in (brief) conclusion, Waverley seriously flags when it comes to keeping the customer informed as to train changes or delays.\n\n*CUE FLASHBACK*\nI remember as a kid, driving into the warm, fume-filled belly of Edinburgh, when the train entrance and exit were available to public traffic, picking up my grandmother from another long trip from the South. Walking through the centre of the station, these memories continue to flood back, every day. \n\nThe Victorian design ethics still remain in the core of station, and so far it is hard to tell how well the two concepts (modern, glass and steel vs. wrought iron and stone) will mix together, until all the construction goes it's merry way.

Also, the odd character to average character ratio is quite low in comparison to cities like NY, Boston, and SF. It doesn't hurt that the trains look like some kind of futuristic transportation from Total Recall.

Really...shouldn't there be a single button for a single ride? (I know, now somebody is going to point out that said button does exist). That's OK, the 27 screens increase the fun and tension as the train approaches. \n\nFor going out in Tempe and Phoenix this is the way to go, even without the 24\"" rims.

It does need to be improved, but it is a good addition to the city, and I can't wait until they expand it so I can use it to get to more places. \n\nPositives:\n-Convenience. I happen to live close to a station and work close to a station, so it doesn't get any easier than that. Even if you don't happen to live near a station, there are several Park & Ride stations for you to leave your car and take the train uptown for a night out, a performance, or a game. \n-In general, the trains are clean, well-kept, well-lit, and not too crowded. I feel safe taking it and waiting by myself at the stations.\n-For the most part the trains run on-schedule at reasonable intervals. \n\nRoom for improvement:\n-The stations provide absolutely no weather coverage. Have you ever missed your train? Because I have more times than I'd like to admit, and have been stuck waiting for the next one in the rain. Yes, I was under the awning, but the awning doesn't do anything. Even the large covering at the Uptown CATS station leaves much to be desired. \n-The trains need to run later hours, at the very least on the weekend. This is not just for the party crowd either. I work in a restaurant that closes at 11 on the weekends, and sometimes servers don't get out until almost 2 am, especially if they're closing. Sucks for you if the last train left at 1 am. There are groups of people besides the 9-to-5ers that depend on the CATS system to work the night shift.\n-Trains need to be scheduled better when there are events uptown. Panthers game? Concert at Time Warner? Street festival? SCHEDULE MORE TRAINS. And run a double-length instead of a single-length.

The open roof feeling of being underneath main roads doesn't sit well with me, because it rains here and it is cold here more than it is warm so why an open roof. And being from California being underneath big things that can collapse just rubs me the wrong way, almost as much as finding out that the trains to London are on a track all by itself not with the others. They realize that people drink or wake up way too early to get on trips right?",0.0,0.998823583126068
