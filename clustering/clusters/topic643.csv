It was actually a peaceful stroll from store to store for us. I wonder if someone said something to them or complained, or maybe they were simply all tired? It was a major difference this time as in past visits where we would be mobbed by every cart vendor. Anyhow it was refreshing to be left alone because, No I don't want my ring cleaned... No I don't want to ruin my nails by testing your magic nail polish...No I don't want to watch you iron and press a shirt...No I don't want you to ruin my makeup with a crappy facial in public because your cleanser will not magically make me look or feel younger....catch my drift?\n\nMy honey bunches of oats loves DC so I enjoy checking out the Lids store for new DC caps for him. \n\nThis visit we hit the jackpot at The Converse store (see review).\n\nThis outlet mall is worth checking out for sure as there is a lot of great merchandise for a fraction of the cost indeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am very kinky.",1.0,0.9923559427261353

Why, even now, would you go to Borders?\n\nTheir prices are the highest you'll find for most every product they sell.

Why would I pay $30 for a new release?  Why would I pay more for a book that I could get on Amazon for 20%-30% less?

Pricing is a little high, but like apparently all other craft stores, they have an endless supply of 40-50% coupons. \n\nI think I'm over my crush due to my first experience trying to return something. So heads up - they won't let you return something if they already have a full inventory on the floor. Supposedly because they have a limited storage area in the back, but I'm really not sure how that's supposed to be my problem. \n\nI bought a picture frame from this same store, returned it in the original packaging, with a receipt, and within the return period. And yet this is the BS answer I was told, and the manager backed it up - citing the ridiculous fine print  on their receipt saying they have the right to refuse returns for any reason. That disclaimer usually applies to people trying to return obviously used underwear or a half eaten candy bar, not a perfectly intact picture frame. \n\nThey may have cute decor stuff, but I won't be back simply due to their stupid return policy.

I am cheap, what can I say?\n\nThis store may not be as big as some I have been in, but it is great for when you know exactly what you want and you can get in and out as quickly as possible.

Throwing my items into the bags is not very nice. I probably would have laughed if the cleaner exploded in your face. Maybe she was mad because she was the only person checking people out.
