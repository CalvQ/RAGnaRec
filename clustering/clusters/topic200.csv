The omelettes are great as well as their pancakes- like a little bit of everything? Go with the M\u00e9nage. \n\nThe coffee selections are great and the fresh juices hit the spot, this is a great scottsdale staple with delicious food, local art for sale and a casual vibe.

I was eyeing the fried chicken and biscuits or the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Only a mile away, we hopped in a cab and were seated immediately. \n\nBest cure for a hangover? MORE DRINKS!!!  While the unlimited mimosas, bellinis and bloody Mary's definitely sounded appealing, they have a great beer selection so I went that route. FYI the wait or said those unlimited are interchangeable so you can bounce from a mimosa to a bloody, etc. I'm a Belgian drinker and they had a few of my favs so I drank bottles of Trappistes Rochefort 10, followed by Westmalle Tripel after the food came out. What hangover?!  \n\nWe both ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes and I'll actually have to say I was pretty disappointed. On one hand, they served their purpose and soaked up last nights intoxication, on the other hand, the pancakes looked much more amazing than they truly were. Perfect in appearance, they were a little doughy and truly lacked flavor. I felt like I was eating bland white bread. They were so doughy that I had to look and make sure they were actually cooked. Neither the blueberries not the sauce were sweet and we actually ended up putting syrup on them. A lightly flavored lemon ricotta ball was placed on top of the pancakes just like butter normally is and that wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Sadly the food was nothing to write home about. I will say their chicken sausage was very good though. The highlight of brunch lol.  Welp at least the service was on point lol. Food 6.5/10. Service 8.5/10. Atmosphere 8/10",0.0,0.9953091740608216

Best thing in Vegas by far! I am notorious for my epic hangovers that leave me incapacitated and dry heaving until 5 pm the next day... so naturally when I went to Vegas this past weekend (8/16-8/18) for my bachelorette party, I'm anticipating losing a whole day due to a hangover. Sure enough, after a night of table service at Marquee, I wake up at 8am with a splitting headache and puking up Secret Pizza (tastes great going down... not so much coming back up) from the night before.\n\nI had heard about Hangover Heaven and read a few articles so was game to try anything that might get me back to my weekend and alleviate the hangover hell I was currently in. My friend called them up and they sent a car right over to Cosmo within 10 minutes to pick us up. The clinic was nice and clean... and as soon as the staff saw the shape I was in, they quickly had me signing a consent for treatment and into a recliner chair. After a quick medical hx and vital signs, Dr. Burke came over and explained what was going to happen. After the shot of lidocaine, I didn't even feel him place the IV and soon I had a bag of saline hooked up along with a push of pain meds and anti-emetics. Within 20 minutes... my symptoms had started to subside and Dr. Burke and his staff continued  to check up on me. When I reported still feeling some nausea about 30 minutes in, they gave me another round of anti-emetics and it did the job. All in all, I received 1 1/2 bags of saline, a banana bag (rehydration/vitamin mix that is yellow), a push of pain meds, two pushes of anti-emetics, and anti-oxidant over the course of one hour. He also threw in a b-complex shot because of the construction that was going on during my treatment. \n\nI staggered in to Dr. Burke's clinic vomiting and barely functional, unable to even fully verbalize the English language... by the end of the treatment, I was laughing and talking with my friend and thinking about what to eat for breakfast. Dr. Burke is friendly and extremely capable, as is his staff. They communicated everything they were doing, as they were doing it, and explained what each medication was for before administering it. I felt very comfortable in his care and wouldn't think twice about coming here again if need be. Thanks to him, I could actually enjoy the remainder of my weekend. His services are worth every penny!

In order to get over my hangover I started off with a water, a diet pepsi and a bloody mary. I followed that with a full plate of mac and cheese, french toast, pizza, mushroom ravioli, large plate of desserts.  They had a wide variety of food (seafood, salad bar, craving stations, asian stir fry) but I was grease focused there was no room for salad or seafood on my plate. \n\nDid I mention they have unlimited booze? Check it out! Your pounding headache will thank you! \n\nBrunch is no joke in my book.",0.0,0.9967641830444336
