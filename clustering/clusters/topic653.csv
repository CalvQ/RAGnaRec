Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. \n\nI finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. \n\nI also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.",0.0,0.9818068742752076

Considering we were going to be at the pool all day, I didn't mind sitting inside.\n\nEverything on the menu looked so delicious. I decided to get the French Toast with a side of crispy bacon. The French Toast was topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup, and fresh whipped cream. It was sooo delicious! The portions were pretty big, so I gave the other piece to my husband. He agreed that I ordered the better dish. He was trying to be all healthy and what not by getting the Turkey & Egg White Omelette. Lesson learned.

We were going to another breakfast place in the DC Marketplace but the wait was over 30 minutes, so we decided to head over to Herb Box.  I have heard so many good things about Herb Box's brunch and I am so glad we went because it was the best brunch I have had in a long time! \n\nLuckily, there was no wait to be seated and we were seated inside the restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and quick to take our drink orders. I ordered a vanilla latte, Shannon ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband ordered mango lemonade. For brunch, Shannon ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes and my husband ordered an omelet. I couldn't decide between the cinnamon pancakes or the bourbon peach French toast and asked our waitress which was better. She told me that the French toast was definitely a favorite and was almost sold out for the day. I jumped on that and was so glad I did. \n\nOur drinks arrived shortly and I really liked my latte. It came in a tall clear glass, reminiscent of what you'd normally serve an Irish Coffee in. My latte was both sweet and bitter at the same time which was delicious. Shannon enjoyed her orange juice since it was freshly squeezed and sweet. My husband enjoyed his mango lemonade but I thought it was a little watered down.\n\nNext, our food arrived. Upon first bite of my French toast, I was in heaven. My husband described it like eating bread pudding for breakfast and he was right. It was both heavy and light at the same time and the flavors were outstanding. I didn't even need the maple syrup they serve alongside it - the bourbon did an excellent job. It came with bacon and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Shannon enjoyed her pancakes and I tried a bite. It was truly like eating cake - super moist and chocolaty. My husband enjoyed his omelet and I agreed it was delicious. The Brussels, manchego and pancetta really blended well together. \n\nOverall, it was a fantastic brunch.

I had heard about this joint on man vs. food and I had to check it out!  We arrived at about 8:30, and we had about a 10 minute wait.  Not too bad!!\n\nAfter that, though, the service got a little spotty.  It took forever for our waitress to come to the table for the first time, we needed to ask for a lot of things twice in order to actually get them (like syrup, napkins, water, PLATES).  It was sort of frustrating in that respect.\n\nBut the FOOD.  Oh maaaaaan the food.  My husband and I couldn't decide what to get, so we decided to split three things.  Our waitress sort of tried to talk us out of it saying \""it's a lot of food, you know\"".  I said that we were aware--we saw Man v Food.\n\nBut anyway, we got the french toast with a side of eggs over hard and bacon, the farmhouse scrambler (chicken and peppers mixed with eggs) and that comes with a biscuit and crispy potatoes.  The last thing we ordered was the Snickers pancake.  This was at LEAST a food wide (see picture).\n\nOverall, the food was delicious!  The highlights of the meal for me were the Snickers pancake (of course)  This thing was SO fluffy!  It was like having more than one pancake stacked on top of another!  Also, the crispy potatoes were to die for--they had an amazing crunch.  I also really enjoyed the flavor of the french toast.  There was just a hint of banana without being overwhelming! \n\n Seeing how my mouth was busy nomming on the snicker's pancake, my husband downed the bacon and eggs and said those were really good (why he chose the bacon and eggs over the deliciousness of the pancake, I will never know, but I was grateful!  More for me!\n\nThe farmhouse scrambler was just \""ok\"".  It wasn't really a standout among the amazingness of the other dishes.  Maybe if I had ordered it somewhere near me where it wouldn't be in competition with other more spectacular selections, it would have fared far better.\n\nSo come for the food, and try to ignore the service.

The breakfasts come with hash browns and a toasted, already buttered English muffin. However, the hash browns tasted like they were prepared in a large batch and kept in a warming pan until served.  They were not particularly tasty and lacked the flavorful crunchiness of freshly cooked potatoes.  The omelet was just okay, nothing special with crunchy green peppers and sauteed onions, diced ham inside.  There was a small amount of cheese on the top, but noticeably lacking inn the interior.  My hubby commented that  the corned beef has could have been more appealing, but enjoyed the fresh tomatoes served with the meal.  I don't know if it is the glass/plastic serving plates they used, but the food was cold before we were half way through it.
