Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.\n\nIt's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.\n\nOur waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.\n\nWe started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.\n\nWe finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.\n\nOverall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!). Christos' saving grace is its ambience and staff. Check it out if you have the time.",1.0,0.9953308701515198

While the salad bar is extensive, the soup bar fell short. There are no vegetarian/vegan soups. They did have a black bean soup and when I asked if they used chicken/beef/veggie broth no one could tell me so I just avoided it. So you feel like you get your money's worth there are lots of bread, baked potatoes, mac & cheese, pasta dishes desserts, etc. to fill you up. The best part of my meal was a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie. \n\nWill I return to Sweet T's? Magic 8 ball says probably, the people watching is unbeatable.",0.0,0.9983736276626588

I walked in, it's a cluttered place, divey is the word, located on the corner of a strip mall. What normally would be a deli case is filled with boxes as you enter. There was no greeting from the 3 people behind the counter and towards the back.\n\n3. I go to the table - 2 placed together - to meet my fellow 3 diners. No menu provided, no service to the table.\n\n4. Only 5 feet from the counter, I asked the person behind the counter for help. At several points, nobody was present for service of any sort.\n\n5. The cashier/order taker? When asked what was their best dish and what would he recommend, he basically said he didn't know. At another point, our table mates asked about the size of the dish and he strongly suggested they order the large size. They wanted the 'SM' size - they were right, he was wrong.\n\n6. We had a lot of questions of what was what, e.g. Calaloo, Ackee, Escoveitched Fish, Roti. The responding answers were only somewhat helpful at best. Frankly, I want the person working there to have a good idea of what items are and be able to suggest items.\n\n7. When asked about the Coco bread, he stated, \""It's just bread\"" and he pointed at the loaf. \n\n8. We had a side order of a 'Beef Patty' which I thought resembled Cherry pie from 7-Eleven. I do not see/taste the allure of it.\n\n9. Three of us had the Jerk chicken. The menu states all meals are served with peas - not true. None was provided.\n\n9. On the good side, the dead Jerk Chicken was normal and the rice was good. The Red Stripe beer was good as well.\n\n10. When the food came out, it was all in styrofoam with plasticware. Even at divey, hole-in-the-wall places, one normally gets plates and silverware but not here.\n\n11. In the end, it took about 10 minutes to obtain the bill, apply the discount, double-check on the split of who pays what part of the bill, and then finally receiving the credit slip to sign.  \n\n12. I've read some other reviews and I suppose, if there is a good dish that you like, e.g. Tripe soup, Oxtails, Ackee, Cowfoot Stew, Curry Goat, Salt Fish, go there and try it. Don't count on any service or explanations, or even suggestions. Or silverware. Or actual food in the deli cases. \n\n13.

Party of eight was seated w/o a wait, which was nice.  But, we were seated at two tiny round tables they'd pushed together which didn't really afford us the space or intimacy we really needed.  \n\nVery much entertained by the scores of people that tripped on a step while coming or going.

Ordered the grilled cheese, which the menu touted as \""truly\nthe best grilled cheese you'll ever have.\""  Should have sent back what came out:  a somewhat squishy cheese goof up, topped w/ the same bacon (?) that earlier had brought meaning and purpose to those water chestnuts, this time a touch undercooked.  Parts of the sandwich were actually wet, presumably from the juice of some unsqueezed tomatoes.  By that time I'd had a few too many beers to care, much.  Bloody Mary was definitely bland.\n\nMost bizarre point of the evening came when the waiter, possibly confused by the cork, tried to serve my single serving Lindemans Lambic Framboise like it was a fine wine, showing off the label and waiting for me to taste before he continued pouring.

Even the noobies were in awe by the majestic slabs of pork belly staring them in their eyes. PORK BELLY GET IN MY BELLY!!! \n\nRound 5: \nMarinated beef short ribs (Galbi). We finished off the feeding with something marinated. Not that big of a fan, but it was good. I'll pho'ks with it. \n\nHoney Pig's brisket and pork belly got me hooked again.

So, in deference to her opinion let me quite upfront with what she deservedly does not like about the place.  Two words... \""no substitutions\"".  Now, if you suffer from the affliction of being a picky eater...first, my condolences...secondly, you know the need to have some control over the food presented to you.  This is not an option for kevin sousa's menu at yo moma,,,woops! I mean \""yo rita\"".  The other issue is that the bartender was less than expected and made a drink that sounded delicious on the menu nearly undrinkable.  The space itself is quite pleasant.  There are high ceilings, a big bar to the right, plenty of tables.  your appropriate amount of hipsters and yuppies (and I'm using these terms (including this yuppie) in the most unflattering sense possible.  There also are some interesting candles and what looks like copper artwork on the wall.  Here is what I really like about the place....\""the food\"".  I don't know of anywhere in the burgh' where I can get such interesting tacos as \""freshwater eel\"", soft shell blue crab\"" or \""chicken livers\"",,, for a \""foodie\"" (another word I despise!) the ability to have simple street food reinvented with interesting ingredients is a bit of a revelation especially when cooked properly, which for the most part these were.  I had the chicken livers taco which was served on a flour tortilla with shredded cabbage, perfectly season and flavored fried chicken livers, bacon,,, lemon garlic aioli and guava (although the guava was barely noticeable).  This was $5 and was a nice portion of my first chicken liver taco,,, another first was the duck taco.  The duck was cooked perfectly medium, think of the best piece of juicy moist duck breast you've had with a little crispy skin and this was that.  However, imagine wrapped in a tortilla with fresh cilantro, jalapeno and a nice fig chutney.  Annie was able to eat the chicken livers, but that was about where her dining experience ended.  If the service was a bit better, the drink prepared properly this may have earned four stars. It may even deserve 3 1/2 stars now but that's not an option.  I'll be back and I look forward to chef sousas' other venture in garfield (I think?) if he can ever get it \""off the ground\"".",1.0,0.9961877465248108

I could give Graze 5 stars on atmosphere alone. When you walk in you are immediately impressed by the high ceiling and the huge windows. The natural lighting and modern decor make simply being here an experience. There is a beautiful view of the capitol out of a wall that's just a giant piece of glass, and looking around the restaurant I seemed to be surrounded by politicians and bankers having their fancy business lunches.\n\nMy waitress was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Her ability to speak at such great length about Graze's food demonstrates that they take pride in their quality, and it exhibits a professionalism reminiscent of a gourmet restaurant.\n\nHowever, the food wasn't particularly amazing, with a few notable exceptions. The falafel po-boy that I ordered was amateurish; while the bread and vegetables were excellent, the chef should stick to what he knows. I lived in the Middle East and can recognize a legit falafel. The falafel and hummus here reminded me of the canned stuff that I get from the Arabic grocery store. The fries were just alright; I loved that they served them with mayonnaise rather than ketchup though.\n\nThe soup du jour (butternut squash) was far too savory for me. If you're going to make a soup that thick and creamy, you can't make it that sweet. It seems like the skill was there to make excellent soup, but unfortunately, the execution wasn't. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a great grilled cheese sandwich, albeit that it was simple and imitable. Graze's dedication to high-quality ingredients is what allowed it to stand out. Their choice of mustard for it gave it a very interesting taste, and the cheese was incredibly fresh.\n\nSpeaking of cheese, I absolutely love the cheese curds. They were completely unlike any other curds I've had, but there's nothing wrong with that. They were much larger than usual, and whereas your average cheese curd is 50% batter, this one was light and fluffy, with a very thin and sweet breading. These monstrous cheese curds were little meals and cost only $7. One basket was enough for four people.\n\nThe Graze has so much going for it, so it's tough to stomach that I'm not exactly getting the best food I've ever had here. If they showed just a little more consistency and cooking ability, they could be one of the best restaurants in town.",1.0,0.993211269378662

I drove by our the other night to see some people in the bar and got excited to know that it was finally open. \n\nMy friend and I went there yesterday for some food. Starting with the service, it was good. Our water cups were always filled, and they checked in on us a lot. Although, at some points it was a bit incessant. But, if rather have over the top service than no service at all. Plus, we were the only table there for awhile. Our server, Deena, made things a bit awkward. There was just a lot of awkward silences, and it always seemed like she was whispering, but I can look past that. \n\nAs far as the food goes, it felt like there were more appetizers to choose from then there were entrees. Which, probably is a good thing because the appetizers we got were far better than the entrees. \n\nWe started with the Portobello fries and the crispy gnocchi. The fries were thick slices of Portobello that were lightly breaded then fried. They.served it with ranch, and some other sauce that I'm falling to remember. The crispy gnocchi had Italian sausage, pesto, peas, and walnuts. While it was good, unless you get a piece of sausage in every bite, the dish lacks a bit of salt. \n\nFor entrees, we offered the turkey and cranberry sandwich as well as the jambalaya. I don't know what o was expecting out of the turkey and cranberry sandwich, but I was just expecting more. While the cranberry sauce was good, they added quite a bit, so it overpowered everything else. Their version was a little more spruced up, with spinach and brie cheese. However, the cheese wasn't spread at all, just one slice in the middle. So, I only got one or two really good bites out of the sandwich. As far as the jambalaya, it was decent. Had good flavor, but just needed more. It war very mild tasting. Chicken was conned ti perfection though, so moist ! No sausage in the jambalaya thigh. :( \n\nAll in all, would I go back ? Probably. It's the closest place to eat next to my house. I'll probably stick with just ordering more appetizers next time though.",0.0,0.9922926425933838

I really wanted to like this place, I've heard amazing things about the Tempe location (which unfortunately I haven't been to) and was excited that there was a location nearby to visit. The location itself is really cute. It kind of reminds me of NCounter in Tempe. \n\nPositives: \n-It's a really cute cafe. The decor is kitschy and cute, with a huge mixer in the front. I like the overall minimalist design.\n-I like the fact that you order at the counter, even though in a large group it can be a little annoying to have food come out in rounds. \n-I can see why people come here, for the baked goods. I got a chocolate croissant to share with my group and everyone agreed it was delicious. \n-The food was pretty delicious. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and the banana caramel sauce is to die for.\n\nOnto the unfortunate negatives:\n\nIssue #1: The staff was inconsistent. Either they were overly friendly & attentive or couldn't be bothered. Case in point-The lady who took my order was very friendly & peppy. She was very helpful at offering suggestions and even up sold me on getting a pastry to share with my group while we waited for our food. Once we got our food, it was difficult to flag any of the staff down if we needed anything and if we were successful-it took an awfully long time to get what we asked for. \n\nIssue #2: My friend and I ordered the exact same dish but got different amounts of food. My friend noted that she felt it was overpriced for what she was getting, but then was kind of upset to see that my order had way more potatoes than hers did. There should be a standard there, especially if it's pretty obvious we're at the same table?\n\nIssue #3: The amount of time it took for our food to arrive. I understand if you're like crazy busy, but it was only moderate on our visit. Each of us pretty much ate our entire meal before the next person got their food. I understand we ordered separately but the timing was pretty close between orders. \n\nPerhaps this place is experiencing growing pains? I don't know. I'd like to make a return visit, but I will probably wait a bit. Hopefully I can update this review with more stars.",1.0,0.8747485876083374

You park in one of the most shady shopping centers in I can think of, walk in to Cornish Pasty Co., and shortly forget you're still in the shady shopping center.

How do I spell the plural form? It doesn't matter. I ate pasties. If you don't know what you're getting into - these are extremely fancy hot pockets. Outside is dough baked to a hard shell. Crumbly even. Inside is a pocket with ingredients of your choice. I can't speak for the freshness or process of creation. They could be bundled up fresh when you order them, or they're premade, frozen, and then cooked by request. Either way, I'm not sure I'm sold on the food.\n\nHaving the salmon pasty, it was dry. The salmon was likely cooked before it entered the pasty. A few ingredients here and there. It tasted fine. If you're familiar with my reviews, this is a little uncharacteristic of me. It's \""fine.\"" But it was. I honestly don't remember much about it. The same goes for the others I tried around the table. They are all fine. They all taste like what they say they will. Something is missing, though. They are lifeless. I'm not even sure how I'd fix that. I just wasn't into it. I want that moment of \""mmm, that's so good!\"" Some juices leaking from the slice, maybe some steam... This goes for the chips, too. And by chips I mean fries covered in jalapeno bits. They come out sliced larger than your standard fry, but on the burned side. Crunchy, dry, and lifeless.\n\nI'm the wrong person to comment on this but one huge benefit to coming here must be their selection of alcohol. Just glancing around different tables revealed a variety of labels I'd never seen. If you like beer, you may be in a little heaven of your own.\n\nSeating is on benches and long wooden tables.

Yes, I was reared in the pastoral Driftless Zone, home to some of the best dairy in Dairyland. Yes, I am quite fond of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream (which, in Madison, is carried here and only here).  However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude. \n\nI stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it's not as extensive as I'd expect--despite Fromagination's artful arranging I'd venture a guess that Whole Foods' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can't handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn't quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \""Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\"" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \""Ma'am, I'm having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.  But I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.\"" Clearly embarrassed, he turned and walked out.  \n\nThat's the most extreme example I've witnessed (though on separate occasions I've heard people say \""I have money to spend here...\"" as they stood, stymied by the lack of attention) but it exemplifies the general vibe pretty well.  With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I'm there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I'm merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they'll steer me away from it! \""This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that's what you want?\"" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.  Thanks!  \n\nI will keep going to Fromagination, especially because the shop takes great pains to promote local/regional cheese makers, but I hope they consider the constructive criticism and perhaps start having fun with the idea of selling cheese.",1.0,0.8862144947052002

This isn't the type of place where I'd normally choose to eat, but in the one case I was meeting friends here, and in the other I was meeting family here.\n\nTheir menu is predictable bar food with a larger than usual selection of seafood. The bar is typical with some good specials usually going on. The service is meh. My friend ordered a Mojito with extra mint and asked if they could \""muddle the heck out of the mint.\"" When the waiter brought it over, it had about four leaves of unbruised mint in it. And this, after he broke a glass on our table and the drink spilled into two purses. I found this to be sort of comical as I have NO idea how the glass broke when he set it down. However, no drink was bought for my friends with soggy purses and it took another 10 minutes to get a replacement. Boo! One more thing to note: On game nights, this place gets crazy packed.. like waiting for an hour to find a seat type of packed.\n\nI've tried their signature \""Zingers\"" which are just glorified chicken fingers tossed in buffalo.\nTheir fisherman fry (it's called something close to that) which comes with a variety of fried sea goodies was only okay. It came with some bay scallops, shrimp, and everything else wasn't even memorable. Very greasy (not knocking them for that though) with sub par seafood.\nThe prime rib that they have on Saturdays is completely disgusting. Do not order this! It's like imitation meat. I know it's not, but the texture is just so strange and the flavor so bland, it was bizzare. It also took forever to come out, and when it did it was cold.\nThe french onion soup here is also a total miss. They use provolone over the top. While it's a decent amount, its just too mild to be satisfying, and provolone just doesn't melt as well for French Onion Soup as a swiss does. Not stringy enough. The bread was more like a sliced white bread so it got a little bit slimy in the broth which was really really light as the onions didn't seem properly caramelized.\n\nThough they have a pool table and a patio with some fire pits, the food is so below average, the service incredibly slow, drinks not made properly... This place is definitely not worth the wait.",0.0,0.9994423985481262
