I prefer the Chandler Whole Foods because it is brighter, and more spacious but I don't really count that against the Tempe location. But what I do consider is the staff...the staff at this location is rude! This location is on my way to school so I make it work. First of all I could walk around in a circle for 40 minutes in the beauty/vitamin department and no one would even bother asking if I needed help, as they watch me walk around forever (this has happened twice already). Technically I didn't need help but it would have been nice to have the offer. The main reason I hit this place up is the juice/smoothie bar. The first time I went in I was looking for a V8-esque type vegetable juice...I didn't see anything on their menu like that so since there is a build-your-own option I asked if they could make a V8 type juice. OH MY GOD...how dare I refer to that preservative laced arsenic in a can??!?! The girl looked at me like I was nuts and responded \""I don't even know what a V8 juice is\""...oh OK, sure you don't! Anyway like I said I just usually stop in for juices because I am too lazy to make my own. I always wait at least 10 minutes just to put in the order (in the morning)...I understand it takes a while to make the juices but this is usually due to 1 or 2 people running the whole juice bar and 5 people in line. Secondly they rarely get the size right, and if they do get the size right then they get the price wrong. I've caught this 4 times and they have had to correct it. It is just a disaster but like I said it is convenient so I will probably keep going on occasion. If I want to do any grocery shopping I will just stick with the Chandler location, they seem to have better variety and it is easier to maneuver around in the store! Yes, it's expensive but that is to be expected. You can score some really good deals if you watch their ads and match their coupons with manufacturer coupons!",0.0,0.998069703578949

I ordered two different juices--The Buzz and the Toxin Flush-- because I really like fresh juice and I'd been excited to try this place. First of all, I don't get why everyone is raving about the customer service. Both times I've been in it's been standard high school kids clearly working a part-time job. I say \""clearly\"" because it's obvious they're just going through the motions; I overheard a woman ask a question about the pricing in the to-go case and the girl behind the counter sort of shrugged. And on my first visit the guy who rang me up asked, \""Do you want ice?\"" I told him no. \""Are you sure?\"" He asked. \""It's going to come out warm.\"" Now maybe they get a lot of complaints from people who aren't familiar with how juicing works so they feel obligated to ask that question, but the way he said it and his expression... It was such a turn off. Like he was warning me what I just ordered was going to be gross. \n\nBoth of those juices were fine. They tasted pretty similar to one another. I'd give each one a B. The second time I went in, the place was packed. I ordered an acai berry bowl and a Greenie juice, both to go. So the acai bowl came out about ten minutes later (all the reviews mentioning long wait times are correct) but the juice took another ten minutes. Meanwhile this frozen acai bowl is just sitting there in front of me, melting under its to-go lid. When I finally got the juice and got everything back to my car, I had a chance to taste the Greenie... And it was gross. Barely palatable. Bitter and sharp, not at all what I was expecting-- and I drink a lot of greens. The acai bowl was fine, the fruit was fresh and it all tasted good. I don't know that I need another one. \n\nUltimately I think I'll stick with The Chopshop or Whole Foods for juice. More customer service attention, faster (by far) and tastier. If you're looking for a good green juice, I recommend Chopshop's Kale Cleanse or the Chandler Garden at Whole Foods.",0.0,0.9974821209907532

Well, that's what I thought anyway. I need my veggies in the morning and was excited on this trip to see that a juice bar opened up at the Linq.

Eventually I  piece together an alternative with the limited items they did have, only to find that 2. They don't juice or squeeze anything fresh at all! 3. The employee assured us that everything gets juiced fresh every morning...as she poured the juices out of PLASTIC containers (never plastic, only glass if you must store) AND 4. One of the containers was clearly dated 3 days prior AND 5. The 'fresh' pear juice was a BROWN clumpy mess. 6. After paying $24 for 2 \""fresh\"" juices I took one sip of mine and almost vomited. Something in it was clearly rancid. That was the last straw...I asked for my money back and after 10 long minutes of fumbling she said she couldn't do that because she didn't know how. (This was a grown woman, y'all...not a young, inexperienced kid) So she offered me another drink instead! (Oy) I did her the favor of telling her how to do it....you open the cash register, take the money out and give you're very disgusted, unsatisfied customer her money back and worry later about 'how to do it'. Which she did. On the up side, my daughter thought her drink (with the brown clumpy pear juice) tasted just fine, so it wasn't a total loss. She got sick to her stomach and vomited all night that night, but that was probably COMPLETELY UNRELATED. \nIf you're looking for fresh juice on the strip, Jamba Juice now offers freshly juiced drinks and they're right inside the miracle mile shopping center at Planet Hollywood.

I wish I could remember what this was supposed to do for my body, but I'm not really all that healthy. When it's this tasty, it makes a girl give her diet a second look.\n-While I don't juice, I eat organic as much as I can. I take herbal supplements and will find a way to treat any illness with a natural cure if possible. That's the extent of my ode to a healthy life. Other than that, pass me a double cheeseburger. But again when, it's this good, it makes me want to at least juice in the morning.\n\nCon's:\n-It was pre-made in a bottle. I get it. From a time and efficiency standpoint, it makes complete sense, but I would rather watch it being made or else why not pick this up at Whole Foods. I get the shelf life and freshness piece, but do I really need to go to a storefront for only this one item and it's pre-made? Kind of disappointing.\n-$10 a bottle. I know I get what I pay for. I'm sure it takes time to create plus clean up. I'm sure it's pounds of produce, and they have to pay everyone and all of the overhead.... But $10 a bottle is high for me to grab everyday. Let's say you went most days (5-6 days a week) that would be adding about $3000 to your yearly budget on juice alone. Crazy. Goodbye, Kilimanjaro trip.\n-There's no real seating area. Take the juice, sandwich, salad and go. I like to eat what I buy right away, so I drank my juice and ate my food off of the hood of my car in the parking lot. It basically makes this place a very health convenience store. An expensive, healthy convenience store. Like a healthy, upscale 7-11 that only sells their own product.\n\nSo three stars it is because I do like the juice and the staff, but the pre-made juice at $10/bottle with no seating is something I can't quite wrap my head around.",0.0,0.9764461517333984

Overall, this place has blah combinations, too large of sizes and is a bit on the pricey side.",0.0,0.9944763779640198

I used to work close by and was excited for them to open as there aren't a ton of healthy options in the area aside from Wildflower (which is always packed during lunch). The first time I went, I tried the Southwest, which is delicious. It came in a container the size of a chinese take-out container. When they first opened, they only had smoothies. I think it confused a lot of people that their tagline was food + juice but they didn't have actual juice. I forgot which smoothie I got but remember it being kind of icey and just OK.\n\nI later went back on a hot summer day and tried their Energy juice which has pineapple, mint, coconut water, and apple. It was so good. I could probably drink that everyday. It's so light and refreshing!\n\nThis past time I decided to try their South Beach and got the Energy again. The South Beach's vinaigrette was a bit too much for me. I should have asked for it on the side. My boyfriend got the Boost juice. It was good but not very sweet. If it had apple or some other kind of sugary fruit in it, it would have been better for us. \n\nTheir prices are a little higher than similar places. However, it's because they use organic ingredients. If you're wondering if they're actually a healthy place or a fake healthy place, you can go to their website to view nutrition information. $10 for a salad is pricey for me and not something I would do frequently. If organic is important to you, paying more wouldn't be a big deal. Overall, the food and juices are great, the price tag, not so much.",1.0,0.9806364178657532

It's small so keep your eyes open for the glass door with the Grass Roots logo. \nPart of the fun was I intercepted someone else's order. I was standing at the pick up spot cooling off after a 4 mile run - yes, I'm a little crazy to be running from the strip in 92\u00b0 heat at 7:30 in the morning but I will do that for a great food(juice) experience - so I grabbed the Ginger In The Grass that Chancey handed me(Great green juice, btw. Buy this one if you want to get Your Green fix) and thought she was being nice giving me a cool drink until I order. No, it was for the guy standing beside me. Sorry brotha. \nI downed that drink pretty fast and ordered up a Matchaccino. Another great one for a pick me up with green Matcha tea, coffee beans, almond milk or coconut milk, if you prefer and some other amazing goodness. It's thicker so I felt like I had a great, healthy meal in a 24 oz cup. \nAll in all, I very highly recommend Grass Roots for the juice recipes, fresh, local produce and great, friendly customer service.

Those reviews will be posted soon.
