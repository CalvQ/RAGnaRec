You can have mundane dishes but when your service is lack luster....you'll lose me as a fan.  I've felt better served at Chic-fil-A than this place.  Sad.  We walk in, decide on the patio to eat.  Now, as most will agree when you chose to sit in a outdoor patio area, you always gamble on service.  Easy to be forgotten outside!  We were seated right away and I will interject at this point that the patio was actually impressive given the fact there is absolutely no city view, it's was still nice and probably a good spot to have a glass of wine and lounge.  There is a fairly large sofa on the patio that appeared comfy (although untested!)  Ok, back to the service issues, we sit down and that's where the service basically ended.  Hahaha...I mean it was a solid 10-15 minutes before we were even approached by our waitress.  And her first order of business was to ask if we wanted water? Why not just bring the water out, I mean my guess is 80% of people are going to want to have a glass regardless.  After our water order she said, \""What else would you like to drink\"".  I promptly responded with \""I'm really unsure considering I have no wine/specialty drink menu to look at\"".  Maybe a little forward but I have no patience for untimely service, especially if it's a place that's in a niche of restaurants that's striving to be in the upper echelon.  After drinks are delivered, we ordered our food.  During the wait for the food, the couple we were dining with noted that we had a candle on the table all be it, unlit.  ??? So my friend took care of that situation by taking a nearby table's candle in exchange for ours...hahaha....love it!  \n\nSo finally our food arrives, and it's like a shuffle game, three servers, four dishes all criss crossing each of us trying to figure out who ordered what.  I think I actually laughed out loud at this moment.  \n\nIn terms of the food, personally I had the grilled yellow fin tun (medium rare) served with baby spinach and jasmine rice.  No here, I can't complain, the tuna was fantastic, the rice was very light and the spinach was cooked to perfection.  I received another CPA (clean plate award) yay me!  \n\nSo in breaking it down:\n\nAtmosphere - 3 stars\nService - 1 star\nFood - 4 star \n\nThat's a 2.6 star average so bump it on up to 3 stars I suppose.  \n\nNote:  Right now you can get a $25 off certificate for 2 entree's for this location on Restaurant.com.  Does that make it worth it? Meh.....not IMO.",0.0,0.8727980852127075

What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was  dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter. My lamb was very good, except that lighting a rosemary twig for no purpose except to fill the room with smoke, is very unappealing and choking , especially when most diners have that dish. How is it a good idea to smoke people out? I think it takes away from he dish. Just put fresh rosemary on the plate , would be much more aromatic. The wine list is extensive and way overpriced( 300% mark up on some wines is unacceptable). I also think a water bottle should be opened at the table and not brought open to the table , makes me wonder .\nI would also note that the food plates arrived quickly( which is good) although spending $360.00 and being out of there in 90 minutes can leave one wondering what just happened.\nOverall, it is not on my return list.",0.0,0.9930673837661744

The restaurant was offering a \""summer prix fix\"" menu that allowed you to get an appetizer, an entry, and a dessert for only $40. We decided to do that but wanted to share an appetizer before. I guess our server didn't understand us, and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier.

The waiter came over and picked up my friends things and put them on the other side of me - totally made me feel hemmed in. Again, I should have asked for coat check but he should have as well. I had the restaurant.com coupon and let the server know we were using it as well as ordering from the theater menu and that we'd like glasses of wine (I like whites, my friend likes reds).

When I reached for my water glass, my chair rocked. I asked the very nice woman who showed us to our table if we could move. The lead gal was summoned and was incredibly patronized--claiming that yes, indeed, they designed the chairs to rock. Seriously? Rocking chairs in a fine dining restaurant. This isn't Cracker Barrel! After some more chatting, she very reluctantly moved us.  Our waiter was fantastic and suggested a great Italian wine that the pinot noir lovers at the table adored. Sad to say the food was just ok...my entree of triggerfish and crab ravioli didn't have much flavor and I couldn't detect a speck of crab in my ravioli.

Or by all means ask them if they have ever been to the restaurant before and by chance you won't have to explain it because your guests already know what it is.

The bartenders that I know of seem to alway recognize me and remember me and engage in small chat when busy and always check up on how everything with my time there is doing. \n\nI would've given this place a full 5 stars but the following cons of the place made it drop a star .\nEven though I been there on several occasions I still almost have to always wait more than 15 min for a spot at the bar or table near the bar. I still have to wait what seems a bit long for my burger to arrive and even then they almost always has the meat rare or even raw temperature. Normally when I get a burger that's raw I would send it back but my first time there and noticed the raw meat I had already eaten half of it. Luckily though it was still delicious and most importantly I have never gotten sick as a result of eating here but still feel the cooks can improve on that a bit. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Ramsey and I am actually even friends with some celebrity chefs that have in one form or another known or worked for Gordan directly. I am so relieved that his restaurant has made a positive impact on me, as I've been to many celebrity restaurants and only a rare few had disappointed me. \n\nNow if only BurGR had a customer loyalty reward program......\n\nThanks and I will be back soon and continue to tell all to check out BurGR.",1.0,0.984764277935028

Only place for improvement was the table area, which felt like a glorified canteen - a posh one I admit.\n\nThe array of offered food is amazing, you surely should not come without a healthy appetite. But at 19,95 for breakfast I guess nobody will do that.\nTo avoid another mistake: don't hold yourself up with bread if you want to have a salad to start with - and do take a good look around first, otherwise you might end up well filled too soon because you still keep discovering more dishes. (lol, thinking about it now 10days later makes me hungry).\n\nWas a bit disappointed with our waiter, who for every other table he worked on had more of a smile than for us - can't say what we could have done, honestly. Since I don't want to jump to conclusions I won't say more. Maybe with all the hovering around the room to get the empty plates off they get disappointed with the puny tips some folks leave... then again, disinterested demeanor is not going to change that.\n\nBut still, couldn't spoil that delicous meal we had there ! Highly recommend.\n(oh, come rather early I guess ... only because it was low season we found a table right away, I'm sure. Waiting lines in high season reported to be dozens of yards long)",0.0,0.9917205572128296

The space is gorgeous, and feels as trendy as they are shooting for.  There are catwalk \""stages\"" that go throughout the restaurant where scantily clad dancers are entertaining above you while you dine.\n\nSo why 3 stars?  Well for one, the hostesses were just a little much for me.  I should have had a reservation, I was standing there when my Host made me the reservation on the phone before we left the Hotel, but they claimed to not have received the call.  Regardless, there were clearly tables available, and yet we still had to wait an hour.  It was just annoying that they acted like they were doing me a favor and were pretty frigid each time I asked how much longer.\n\nOur server on the other hand was fantastic.  And the food was.....good.  Not amazing, but good.  An appetizer of Black Cod was well done, where I found the crab cake appetizer to be just OK.  We had a fried shrimp dish app which was also very good.  And the steaks, well it's a Morton's concept, so they were standard, solid Morton's fare.\n\nOverall fun, but with the stupid amount of great restaurants in Vegas, I doubt I would be back.",1.0,0.9921635389328004
