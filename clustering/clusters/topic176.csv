There are lots of articles in the newspapers, regular protests, petitions, etc over route reduction and fare hikes and so on. Some people think its slow, unreliable and overcrowded.\n\nThere's a general sense that its unfair that Pitt students ride for free while much of the Pitt staff do not. And, of course, the rest of the city has to pay too. \n\nBut I think all this is just a testament to the health of the system. People - students at all the college and universities, long-term residents, downtown commuters, school kids - actually value and use the bus system. \n\nIn other university towns (not to name names) the schools just give up entirely and shuttle their students around in private buses, which means, in the end, less ridership, fewer routes less frequently and less money for the public transportation. \n\nI also found the drivers to be considerate - especially of the elderly and disabled - and as helpful as they could be, given the demands on their time and attention. \n\nDepending on your living situation, the buses make it possible to live in Pittsburgh with one car, or none.  And I found that it's safer to take a bus in the snow, too, (if not quicker, which it *sometimes* also is).",0.0,0.99361389875412

Google Maps seems to have fairly up-to-date schedules to determine which buses to take to get from one location to another.  It's also free for me as a Pitt employee.  \n\nHowever, my main complaints are\n\n1. The buses are way too crowded during rush hour.  Not only are the buses almost always so full that the standing room is occupied, but bus drivers some times even have to drive by peeved people at bus stations because the bus is completely full.  \n2. Irregular intervals.  Buses have a tendency to bunch.  This some times results in having to wait at a bus station for a long time before seeing two buses together.  The lead bus is overcrowded and the second bus is usually pretty empty.  Note:  Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching\n3. Waiting outside in the cold for the bus.  Because of irregular intervals, you some times have to wait outside in Pittsburgh weather for significant time.\n\nPittsburgh needs to install GPS on their buses!  This has been implemented in Washington DC and San Francisco already.\n1.

Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.  Pitt's on the right track with their bus shelters at the Cathedral--take note.",0.0,0.9996159076690674

Your e-mail verifying my ticket said to be there an hour before the bus departed so I arrived at 4:00 p.m. and sat in your disgusting, dirty station for over an hour after I checked in. When the bus arrived, admittedly on time, the bus driver proudly announced that he only had 4 seats available, while my college bound daughter was the last person to get on the bus, but not the last person waiting for the bus, she was told she had been misinformed there were actually only three seats left. \n\nWhen I asked the bus driver what I should do about this, seeing as how she needed to be back to school in time for her classes the next morning, he pointed to the guy at the ticket counter and said, \""take it up with him\"". Excellent!\n\nThe very nice kid behind the ticket counter informed me that there was a bus leaving the Phoenix station at 11:30 p.m. and arriving in Flagstaff at 2:00 a.m.. Seriously? You want me to drive to another station and risk my daughter being dropped off in the middle of the night?!? I don't think so. So, in that case we'd just have to wait until the next bus that came on Monday at 10:45 a.m., or something close to that.\n\nJust so that I'm clear, I bought a ticket for a seat on your bus that arrived to the station without enough seats to accommodate every person who was waiting on it. \n\nWhile I was on the phone today with your customer service department I was informed that Greyhound Bus Lines works on a first come, first serve basis. Apparently buying a ticket does not guarantee you a seat until your ASS IS SITTING IN IT! So buying your ticket 3 weeks in advance and arriving an hour early at the station doesn't actually do anything unless your willing to push people out of the way to get on board.\n\nSo, thank you very much for refunding my completely useless ticket and wasting over an hour of my time waiting for a bus that couldn't accommodate my needs.\n\nI just thought you should know that the business that I had pretty much guaranteed you for the next 4 years is now gone. Exxon is thrilled.\n\nSincerely,\n\nI will never spend money with your lousy company again!",0.0,0.9981195330619812

Bought his ticket online and showed up at the Phoenix terminal this morning.\n\nHe was standing in line to get his bagged tagged and the woman in front of him was arguing with the tagger that she couldn't carry her own bag to the bus.  After a bit of back and forth, the tagger carried the bag for her, creating a few minute delay. During this time, several people without checked bags walked up to the counter, purchased tickets and boarded.  My husband finally got his bag tagged, went to board and was told nope, bus was full.  He, as well as the people behind him who had purchased advanced tickets, were not amused.\n\nThe next bus out was at 2:30AM (this was at 9AM) or they could route him a on a super scenic route that wouldn't get in until 11PM - well past when anyone could pick him up.  So, we'll try this again tomorrow, cutting his time with his family member by a day.\n\nI contacted Greyhound via FB and was told they don't have a reservation system basically it's first come, first serve, even if you're standing in line with your ticket while they sell tickets to more people.\n\nOkay, I can understand first come, first serve, but why on earth would they then sell tickets online with the date, time and bus number on them?  I'm pretty sure if my husband had missed this bus because of his error they wouldn't honor that ticket tomorrow so to me it seems like that ticket was for a seat on that bus and by issuing it, Greyhound needs to provide a seat.\n\nAm I missing something?  Because their explanation made no sense.  If it's going to be first come, first serve then the ticket I bought should be good for one fare from Phoenix to Point B on any day at any time ~ first come, first serve!\n\nWe have no choice but to go this route this time if my husband wants to see this family member he hasn't seen in years, but for future trips, I'll consider all other options ~ heck, hitchhiking might have got him there faster with less frustration (not to mention the time lost from work getting him to/from the bus station!).",0.0,0.999372661113739

However, one time, I needed to get from DC to PGH stat, and this was the only option, since the buses run every couple of hours. The Greyhound station in DC is connected to Union Station, and although it has a roof, it's outdoors. Our bus was over half an hour late, and I nearly froze while waiting for it. Finally, it pulled in, and was nice and warm, thank goodness. In terms of comfort and spacing, the seats were comparable to Megabus. Unlike Megabus, there was overhead luggage space, so I didn't have to try to squeeze my bag under the seat in front of me or ride the entire way with it at my feet, which I appreciated.\n\nOur bus made three stops in Bethesda, Baltimore, and at a travel plaza on the PA Turnpike (one further west than the Sideling Hill plaza that the Megabus stops at). I believe the trip took about 4 hrs. I have no complaints about the driver--unlike several Megabus drivers I've had, he didn't make any unreasonable demands or chew out any pax. However, a lady in front of me snapped at me for carrying on a conversation with my travel companion, even though I was trying to keep my voice down. While it was late at night (11pm), and I understand that some people would like to catch some shut-eye, I have a right to talk to my travel companion--esp. if I'm doing so quietly! For the rest of the trip, I remained awkwardly silent, so as not to incur the lady's wrath again. To her credit, she did apologize to me once we arrived in PGH, but the experience did nothing to dispel my notion of the type of people who travel via Greyhound.\n\nThe station in PGH, while not the cleanest or shiniest station around, is at least indoors, such that passengers don't have to stand around outside while awaiting their bus. This is good news, given that the passengers of many buses, such as the one I took, are required to disembark there. The chairs are hard plastic, and there are several TVs that are always on, so don't expect to get any sleep here. Having never used the bathrooms here, I can't comment on their cleanliness, but based on the rest of the station, I wouldn't expect then to be super spic and span. In addition to Greyhound, this station serves commuter buses from several townships surrounding PGH, so you may find yourself here if you ever need to take a bus to one of them.",1.0,0.9870659708976746

However, the con is that the bus was packed. The second floor as well. \n\nI got off around Planet Hollywood/Paris/Bellagio. So, I waited for the next bus, but the bus was packed again. So, I walked a couple blocks south to the other side of the United Artists theatre and found a bus that was not packed at all. The pass I had was a little weird. I wasn't sure how to insert it, but you slide the piece of card like an ATM. \n\nOverall, the bus is very crowded, but I would not like to ride it during the summer when everyone is running from the heat. $5 for a 2-hour pass is not bad, but would like it to be 24 hours and you would get more customers. \n\nHave Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",0.0,0.995210349559784

We should have purchased them ahead of time online and had them sent to us. The first ticket machine we went to accepted exact change only and would not accept credit cards. Unfortunately for me I only had small bills and large bills but did not have exact change. So we walked across the street to another bus stop and there wasn't a machine there. Walked down to another bus stop and luckily it accepted credit cards. This service is only a few years old? The ticket machines are pretty sad. They are often times unresponsive, slow, and like I previously mentioned do not always accept all forms of payment. Anyway we got our first set of passes and set out to get on a Deuce bus sitting at the stop with it's flashers on. We asked the driver if it was heading down the strip and he said no. You will have to catch the next bus. Ok. Next bus comes along 10 minutes later, he picks us up, then proceeds to sit there with his flashers on for another 10 minutes. Really?\n\nOk so we get to our destination quite a bit later than expected and wonder if we should have just gone with taxi cabs instead. Too late, we already have 40 bucks in the Deuce, we might as well use it. It wasn't all that bad really, as it did help us get around and there always seemed to be a bus stop nearby wherever we were. \n\nWe used the SDX to get to and from the marriage license bureau but other than that we rode the Deuce.\n\nI found it to be clean and comfortable for the most part, with the exception of one bus we got on that smelled like someone dropped a deuce on the Deuce. I can't blame the bus for the hygiene of it's passengers.\n\nI also found the drivers to be polite in what little interaction I had with them.

No joke.\n\nPhoenix in not a transit-friendly city, and I know that.  I'll digress for a minute.  To take a bus in a sprawling car-dependent city such as ours, most would think that you have no car, are having car problems, are poor, etc.  But in planning for the ultimate wild night out we decided to do the responsible thing and take cabs into Scottsdale.  The next morning I woke up with only $5 in my pocket.  Oops.  It could have been worse -- I could have woken up to a worse surprise. (No snickering.  That is neither here nor there.)\n\nInstead of asking friends to cart me around, the urban explorer in me decided to take the bus.  Why not?  I'm not above it.  I walked over to the bus stop at Scottsdale Fashion Square and waited, and waited.  20 minutes turned into 30.  30 turned into 40.  I called the phone number on the bus stop sign and got some automated service telling me my bus would be there in 18 minutes.  Great!!  A total of one hour.  I probably could have walked the 7 miles home in faster than an hour.   Weekday waits aren't much better.  Your hour wait will lessen to a superconvenient 30 minute wait.  Some express routes (on the freeway and a handful of major roads) run more frequently, but are few and far between.\n\nI've used many bus and rail systems, from the MTA (NY & LA) to the CTA, and BART and Muni.  And Valley Metro probably ranks below all of them. (OK, maybe not that one smelly, filthy Muni bus I rode)   \n\nI might actually ride the bus more frequently if it ran more often.  But understanding that Valley Metro probably operates under simple economics (supply and demand) I don't see them budging to run more frequently if ridership isn't there.  But guess what?  I'm not going to ride buses, if they are that inconvenient.  So there you have it.\n\nOther than that, the bus ride itself seemed to go much quicker than I thought, and wasn't as dirty as other bus systems.  Plus it was only $1.25 to ride.  Hopefully more Phoenix citizens will ride transit - I think that's the only way bus service will improve (not to mention improving traffic and air quality :-))\n\nI'm eager to see how light rail works out, but if it is as disappointing as the bus then count me out.

I am HUGE on the bus.  I've been riding it to work for 2.5 years, and am horrified that you guys aren't pushing the benefits of commuting and mass transit in this city!\n\nI love Valley Metro. I ride the Rapid bus, every day, twice a day.  The rapid shuttle is part of Valley Metro, but it is a  very different bus line then the city buses that I think some of you have been riding on. There are 4 Rapid Routes...1 from the west valley, (I-10 west from Avondale) 1 from the north (I-17 from Bell Road) 1 from the East, (I-10 East from Chandler) and 1 servicing the 51, from the 51 and Shea.  \n\nIf it were not for these rapid shuttles, I probably would not have a job, and probably have lost my mind by now. After I moved here, within 3 months, I had busted a windshield, had someone do a hit and run on me on the expressway, and basically sat in traffic for a ridiculous amt of time, so much that I was commuting an obnoxious amount of time.\n\nFinally, a fellow co-worker told me that she commutes in half the time from the same place using the bus. Since I started riding the rapid, I've been hooked.  My busses are on time, my commute is 1/3 of what I was doing when I was driving, and the amt of money I have saved on gas is unbelieveable.",0.0,0.9973516464233398

For instance, it is not currently possible for me to take the bus to work, due to the routes not covering the entire valley. Wait time is definitely an issue... even busy routes sometimes only have a bus every half hour, which is just ridiculous for planning. When I lived in Tempe, it wasn't quite as ridiculous, as the buses all went to a central \""hub,\"" and thus got me to school, work, and home, since most all were located downtown. Actually, that's not true... the bus was most useful to me when I lived in the southerly portions of the city or Mesa... the'burbs to downtown routes are quite organized and frequent. Anything else is a crapshoot in terms of convenience, or even the very existence of a reasonable route between your two locations. \n\nIt's fun to take the bus, but don't get caught behind one! Each stop typically seems take at least 1 or 2 minutes. Not enough people have metro cards, because they are (or at least were) ridiculous in price unless you ride the bus at least once each day. Then, you save a bit. Were the routes more, um, there, this would be reasonable. Anyway, this leads to lots of change counting and transfer giving. Transfers are also a crapshoot, but I think they are only supposed to last for an hour... Sometimes, you get lucky, though, and it's like an all-day pass to an amusement park. \n\nBus drivers are a different kind of animal. They are a diverse group: I've had some awesome, jolly ones (the black lady who sings while she drives, the guy that looks and acts like Santa Claus) and some disgruntled ones (the guy who stuck his head out the window and threatened to call 911 on someone who cut him off, then did, screaming into the phone in a thick accent, the guy with horn-rimmed glasses who wouldn't let me ride because I was a dime short, the guy who refused to help me figure out the bike rack, then honked at me as I fumbled with it, horn right near my face, of course). The people who ride the bus are just as interesting, depending on my mood I would get into some weird conversations (talking politics in spanish with drunk guys on the FLASH, swapping diy hair-cutting strategies with a pink-plumed art student, discussing veganism with a snobby Gentle Strength employee 'back in tha day,' being picked up on by all sorts of people). A book or walkman will grant you your solitude, if that is what you desire. \n\nWriters should definitely ride the bus.",0.0,0.9957931041717528

I am originally from Tucson and I thought Sun Tran was bad. Boy how wrong I was. I have always been an advocate for public transit and strongly support its use. However after using Valley Metro, I can see why everyone drives everywhere; its not a feasible means of transport. \n\nFirst of all the scheduling is terrible. Outside of peak hours it can be as regular as 30 to 40 minute intervals. Of course that is assuming the bus even comes! Especially on route 44, there might be several scheduled busses that simply do not show. I have regularly waited up to 50 minutes for the bus to show only to give up and call a cab or walk. In more than one instance walking proved the faster choice.\n\nDuring peak hours the buses are often crowed. Usually its not to bad as long as the ac is working. Pray that the AC doesn't go out; the smell in the busses becomes unbearable.\n\nThe drivers are rude and not very helpful. First time users beware, the drivers expect you to be expert travlers of the bus system, asking questions about payment, routes, times, transfers, or other bus transport related issues is frowned upon by drivers.\n\nIn summation: don't depend on the bus, it will probably be late if it even shows up.

I wish I made what they do! I make $9.14 an hour and I have a bachelors degree! \n\nA few situations that have pissed me off over the years involving either unreliable buses or drivers being constantly rude: \n\nRecently, I witnessed a driver yelling at an older man with a broken leg utilizing a knee scooter because it took him awhile to board the bus from the front because she was rude and wouldn't let him use the ramp. He was taking too long for her tastes. When it was time to deboard and he asked to use the ramp, she still wouldn't let him and when I asked her why she told me she didn't know he wanted to. Which is BS because he asked when he wanted to get off the bus. She would only lower the bus but it was still hard on him. \n\nI missed a job interview a week ago because my first bus was 15 minutes late, and when it finally came and I got on, the joke of a bus driver was having a conversation with the man sitting behind him. When we finally got to the bus station, he says, \""I know I'm late. hahahaha. At least I got you guys here.\"" Well what good does it do when you already missed your connecting bus and you're going to be a half hour late to your interview?\n\nAbout a year ago, I was boarding a bus and I had my ASU pass that I tap. The fare box was displaying the whole \""No smart card' message that takes a few minutes to go away. I was waiting it out and the driver started screaming at me. I calmly explained what was going on and he threatened to call police. I had my pass which showed it was valid, it was the PIECE OF SHIT farebox. \n\n\nSo, if you have a car and thinking about using public transit to save gas and for the environment, just pay the money if you can.

I prepaid and purchased his ticket online weeks ago. We got to the bus station early and we were told he couldn't ride without a notarized letter stating he could. NOWHERE on the site did I find this info, he couldn't board, and his trip was delayed a day. \n\nFast forward to today. We get to the depot at noon, which is 45 min early. Bus isn't there at 12:45 so we start calling the main office in Vegas. The idiot of a girl there answers the phone as if it's her own personal phone, doesn't even introduce herself or the company. We ask where the bus is and she puts us on hold for literally 11:30 minutes. I hang up, call back, and between her giggles she half-assed answers the phone.  After 5 minutes of holding she says \""the bus will be there at 2:10.\""  I asked why the bus is 90 minutes late and she just repeats herself. \n\nWe go home to burn some time after sitting at the depot for an hour, and come back at 1:55 and the bus is already there waiting.  The riders all look upset and the driver gets out and explains what's going on. Evidently the girl at the depot in Vegas never told him my son was on the manifest for today, so he drove through Kingman without stopping and was an hour past kingman on the way to Phoenix when she radioed and told him to come back for my son. You can imagine the anger of the passengers, all of which is now directed at my teenage son whom is - at this exact moment - riding for 3 1/2 hours to Phoenix with a bunch of angry strangers that are two hours later getting to their destination. \n\nFUCK YOU!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJason",0.0,0.9989890456199646

I was wrong. \nOn my old schedule, when I was taking the Flamingo bus to Rainbow, the Northbound Rainbow bus would come within 5-10 minutes after the Flamingo bus arrived. On my new schedule, the Rainbow bus gets to Flamingo going Northbound 5 minutes BEFORE the Flamingo bus gets there. And that's just one issue. I decided to take a closer look at my bus schedule since I only pay attention to the times when I have to catch the bus and then promptly forget afterwards. It was then I realized that the schedules for the majority of the buses are random as all hell. I guess I was pretty naive for being annoyed that most of them only run every 30 minutes, I realized that their schedules greatly fluctuate between 20-40 minutes. It's ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense.\nDetours - ENOUGH WITH THESE BLASTED DETOURS ALREADY. RTC, do you have any idea how annoying it is when I'm somewhere on Flamingo east of Rainbow, ready to go home and hop on the Flamingo bus only to see that it ends at Rainbow. WHY? Flamingo is a very major street littered with businesses and close to the homes of many, THAT DETOUR MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. And yes, this isn't the only example. \n\nAlso, there really need to be buses on Fort Apache, Hualapai, Durango and Buffalo, but that's just beating a dead horse. \n\nOn a side note, at least a mild improvement has been made recently: No more upcharge for the buses that mainly serve The Strip and other tourist areas, and the new express buses, but none of that warrants another star from me.

An embarrassment to the las Vegas metro area. They only get two stars because the Deuce on the strip is not a bad way for tourists to ride a double decker bus up and down the strip (air conditioning, generally). However, even that's really slow -- but that's not RTC fault.\n\nEverything else however is. They are a terribly dysfunctional agency who's service outside the strip is HORRENDOUS with buses routinely missing their scheduled time at least 2,3 times in a row. And this isn't due to traffic (as on the strip) its just because buses don't show up (I know because I often start at a terminus, and have waited an hour several times for a bus that is supposed to run every 15 minutes). \n\nI made the mistake of buying a 3 day bus pass in advance ($20, good deal or so it seems) for a 4 day trip. By the second day I knew I had made a horrible mistake, and there was no discussion but on the fourth day I used taxis. One of the taxi drivers (without me prompting) told me how everyone tells him the bus service is so bad and how its good for him. Personally I used to just rent a car but that's one of the few things that got a lot more expensive recently in Vegas. \n\nHowever, if you don't drink a lot I would just rent a car, otherwise, get a taxi. Don't get the bus, it will just ruin your vacation here. And for locals, it's even worse. These are people trying to get to jobs using the bus and they can only guess if they'll make it. RTC is by far the worst bus service in the country and the US has a lot of bad public bus companies. During my three days I noticed MANY fare inspectors on the buses; if RTC just instead invested in dispatchers and technology to make sure their buses run even close to schedule they would do a much better job. For a city with so many people so close by, RTC should have an easy job running buses profitably.

When I see bus coming, it doesn't stop and instead stops at the original non-evening location. I run there, see all people offloading, I am trying to board the bus and get refused.

Let the user pay - oh, but we want you to use public transit more! Those two messages don't co-exist. \n\n4. Customer service. In addition to the childish, anti-social, anti-English incidents that are all too prevalent at the STM (and really, with an anti-English government, it's to be expected, eh?) you've got a ton of \""customer service\"" employees who don't come close to understanding the meaning of \""customer service.\"" And I'm sure that their title is translated for them, so let's not blame a language barrier.

This time I'm dropping family off, instead of being dropped or picked up. It's bittersweet. Tonight the bus is sold out.. they are going to be packed in. Unloading & loading tonight is taking abnormally long. Free Wi-Fi onboard and anywhere in close proximity of the bus, so plus for that.. bathrooms onboard can be pretty minimal. Some have toilet paper and hand sanitizer and some just don't. Some smell like blue juice and some smell like a cow died in there 3 weeks ago and the carcass is rotting.  It's a pretty average experience for the price. Wish the price was lower and schedule options more diverse. Charlotte to D.C. only leaves twice daily, 1155am and 1130pm. Lately, I've been riding their competition.. several of the Chinese buses that leave throughout the city for a fraction of their price, don't have to make connections, offer the same facilities (Wi-Fi and restroom), and have more scheduling options.     .....getting back to tonight's bus, it arrived roughly 20-30 minutes ago and they are still offloading.

A question of the fatcats collecting six figures having zero goddamn clue what the transit system actually needs, since it is all theoretical for them (having never independently ridden a fucking bus in their miserable bourgeoisie lives).\n\nChange Machine\nFix it, you goddamn slimeball, worthless, barely human pedazos de mierda.

There is no way on Earth -- through any imaginable metric -- that the current contracted company can be remotely within service agreements signed by both parties. \nNote: I don't even use the change machine. \n\nTicket-issuing Machines\nThey are monumental pieces of shit. Much like the change machine, the company behind the million dollar contract to provide these piles of shit must be owned and operated by extended family of worthless RTC administrators or perhaps directly owned by them through some illegal scheme.\nNote: I don't even use the ticket machines.\n\nPark & Ride\nYeah; fuck it. There are a lot of parking stalls (in fact, too many). I am glad some creep SUV polluters use them. Very glad. Now how about some more fucking bike racks. More bike racks!\nNote: I don't use the P/R.\n\nPeda-cycle Racks\nEveryday they are full. Every fucking day. Bros, is it a complicated matter to you guys? There are bikes locked to signs up and down the outside of the building as if this were Manhattan. That is not a clue that another rack is required? For fucks sake! Idiots ....\nNote: The fucking racks, or signs, I use.  \n\nEpilogue \nCool people used to work here. None of them worked for RTC, but in any case: they made the CTC a much better place to have to stomach.

Word of advice? Book at least 50 minutes before your trip departs... as my decision was last minute, in the process of paying for the 12:30 AM trip, it disappeared from the website! \n\nPROs:\n+ This is the only overnight bus service offered... the other bus options all left after 7 AM. Megabus is the only one that arrives in LA in the morning.\n+ Professional employees, routine boarding process\n+ Timely departures and arrivals\n+ On-board outlets are very useful\n\nCONs:\n- My terminal number was not listed ANYWHERE during the purchase process, and if I had not googled, I would have missed my bus as it was all the way down and around the corner from the initial entrance\n- It was pretty loud on the bus. People were talking, playing music out loud... and this was around 3 AM. Definitely made it hard to sleep.\n- I purchased the 7:45 AM bus trip and went to the 12:30 AM departure time anyway for standby. I was told it was full, but when I complained that there was online availability, I just purchased too last minute, I was let on the bus. Kind of shady? Maybe. \n- Inconvenient location. My taxi ride costs more than the bus ticket. Other buses pick up at 3-4 different hotels along the strip.\n- Inefficient route: if it weren't for the fact I wanted to get back before 10 AM, I would have chosen one of the other bus providers. The Megabus ride took 5.25 hours, while others only take 4 to 4.5 hours. \n- A/C on upper deck was not high enough. Too many bodies, a little sweaty :l\n- Wifi doesn't really work. I've tried. Several times.\n\nTIPs:\n* I had to google to find the exact address of the South Strip Transfer Terminal that Megabus leaves from. They should provide it during check-out or confirmation of your trip! It's 6675 S. Gilespie St. \n* A taxi from the north end of the strip to the terminal costs ~$25-$30.",0.0,0.9994304776191713

No more than that. You'll be fine. Trust me. \n\n2.) There is NO place to leave your car. Local tip, leave it at Mandalay Bay and take a $10 taxi ride if you have no one to drop you off. (Not recommended. Just what some locals do.)\n\n3.) You're not on Virgin America. Don't expect the employees to greet you with enthusiasm and joy. In fact, today our greeter had quite the attitude while yelling out directions. But because it wasn't directed at me personally (I feel bad for other riders) I'm just going to say i've had those \""F@ck this job.\"" moments too. \n\n4.) The wifi is free. If you can use it.

Haha, yeah... \n\n5.) The ride itself? Not bad. While waiting in line I thought to myself \""Phew. Riding with a bunch of characters today, ok!\"" But as it turns out, my neighboring riders are hilarious to talk to. We DO have one thing in common anyway... We aren't trying to spend money on travel. \n\n6.) I'm sitting on the 2nd floor, window seat. The temp level is comfy. I can see how you could get cold if you sat in the aisle because of the vents, but it's not ridiculous. Just bring a sweater or a light blanket. The top and front of the bus has glass panels, so it's nice to be able to see everything! \n\nSo all-in-all, I give this experience a 3 star review. (Mainly because of the execution of loading.)

You guys need to fire whatever bus driver was working the 7pm bus from Vegas to LA. This guy was driving sooooo fast, that every time he hit any type of dip on the freeway, it would cause the entire bus to lurch up and practically send the passengers flying up if their seats! He was weaving in and out of traffic and coming up behind cars and trucks so fast that I thought he would run into them. We were over an hour early due to his erratic driving. I mean, I like being early. But I don't enjoy being fearful and unsafe the entire ride!!\n\nI take megabus to Vegas once a month. Only because it was about half the price of a ticket I could find on spirit airlines. First time I took it, it was $26! Not bad. Since then, it's risen (in 3 months) to about $60. Which is the price of a cheap spirit airlines ticket. Looks like airlines are the way to go! \n\nI guess it wouldn't be so bad if the employees were nicer and there wasn't threats of fights happening by customers almost every trip.

Get another job lady if your unhappy!! The others are decent or ok, one actually smiled and was polite to me today haha.  \n\nAll in all, it's not so bad. I almost always get 2 seats to myself.

I asked him what do you suggest he said come back at 3am or call customer service. So we came back at 3am and nobody was at the stop.

So I called customer service and they stated they would re-issue me a ticket for a $5.00 fee I said this was MEGA BUS fault she missed the bus! Then they said sorry lets get you over to CS at that point I wanted a refund and explained the situation that my daughters grandmother passed away and she missed the funeral. Well the lady said in this case we can give you a refund. Well today I decided not to get a refund and get another ticket and the customer service Rep didn't care what the situation she implied this was my fault and I need to send the obituary even if I just want a new ticket! I told her, but this is not the reason we missed the bus your employee turned her away at boarding! She refused the help me I told her I would file BBB complaint and she said it was nice talking to you bye! I feel mega bus pretty much stole money from me and they are refusing to return it!

If you've ridden the Megabus, it's pretty much the same thing; low-cost fares if you book early, WiFi that barely works, internet only booking, a few select, but well-travelled routes. The differences are that from Vegas, it arrives at Fremont Street, which is probably more convenient to the strip than where the Megabus arrives. The bus is a single decker instead of the ubiquitous double dockers you see on the 15. Also, there's a rewards program that gives you a free ride every eight rides. \n\nThankfully, the Bolt also seems to be comparatively less well-known and crowded; the Megabus can be sold out at busy travel times and you're forced to sit next to strange people.

Not owning a car in PGH, there are some neighborhoods that can be difficult to access, despite that I have a free bus pass and a bike.  Also, there are some times that I just want to get somewhere quickly without the hassle of waiting for a bus or cycling over.  Lyft has proven to be an excellent resource in those cases, providing me with a great transportation alternative.\n\nThe first time I used Lyft, I used it to get to a friend's house in the Wilkinsburg/Edgewood area.  Since that was my first time, I took advantage of the code on Yelp offering a free ride up to $25 (see above).  The second time, I used it to get to the Wigle Whiskey Barrelhouse in the Spring Hill neighborhood of the North Side (near Penn Brewery).  The third time, I used it to get to a restaurant on Bryant Street in Highland Park.  All three times, the rides took about 10 min. and cost $8.  Each time, a driver came within 10 min. of summoning them.  Two out of three of the drivers were very friendly and conversational--the third tried, but didn't talk as much and conversation seemed somewhat awkward and forced when he did.  None of them offered any water, snacks, etc., but then again, I don't really expect this--I'm just looking for a quick and economical ride to wherever I'm going with some friendly banter.\n\nOverall, I've had a great experience using Lyft, but I do have a couple of minor criticisms.  The first is the range of service, which encompasses the city limits and the suburbs west of the city out to the airport.  It would be great if the range could be extended to encompass some of the suburbs in other directions.  The second is the lack of a meter--or even an estimate when the destination is entered.  While fares are very reasonable and have been the same for all of my rides, it would be great to know about how much I'll be expected to pay prior to the end of the ride.\n\nDespite these criticisms, I am awarding a 5 star rating because Lyft has been significantly better and more reliable than PGH's other ground transportation alternatives (and no, I've never used Yellow Cab).  For PGH, Lyft really is as good as it gets when it comes to getting from Point A to Point B in a vehicle that I don't own and don't have to drive in an efficient and cost-effective manner.",0.0,0.912930428981781

For serious.\n\nThere's just one drawback, which I'm even loathe to mention, given my far-too-earnest desire to have you join me on my route. But alas.\n\nThe fucking bus. Won't run. On time.\n\nMaybe it's cuz I'm German as all get-out, but I expect the damn thing to approximate a schedule. And, you know, if there's a construction detour, it should take the detour consistently, or not at all. \n\nBut I'm still giving those adorable little blue buses four stars, in the hopes that you'll give it a shot. \n\nIt's not bad, I promise. Plus, I really want y'all to support some proposed service expansions, like extending the hours on weekends to midnight or even 2:00 am.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, I'm just a drunk looking for a free ride home...and some moral high ground.",1.0,0.9170662760734558

By 5pm they said the bus had been overbooked and a second bus would be needed that would depart at 6pm and would go local. Way to slump a great vacation. Not only did it NOT depart by 6 but it made all of the local stops only to not pick up any passengers. \n\nThis was an unfortunately trip from hell and I didn't make it back into NY until 2:30 am. Called customer service and they have no recollection of the overbooking.\n\nGreyhound gets a huge FAIL for ruining my travel experience. I'd expect this if i paid $40 dollars round trip Fung-Wah style but not from the big corporate monster. I hope some Greyhound executive reads this and refunds my trip. maybe I'll reconsider the rating.\n\nThis review is for Greyhound services and not the bus station.

Customer service, not so much.\n\nI had taken the Megabus to Toronto and Montreal in the past and had great experiences.  Roomier seats than expected and the outlets and wifi are a nice touch.  \n\nI loved that I could get to Pittsburgh in about 4 hours and 20 minutes with a brief stop in Erie.  There were a variety of times offered and many times I was able to have the seat next to me to myself.  \n\nOne of the problems is that the bus was coming from Toronto.  If there were any border delays, the bus could be up to an hour late.  One trip it was almost two hours!And you would get NO information from customer service.  In fact, they were often rude and disrespectful towards you.  In today's connected world there should be no reason that customer service can't be kept up to date about the status of a bus.  \n\nThe Toronto-Buffalo-Erie-Pittsburgh route no longer exists which I don't quite understand because every time I took it, it was at least 3/4 full.  The worst experience I had was when I received notificaiton my trip leaving Pittsburgh at 11:15 p.m. on a Sunday night was cancelled.  I tried calling to get additional information and was told \""it must be weather related\""  Except the trip was still two weeks away!  It turned out they had cancelled some of the trips between Buffalo and Pittsburgh (and eventually eliminated the route) but again, that is something that customer service should have been aware of.  \n\nLong story short, the bus trip itself is enjoyable and worth the price (especially since the cost of a round trip ticket is generally less than  it would cost to fill up your gas tank) but lots of luck if you actually have to deal with customer service.",1.0,0.8864718079566956
