Good times. Hence, I was looking forward to checking out the Main Meck Library Uptown. \n\nBefore you go, know that parking will likely be an issue. Your free or reduced cost parking options are: take the light rail in, check out the parking options on the library's website or pray to the parking gods that you find a spot on the street. \n\nInside, this is a decent sized library with a good amount new releases mixed in with media, DVDs and plenty of classic literature. While the staff here are very helpful and willing to help you find what you're looking for, I highly recommend searching online and putting your books on hold for easy pickup and reading! You can also choose to pickup your books at a different library branch if that works better for you. \n\nAs the other reviewers mentioned, this isn't the best spot to sit down and read through a pile of books. Regardless, I hope that this branch continues to supply the local community with great online access, helpful staff members and a boatload of interesting literature.

There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\n\nMy only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words.

Okay, the pool is drained and hasn't been in use for years--but they're hoping to convert it into a stage space.\n\nThis library is the first Carnegie library.  Like much of Braddock, this building has seen better days, but things are starting to look up again.  The ceramics studio in the basement is fully functional, with classes for children and open studio sessions for adults.  You can rent the screen printing studio, or RSVP for a spot during Saturdays' open studios. The shop also recently received a letterpress printing machine.  \n\nI'm not sure if the music hall is always open, or if it's only open for special events and tours, but it is old-fashioned and gorgeous.  I think you can peek in at the drained swimming pool during regular library hours; it's on the ground floor near the bathrooms.\n\nThe actual library stacks here seem quite small in comparison to other libraries, but the library is owned by a not-for-profit organization, and isn't part of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh system.  There's still a lot that can be done to improve this library, to help everyone really enjoy all of its features.  The five stars is for what this library can be in the future; what can I say, I'm an optimist when it comes to this building.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit, especially when a special event opens up all the different parts of the building.",1.0,0.9977152347564696

Its not very conducive to conducting the kind of research that I need to conduct. Like I said, its more of an issue with the Heard than here, but its still frustrating when the book I am looking for comes up as being housed there. I also find that they do not have some texts I would like, and I usually end up checking them out at ASU. I don't think what I study is that controversial that it shouldn't be carried in the public library of a major city. \n\nThere is one big drawback for me. Nerd Alert: I don't like the Dewey Decimal system. I'm a Library of Congress system kind of gal. Its what I've know for my entire academic career.

Libraries in general are amazing, you can learn, read, listen to music explore for hours for free and no one will bother you. This point of Phoenix pride is open, modern, and has a great selection.\n\nThe staff is really friendly and helpful in the few times I've needed them they are always easy to locate. They have several self-checkout stations, but there is alwaysa line, it would be nice if they also had a few more, or were more proactive in helping those who seem a bit confused with the machines. \n\nI love the Phoenix Library system in general. I live closest to Yucca and frequent Burton Barr, both quite frequently (more in the summer when all I want to do is laze by the pool with a book). It is so nice to be able to check books out at Burton Barr, and drop them off at Yucca on my way to work or where ever I'm headed to. They also offer interlibrary loan, so I can request books to be delivered the branches closest to me. Super convenient! They also have a really great website to facilitate this all.\n\n**My most recent and exciting discovery is the Culture Pass, which is awesome and I can't believe I haven't heard of it before! You can check out a pass to one of several of the museums or galleries in the area. You receive a slip from the librarian that you take to the site and it is good for 4 complimentary passes! It's good for a week from checkout time, and comes with other discounts you can also take advantage of. I love it! My friends and I went to Taliesen West this morning- usually $27 each for the tour we went on- completely free! This is such a great program, I really hope that it continues even with budget cuts.\n\nIt's a big, beautiful library, plus it's open on Sunday. You can't beat that!",1.0,0.9992634654045104

Walk past the reflection pool, heading south and you'll find an extensive children's section.  It served as a perfect and *free* place for our small party of toddlers to kill some time.  There is a low, curved bench with cubbies full of books which piqued our girl's interest.  The bench seat had various art embedded into it, providing it texture.  Another great part of the kid's section is the large, dark blue felt feature on the wall.  Several small, bright & colorful pieces of felt in the shape of familiar cats & fish and the unfamiliar coyotes can be be placed at will.  This is an idea I'll definitely steal! \n\nThere is an adjoining courtyard next to that section.  It is enclosed with a curving tall fence, part of which is made with colorful sections of purple, blue, red, etc.  We weren't able to access it because they closed it due to mud.\n\nMinus a star because the main info desk and the kid's info desk couldn't help us find what we were looking for (a park just due west of the library), but that is minor.",0.0,0.8192037343978882

I've heard wonderful things about all that the library has to offer for adults but I really only use libraries to check out books for my classroom.  \n\nThroughout my 6.5 years of teaching, I have acquired over 1100 children's books of my own.  Aside from the fact that I love children's books one of the main reasons I choose to buy books for my room rather than check them out is because the library is just so difficult to rely on when it comes to getting the books I need.\n\nI teach small children, so I am fully aware of how hard it is to keep things organized if kids are allowed to touch them.  But isn't the point of the Dewey decimal system lost if books are NEVER organized back to their rightful places on the shelves?  Every time I try to check out books from Burton Barr I have to spend hours looking for them.  The computer says they're checked in, but guess what - they're never where they're supposed to be.  I get that there are budget cuts and not as many librarians as we most certainly need in such a large section, but come on.  Stop worrying about the kids who want to play on the computers and start organizing the shelves!  According to the online system, the library has a wonderful collection of books to entice children off the computers and into the world of reading, so why isn't it more important to put those books in their hands and make them easy for people to find?\n\nBack in the day, I used to load up my class and head to the library for our first field trip of the year.  They made sure every kid was signed up for a library card before we went so they could all leave with a book.  I was always disappointed when we'd show up and sit through a puppet show instead of learning about how to use the library or why they should even bother asking their parents to bring them back.  Perhaps if they'd spent years teaching the children who visited how to use the library rather than entertaining them with a puppet show the shelves would not always be in the sad state they are today.",0.0,0.995594561100006

Sadly, when we got there the library was undergoing major construction and the book sale was reduced to the size of a closet. We each only found one book.

What's nice about the Clark County library system is that if your home library doesn't have the book you're looking for (which is about seven times out of ten for Sunrise) you can request it online and it'll be delivered to your home library when it's available. At Sunrise, when your book has arrived, you can get it off the hold-shelf yourself and the check-out process is now all self-serve and electronic. I'm pretty sure it's like that at all Clark COunty libraries now, but really loving this feature at Sunrise because their staff is small (but friendly for the most part) and the line could get pretty backed up. Staff is available for those who aren't self-sufficient or are technologically challenged.\n\nThis is a very child-friendly library with a great children's and young adult section and they often have small group activities and show children's movies here. Schedules can be found online and you can get on the mailing list to get a quarterly newsletter/events calendar for all Clark County events, book clubs, etc. There's also a small art gallery that changes, I believe, quarterly. Nothing's ever struck my interest, however if you're in the area and looking to check out some art, you can pop by Sunrise and take a look at the spread there. \n\nYou can't control the patrons of the establishments you go to, so my only comments on this are, look at the neighborhood, assess and have your mind right and ready when you go here because there are some characters whether they be obnoxious high schoolers there to do anything but check out books and/or study or the elderly man who can't figure out the self-checkout process and verbally assaults the staff member trying to assist him.  \n\nOverall, a decent library with a moderate selection with nice staff and has finally caught up to the 21st with modern check out processes.",1.0,0.9804590940475464

It does not touch on the theater, events, or library district.  \n\n  This Main Library Branch falls short of my expectations for a respectable main library branch. And secondary library branch for that matter. \n\n   These days the Main Library Branch appears more like a mental hospital annex than a library. Inside and outside the library, homeless people loiter to the point that some are using it as a Motel 6. The drug and alcohol epidemic is the constant exhibit. The restrooms are repulsive. The incapable security guards are totally dysfunctional. For example, earlier, a mentally ill man was raging at a librarian for waking him up. I am appalled at how slow the security guard handled the disturbance. Ineffective security also creates an intimidating environment to walk outside the building. Libraries, especially the main branch are supposed to be symbols of civic pride; this one is a symbol of the effects of drug use and alcoholism.\n\n  Comparable to some of  the Clark County Library branches, the Main Branch instock is the very image of a Border's \""Going Out of Business Sale\"". On account of a new Clark County Library policy, patrons are allowed endless renewals. The consequence is that some of the library patrons bookshelf collection is growing while the library' s collection is becoming bare.\n\n  Comparable to all the Clark County Library branches, the hours of operation are absurd, yet better than the Henderson Library District. It is unacceptable to close at 7 P.M. weekdays and 5 P.M. on weekends. Especially when a large percentage of patrons leave work after 4 P.M.\n\n  In my most honest opinion, the Main Branch fails to inspire people to develop a reading habit.

As this library is right up my alley, I love coming here to both browse and read, and while it isn't a good as UNLV's Lied Library back when I was a student, it's still a very solid and nice library.\n\nFor starters, the actual \""library\"" is just part of the facility itself.  There is a used bookstore, meeting halls and they occasionally have (albeit small\"" art exhibits.  The place is very large for a Clark County library.\n\nThey have not just a wide selection of books, but also of other multimedia like music and film.  Way back when, the only kinds of movies you could find would either be very old classics or documentaries, now you can find anything from blockbuster films to pro wrestling DVDs (yes, you read that right).  \n\nWhen I first started coming here in middle school, they had a physical circulation desk.  Now, everything is automated.  This can be a good or bad thing based on your personal preferences, but it's a good display of evolving the library.  There are quite a few study rooms for when you are cramming for exams, and there are several good reading areas that are relatively secluded from the high traffic walkways.  This is where I usually go when I want to do some reading outside of my house, and there are few things more relaxing than going here and plunging into a good book with some jazz on my iPod.  \n\nUnfortunately, due to the recession and cuts to public institutions, the library has severely cut their hours.  It used to be open until 9 Monday through Thursday, now it's until 6.  By comparison, UNLV's Lied Library is open until midnight Mon-Thurs, so I am a bit spoiled by it back when I was a student.

I'm one of those dudes that cannot work from home due to the distractions at home (i.e. TV, Bed, and the Fridge).

I guess I'm use to the Centennial location where there's not too many people there and also my phone use isn't frowned upon.  But I get it.

The YPL has a lot of resources for the kids and my daughter loves the board books and puzzle areas. \n\nThe reason why it's not getting 5 stars is because the circulation desk needs to provide better customer service. I used to volunteer at this library over 15 years ago until I actually got a job at another library and I know customer service was a biggie. I was carrying a bunch of books and my toddler. They have self check kiosks and I was able to check out some of the books but not all. I tried scanning the bar codes and it just wasn't working. I picked everything up and headed to the circulation desk. I explained my problem as I was struggling carrying all of this stuff. The circulation assistant told me to ask the lady by the kiosks (there was no lady when I was checking out) and that board books need to be scanned in. Really? Because I TRIED it multiple times and I know how it works since I used to work for the library even though it was like 12 years ago. She didn't even help me at all and didn't bother helping me check out. I went back to the self check kiosk and used a different machine and it worked  (found out another person using my old machine had the same issue!). In the end I felt she could have just checked out my 3 board books and I could have been on my way instead of sending me back to where it wouldn't work. I just thought she was the most unhelpful person ever when she saw me struggling carrying my child and all the books. \n\nBUT back to the positives. Love the story times here and I have had to ask the reference desk for help a couple times and they've always been great. They showed me how to get more reference material online from their web page which was pretty nifty. Overall this library rocks and I am a regular!,0.0,0.7882386445999146

Windmill Library is indeed a library with a lot of books and from the outside, you'd think the LIBRARY would be massive inside, but it's actually only in the left side of the building. Don't park on the right side of the parking lot because you'll end up making quite the trek just to get to the library section. The library is only one story (who knows what goes on upstairs) which contains children as well as adult literature. Perks of the library would be that they're close to my house, and they have a better selection of DVDs & random paperbacks for children, especially pertaining to superheroes. \n\nThe following lists the reasons why I still drive 20 minutes to Sahara West (SW from now on):\n1. The librarians, security guards (not because my children are terrible, but because one of them thinks my son is extraordinarily cool), and women at the circ desk all know my children. I never see the librarians at Windmill Library talk to anyone or do anything fun.\n2. The set up is no bueno for wandering children, because as soon as they walk 2 feet past the children's CD, they'll find a bunch of old people sitting there reading adult books. SW is completely separated by the Young Adult section & there are no serious reading adults for at least 20 yards. \n3. Storytime gets full? What? I have never been denied out of storytime at SW (we go every week), but the room here is so small, it reaches capacity fast. Weird. They should reconfigure the useless space upstairs & do storytime there! Problem solved.\n4. Adult paperbacks are kind of a mess. They're separated by topic, but not alphabetized (SW's is!). Once, I was desperately looking for a book & was open to a paperback version so I called the library when they opened to see if a librarian could check for me. She told me that she doesn't have time to do that and I have to come see myself because they're all over the place. I asked, \""none of your stuff is alphabetized?\"" & she said, \""yes, it's like a treasure hunt\"". Hmm.... Apparently, even the librarians there think it sucks.... so much so that she doesn't want to get out of her chair & do her job. \n\nIf you're a parent who's used to going to Windmill, check out Sahara West.

I haven't really been to many but compared to what this library used to look like before the expansion and compared to what I'm used to seeing back home, the Champaign Public Library is pretty cool.  \n\nMy favorite things about this library are:\n- Plenty of seating.  There are lots of open couches to sit on and read or tables to work on.  There are even quiet rooms if you need the extra silence.\n- The children's area.  I bring my son with me most of the time and he enjoys playing with the toys in there.  I'm still trying to get him interested in the actual books though.  They also have story time in a separate room there.  The rainbow lights of the librarian's desk also entertain my son.\n- The checkout area.  It's electronic and fully automated so that all you have to do is stick your library card in the slot, stack your books on the rubber pad, and get a receipt of what you checked out.  I've never seen anything like it.  What's comforting is that there are still some clerks at the checkout desk so that if you're like me and can't quite figure it out on your first try right there to help you.\n- The outside book return.  It's so simple and fun to watch (or maybe I'm just easily entertained...LOL!)  It's not right in front of the entrance, it's on the opposite side of the building, but that makes it easier to return your stuff because all you have to do is drive around to the other side.  You don't have to park or get out of your car.  You just drive up and hold your book up to the return slot and it opens automatically.  Then you just put your things on the conveyor belt and the slot closes and you're done.  Easy!",1.0,0.992958664894104

It is a great resource for Ahwatukee. It's clean, has free wifi and plenty of popular items, and is a great place to get out of the heat during the summer for any number of people.\n\nSince they're part of the Phoenix library system, they have access to great services like the Overdrive catalog. Go online and log in with your library card to check out audiobooks and ebooks! You can check out 10 at a time. There are also plenty of great community programs like the Culture Passes mentioned in another review.\n\nThe one downside is that the staff is pretty unhelpful (and sometimes unfriendly). I've had my daughter ask for a book because it was listed as being on the shelf but it wasn't in its place. I don't need a staff member to walk over to the shelf, look at the empty spot, and then shrug, saying it must be lost. I could discern that myself. Some of the ladies working behind the counter (I don't know what their function is) are downright unfriendly and sullen. Retire and let some newer blood in, if you hate your job that much.\n\nIgnore the staff and you'll be golden.",1.0,0.5106558799743652
