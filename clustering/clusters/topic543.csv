Unfortunately, her P.I. case was not handled well, partly due to the fact that these guys were not well versed in those types of cases. Instead of referring her elsewhere, to an attorney better suited to her type of case, they took her case and almost ruined it. She was \""stuck\"" with Platt by then, and could not afford to get another attorney.\n\nIn my opinion, taking a case when it is not in the best interest of a client, ie. that is not your specialty, is not professional. She should have been informed during consultation that this was not their area of expertise. I really believe had she had a better attorney she would have gotten a settlement that matched her permanent injury.\n\nBut that is just my opinion, and this is Yelp.",0.0,0.9996123909950256

We have mentioned this to them on each occasion, with no resolution to the issue.  Howard (the manager) is, to say the least, inconsiderate, rude, dishonest, demeaning, and not knowledgable.  We just could not trust him and had several bad encounters with him - displaying the above.  The system that they have is from the 1990's, maybe even the 1980's and need to be updated to at least a 21st century security sytem.
