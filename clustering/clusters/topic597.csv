Be careful, though, produce and organic/natural items can be more pricey than Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.\n\n#1 rule:  bring loads of PATIENCE.  I am currently unemployed, and as such have visited this store at all hours on all days:  It is ALWAYS busy.  If you are driving, be mentally prepared not to find a spot in their parking lot or two levels of parking garage.

Back in the day it was the grocery store that was different.  Fresher, you know?  \n\nNow with the other grocery stores doing what they have to gain marketshare, this location and maybe the entire store seem a bit dated IMO.  I went in to buy flowers since they have always had a great selection and good pricing.  Since it's been a while I waled through.\n\nI have grown to like the wide aisles and big selection of the other stores.  Fresh Market just seems crowded and walking around there isn't a real flow.  The meat counter was understaffed although there was a nice selection.  Walking up and down the aisles there was some pretty good stuff and I found what I wanted.  Cashiers were friendly and the experience was good.  The \""buggys\"" were the older metal kind and were dated and rusty.  Definitely time for an upgrade.\n\nWe all know that in Charlotte we have plenty of grocery stores so you're not stuck to one location or one store because surely there is a Harris Teeter on the next corner from wherever you are.  Fresh Market used to set the bar, now it seems like they need to catch up.",0.0,0.9341191053390504

It's newer, with spacious aisles, and very clean. The layout of the store is almost exactly the same as the layout of my hometown Bashas' in Lake Havasu. Having the same layout is even more exciting since I know where everything is! It's all about comfort here. It has a great bakery, deli, and even a burrito station. (I love Bashas' buttercream frosting. It's better than most of the grocery stores I've been to.) The meat department and produce is great as well. I love coming here for a quick shopping trip during the week or on the weekend for my stock-up trip.

It's a lot bigger than I expected; it also feels bigger than Pinkus McBride Market on Hamilton (see previous yelp review) but not sure if the actual square footage would back me up there. \n\nMarket Basket is the little grocery store I was looking for -- larger selection and options per item. Milk, bread, cheese, juice, snack foods, frozen pizza, basic cooking items such as olive oil, pastas, beer, and toiletry needs were all available. There was a small coffee bar, too. I was happy that they stocked Malt-O-Meal brand cheap cereal, though it was in a box rather than a bag. \n\nOverall, I would say one could do with shopping at Market Basket full-time. It'd be very monotonous eating as well as expensive but when time is money, it's the perfect nearby grocery stop. I give an \""A-OK\"" rating for the fact that in a crunch, I would go there over Pinkus for my grocery needs. But the service was tart, on the edge of annoyance. And I was just paying for my food - pretty standard stuff. \n\nIn compliance with other yelpers' reviews, I didn't feel comfortable. It was as if I was unwelcome and intruding. I care about where I spend my hard earned money, and honestly, there were no good vibes or spectacular prices to keep me going back on a somewhat regular basis. \""Meh. I've experienced better\"" reflects my overall opinion.",0.0,0.9991857409477234

So much bigger and cleaner and organized. This is the BEST place in the city to get your groceries (whether at the downtown location on Fort or at the Parc location). \n\nSuper affordable food, HUUUUUUUGE selection, and really cheap delivery! Finding this place is really a lifesaver if you use public transport only. Never carry groceries home again! The delivery is really reliable, too - if you don't get your groceries within an hour or two (which is unusual), you can just call them up and see what's what. They're very friendly and helpful. The only time our grocery delivery was late was because the poor delivery guy's car broke down. We gave him an extra tip that night. \n\nHonestly, Montreal has really cheap food in general, but PA takes the cake - you will never spend so little on groceries and get so much goodness. They have health foods, ethnic foods, tons of great produce, lots of local options, fresh baked breads, and I could go on and on and on. \n\nAnytime I've ventured to another grocery because I thought that since it was a little closer, it might be easier, I was disappointed either with the price point or the selection or the quality of goods.
