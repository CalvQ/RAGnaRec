The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  \n\nOne of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  \n\nEveryone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.\n\nAll in all, a great experience.

I think this place fits the bill! \n\nI got the cayman which is a combo of two of their items. I got the Fiji and Singapore curry. Fiji is like slow cooked chuck roast in teriyaki sauce, good but still a little tough. Singapore curry had chicken and carrots in like a Japanese curry (like the cubes you buy at the asian market) but with a hint of sourness. The meat (chicken) was stringy because it was also slow cooked, a texture I didn't care for.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal and serving size was good, I couldn't finish my bowl.Price was cheap, 5 bucks! Even less if you get one item. I appreciate their unique menu, away from the typical chicken or beef drenched in teriyaki sauce, but its nothing mind blowing.

A-OK is the perfect term to describe Samurai Sam's.\n\nYou can find your typical teriyaki bowl here. Good amount of veggies. Not too overbearing on the rice. Toppings include beef, shrimp, salmon and chicken. The nice thing about this place is that you can pick dark meat or light meat chicken. Their teriyaki sauce isn't too overbearing or sweet. It's quite light and flavorful enough that you can taste the other ingredients in the bowl. \n\nYakisoba bowls are also an option here. If you're a noodle person, this is for you! Yakisoba is a dish that can get easily salty when the sauce is reduced down while cooking. The yakisoba here isn't too salty or greasy. It's quite alright. You can add the toppings mentioned above in your yakisoba bowl. \n\nWhat I really appreciate about this place is the choice of white steamed rice or brown rice. This Samurai Sam's is located right across the street from LVAC and I'm sure health nuts will appreciate this.\n\nThe regular bowls are decent sized. Enough for a healthy meal after a work out. If you're hungry and need something more than that, they do offer \""sumo\"" sized bowls. These are HUGE. I've gotten the sumo bowl before and I wasn't able to finish it in one sitting. \n\nSamurai Sam's always has Groupon deals going on. For what it is, I feel as though they Samurai Sam's is a little overpriced. But their Groupon deals makes this place way affordable (it's usually $6 for $12 worth). So keep an eye out for that!

You just walk up to the counter, give your name, your order, pay and go sit down.  I got the chicken breast teriyaki bowl.  This comes with LOTS of chicken, steamed white rice and teriyaki sauce.   That's it.  I also picked up a bottle of Powerade Option, the availability of which was a pleasant surprise.  The total came to just over 8 bucks.  There was also the minor annoyance of a 35-cent surcharge to use my debit card.\n\nAfter waiting what seemed like nearly 10 minutes for my order, I finally got a chance to eat.  First of all, they put next to no teriyaki sauce on my bowl.  Just barely enough to dampen the chicken.  I actually had to use soy sauce later on with my remaining rice the teriyaki was so scarce.  The chicken seemed genuinely cooked as the exterior was downright crispy during some bites.  But once you got down to business, it was quite rubbery.  Not good.\n\nOdds and ends:  The place is relatively small.  Just a few tables surrounded by barstool/wall counter seating.  Plenty of reading material such as the Las Vegas Weekly to keep your mind occupied as the food is cooked.  Oh, and big ups to selling Powerade Option.  A con that's certainly not exclusive to Teriyaki Madness is those debit card receipts that ask you to put down a tip.  I feel guilty not giving one, even though it's for service that doesn't deserve it.  But I digress.\n\nAll in all, I'm sticking to Samurai Sam's for my teriyaki fix.

One of many things I'm an expert at is chicken teriyaki and Teriyaki Madness makes good ones. Choose your meat/protein: I had chicken (dark). Choose a base: I had white rice.

The other base options are brown rice, fried rice, veggies or noodles.\n\nService was friendly & it didnt take too long considering how busy they were during the Saturday lunch rush when I was there. They ask for your name when you order so just listen for it to be called. I ordered to eat in but was still given a nice, sturdy bowl worthy of take-out. It was the nice plastic kind with a snap lid.

The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.\n\nSo I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.

So when I saw this new location near home, nothing pushed me to go right away. But then one evening, I reaaaaaaaally wanted a teriyaki bowl. Since there aren't many options, I decided to give Yogi's another shot. This time, I was impressed! It does sometimes take a little time for your order to be ready, but I'm sure that's because everything is being made fresh, so I don't mind. \n\nThe teriyaki chicken is tender and fairly lean, the rice is perfect and the sauce is great. The only thing I don't like is the sliced scallions they garnish with. I usually don't like raw onions of any sort. I'm a quasi sushi fan, and all the rolls I've had have been great.

I think it should be a food group unto itself. It certainly would merit it in my case, as it's part of my food pyramid. For me, it goes (starting from the bottom): steak, burgers, pizza, teriyaki, sushi. That's the pyramid, and teriyaki is in a good spot, I think. Having said that, why just the three stars? Well...\n\nBecause this place is right outside the LVAC I (sometimes) go to, I only ever come here after a workout when I'm starving and don't feel like paying $7 for a smoothie. Every single time I've come in here, I've ordered the same thing: yaki soba with teriyaki beef and veggies, sauce on the side. I have no idea what anything else tastes like, but keep in mind I feel this makes me an expert on this particular dish. So this review is pretty much based on that one dish, plus the one time my brother said he ate there and he liked it. \n\nUltimately, it comes down to the noodles on this dish. The steak is almost always great, as are the veggies (but I hope you like a ton of broccoli and not enough anything else...) but the noodles are not the best. They always taste the way Panda Express chow mein tastes after I've left it sitting out for a few hours and then get back to it between episodes of Arrested Development. It doesn't taste fresh, but it's not that bad. It tastes like three stars. It tastes like \""I come here because it's the best choice without having to move my car\"" or \""man I am starving and this is better than getting KFC on the way home.\""\n\nWhile I come back?

I love that you can customize your bowl and they have a variety of different options including some Hawaiian dishes. It's always clean and smells good in the restaurant in the bathrooms believe it or not look great. That's a very important thing! What that tells me is that they do not only pay great attention to their food, but they also pay a lot of attention to the ancillary things that other restaurants let go. After the gym this is a protein in carb pack power lunch. Great for energy and increasing your metabolism! I highly recommend it especially for health goers.
