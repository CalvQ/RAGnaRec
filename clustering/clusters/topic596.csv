Once for lunch on a Sunday and once for dinner on a Saturday.\n\nWhen I was there on Sunday, I felt like I wasn't trendy enough to be eating there.  The diners around me were all dressed to the nines and seemed like they were trying to outdo each other in the amount of designer gear they were wearing and stories about their adventures from the night before.  We were seated right away and seemed to have just beat the rush as about a half an hour later, every single table was packed.  Our food was good but nothing to write home about.  Service was decent but not the best.\n\nThe second time I went with a part of four around 5:30 on a Saturday evening.  Once again it appeared we just early enough to beat the dinner rush.  The vegetarian appetizer was tasty but filling.  I almost didn't have room for my entree. \n\nI ordered the \""honeymoon\"" juice which featured carrots, cucumber and grapes.  The strongest flavor was the cucumber which was fine by me since it is one of my favorite vegetables.\n\nMy entree was the jasmine rice with beef.  It was flavorful and the beef was tender although I preferred the taste after I added the hot sauce that was provided on the side.  \n\nService was pretty good and drinks were quickly refilled.  My complaint from this visit was that it was really hot in the restaurant.   It was 90+ degrees that day, but it felt like the air conditioning wasn't on (or if it was, it wasn't working properly).  By the end of our meal, it seemed as if it had finally kicked on.\n\nOverall, the food was decent and I had an enjoyable experience but I'll probably try other places in the area before I return to Alladin's again.",0.0,0.5794579982757568

There has to be something said about doing simple things well, and Chipotle excels here.  Their menu and ingredients are simple and not too complex.  Sure, you may not get a variety, but at least they know what they are doing as far as what they do provide.  \n\nMy usual go to is a chicken bowl, white rice, pinto beans, chicken, medium salsa, corn, guacamole, and lettuce.  When they are out of guac, I usually go the cheese route... but you can't go wrong.\n\nDepending on if there is a line, (usually there is) you can get your food and be eating within 5min which is great.\n\nThis location has parking in the back - off of a busy South Blvd, I'm sure they are not hurting for business with all the other shops around this location.

After walking by the Dose several times in the last year, I've finally had a chance to visit a handful of times and I'm adding this to my list of weekend afternoon or happy hour stops. \n\nI first visited for happy hour. I was pleased to learn that domestic beers were just $2 and they served them in ice cold glasses. Now for those who know me, they know that I don't typically drink beer from a glass. Not sure why, but there's just something about drinking out of a bottle. But, in the case of the Daily Dose, I went with the glass this time because it was so cold it chilled the beer to perfection. After reading so many reviews about the Daily Dose burger, I had to give it a try. Not bad burger lovers. The pretzel bun added to the taste and the burger was solid. The fries were OK. I had the combo but preferred the regular fries to the sweet potato ones. One thing that surprised our group was that the restaurant does last call at 9 on the weekdays, so we noted that this isn't your choice for making it a late night. \n\nThe second time I visited, my friend and I split the citrus avocado salad with cilantro lime dressing and the shaved turkey melt with brie. I really liked the unique kick to the salad due to the combo of fruit and avocado. It was a refreshing bed of greens. The turkey melt was a combination of brie, jalapenos and chipotle mayo on sourdough bread. It's a great sandwich if you're in the mood to consume some cheesy calories. \n\nBoth times, I've enjoyed the food and will definitely remember the Daily Dose when my tummy starts growling again.",1.0,0.9981589913368224

We also ordered a side of garlic fries which were really yummy. I found the rest of the menu a bit limited and would have probably rather tried the lunch offerings but we missed the service time for that.\n\nTip: if the pudding menu doesn't tickle your fancy head down the road to the Vittoria* Gelato/Ice cream window\n*Thanks to Jenny L. for the reminder on name of the place =),1.0,0.9589424729347228

I ordered the french dip, and it was good, not a whole ton of meat inside the big, big, bun.  My co-worker had a burger and it looked really good, and was quite large also, she took home half.  Our chef ordered the pastrimi on pretzel bread and said it was quite tasty, and another co-worker had their version of the cuban sandwich.  Again, everything was good, not blow me away, but good.  However, I do love the decor, and they have this huge beautiful big chandelier hanging.  The chairs and seating areas are all kind of mismatched and funky, but it works.

For the entrees, Gyro Plate, Lamb Soulvaki, and Moussaka, were ordered. My Moussaka was KICK ASS and completely put that swill from My Big Fat Greek to shame. The Lamb Soulvaki was juicy, and tender, and dad seemed to enjoy his giant plate of Gyro meat. All of these are served with fresh grilled pita wedges too, and rang in just below $10 each. SO MUCH FOOD, for the price. Finally the two staff members I encountered were SO NICE, helpful, cheerful, and very willing to accommodate customers.
