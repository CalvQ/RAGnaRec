But if you want the real-deal kind of Asian food, Fugu is the one. Normally, I wouldn't suggest going to other places, but Chin's is such a rip-off compared to other places.\n\nHowever, I will say this: Chin's has a very neat ambiance and the setting itself is much nicer than any of the other Asian food places on or near State St.",0.0,0.9985628724098206
