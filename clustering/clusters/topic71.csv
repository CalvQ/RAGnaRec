Yes, I know the sides are served separately so that limits how the dish might be displayed, but more could have been done to appeal to the eye.  \n\nAll in all, the food was adequate (except the delicious fondue!).

My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \""small plates\"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\"" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service.

He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.\n\nI finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).\n\nWe finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment.

First of all, on a Saturday night, the place was dead.  That should tell you something.  The next clue would be the extremely worn out chairs.  Nearly every bit of paint has been worn off the chair frames.  Don't get me started on the floors and the walls overflowing with tacky pictures.  \n\nService is not their strong suit. It took forever to get our order taken and even much longer to actually get some food. Nothing in this place is made fresh.  The dinner salads were even too small for a child and consisted of wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple chunks of tomato, drowned in bottle dressing.  My parents ordered the simplest meal normally you cannot screw up, spaghetti and meat balls.  First the sauce was not a red I recognize but almost black.  It appeared to have come straight out of a Hunts can, most likely from the dented can bin at the local grocery store.  The noodles where uninspired and had no flavor.  \n\nI ordered the fish and fries.  First of all, who puts fish on the menu but does not offer cole slaw?  How dare you!  My fish finally arrived at the table 20 minutes after the spaghetti giving the appearance that they had to run down the street to the local mega mart to buy some.  The flavor was not bad, just nothing to brag about.  Dry, overcooked and about half the size of a normal portion.  The tarter sauce was pre-proportioned from a jar and the color showed it had been around awhile. \n\nTopping it all off, the owner after nearly 20 years in business has yet to figure out how to program his cash register.  He has to ring up dinners under the sandwhich button and fish under the pizza button.  The worst part, this means the prices don't match what is printed on the menu!  In order to get close to the correct price for our meal they had to leave off one of our appetizers.\n\nThis place has truly gone down hill, if it ever had a chance in the past of being anything more than a dive bar serving horrible bar food.",0.0,0.9997350573539734

At first glance, the meal didn't look too good so instead of digging in I decided to dissect it. There were 34 mushrooms in my lunch-sized meal, along with 5 pieces of chicken...and not the round chucks of chicken either. There were 5 slithers of chicken that were equilavent to or smaller than the cashew nuts. No joke. Maybe today was an off day for Cherry Blossom. Idk.

After seeing all the great reviews, I had been wanting to try this place for some time. With so many 5 star reviews and a number of people on here raving about the freshness and quality of the food, I had high hopes. Unfortunately Alessia's didn't live up to the hype. The service was very slow, which I won't hold against them. Most people were sipping wine, so maybe it's their intention to slow it down a bit. The bread is garbage. Probably the worst part of my night there. It tasted like they went across the street to Basha's and bought some rolls that they heated up in the microwave. A good Italian restaurant has to have good bread. The rest of our meal didn't get much better. The pasta we ordered was disappointing. Small portions, small taste, big cost. Definitely not worth the price we paid or the time we waited. The reviews I read did not describe the food I ate. I understand if you love Alessia's for the atmosphere, the wine or maybe because it's hard to find a place like this in Mesa, but the food I ate did not deserve 4.5 stars. It was bad enough that I have no intention of giving Alessia's a second chance. Not the worst I've ever had, just the most disappointing. One last gripe I have is the service.

We ended up having lunch at the restaurant Elements.  Great table with a wonderful view, attentive service, but the food was a complete disappointment.

I also ordered the lobster bisque and, although it had a seafood taste to it, I couldn't find a single piece of lobster in it.   They make a presentation of delivering the bowl with an assortment of minced items in it, to which they then ladle the cream over.   Perhaps it was just because it was minced so small, but I couldn't find a single piece that had the texture and taste of lobster.

This was not my first time to this location, but perhaps over a year since i have dined at Red Lobster. I just remember the amazing cheddar bay biscuits they bring freshly baked to the table. It was the best part of the meal here, always. I could eat the whole basket right when they bring it out and sometimes I do and then get too full to eat an entree.\n\nThe reason we chose Red Lobster for our early dinner was because there was an ad in the mail for $29.99 for 2 people to dine - 2 salads, 2 entrees, and choice of appetizer or desssert. As great as it sounded, I knew there would be a catch but we went anyways as I had been craving the biscuits. After waiting about 10 minutes to be seated, when it wasn't even busy... I was so disappointed with the deal. I knew the entees would be limited, but so were the desserts and appetizers, to only 3 choices of each. We also had a coupon with the ad that is $4 off two dinners, and the server said we could've used it with the $29.99 offer.\n\nBut I really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos. So that's what we ended up doing, lobster nachos and shrimp scampi to share. Pictures will be posted. The first 3 bites of each item was great! But that was about it. Then the nachos were soggy and there wasn't much lobster, and then the scampi was filled with small shrimps, but after about 3 bites I felt sick.\n\nThe server was very nice though. But I completely agree with the current rating of this restaurant, about 2.5 stars. Not worth the price for what you get. There's so many better quality or better value restaurants.\n\nI'll just have to learn to make the cheddar biscuits myself!

I don't eat meat but it's usually not hard for me to order something without meat and still enjoy/fill me up especially at an Asian restaurant. I couldn't really find anything on the menu so I just ended up ordering \""Goldilocks style spaghetti\"" not really expecting to it be any different. I asked for no meat in my sauce and the waiter told me it would be ok. I also asked about the boba and he didn't tell me the flavors, he said they have a purple and green kind. I understand this is an Asian restaurant and it's hard to communicate with costumers but I am familiar with Boba in the first place so he could just said the flavors instead of colors, I'm not stupid. After waiting around for 15 minutes for the boba it still didn't come out. So I asked another waitress (the waiter who helped me wasn't around) explaining the boba I got and was just wondering where it was. She replied with, \""I don't know\"" I'm pretty sure that's not how you answer a customer. A few minutes later she brought it out. She didn't seem too happy either. I was pleasantly surprised with my \""Green boba\"". Finally my meal came out. There was no sauce on the noodles? I was confused because the waiter said he could get me sauce without the meat and then told me he couldn't after he brought the meal out. If he would have just said that before I order I could have just left the restaurant without being upset. Being a Vegetarian I understand it's difficult to go out to restaurants. He then brought me a bowl of the sauce and said there is meat in and that I would have to scoop it out. It sort of bothered me but at this point I was just ready to leave. I still don't understand why they couldn't just prepare sauce without meat for me. The garlic bread tasted like toast and nothing like garlic bread. Again I wasn't expecting much considering I was ordering this from an Asian restaurant, but it seemed they put little effort into it. I give this place one star because I had horrible customer service and couldn't really enjoy my meal because of it. My Dad really enjoyed his meal (I think he got BBQ pork) but complained it made him feel sick later that night. I would like to go back to try to only to try the bakery part of the restaurant hopefully It will be a better experience for me.",0.0,0.9956485629081726

The salads were great, good flavor, cold and crisp.  Calamari was excellent, comes in a huge martini glass (tentacles and everything)!! The breading is light, not greasy and you can actually taste the calamari which is extremely tender.  The baked ziti was extremely dry, very little sauce.  Both marsala dishes came covered in a thick sauce which seemed more like a glaze rather than an actual marsala sauce; the meats were tender though.  All of the food (minus the salads) came out luke warm.\n\nThe green beans were the biggest disappointment; one of my aunts is a vegetarian, and this is one of her favorites.  We placed two orders to start, but both lacked flavor and seemed like the beans were previously frozen.  She sent one of the plates back and was brought a \""fresh, hot batch.\""  However this one was worse than the first two - no flavor, chewy and tasted like they had been quickly defrosted. \n\nThis is usually such a fun restaurant to come too and have family style meals; I've been to multiple locations but this one is the worst one by far.

Despite one of my friends disdain for Bobby Flay's personality as it appears on television, I was able to convince her and two others to join me for lunch at Mesa by promising an incredible meal.  Unfortunately Mesa didn't deliver that incredible meal, so I failed to follow through with my promise.\n\nPossibly the most disappointing was the bbq duck crepes.  On paper it sounds marvelous, but it actually tastes like an Ar-B-Q sandwich from Arby's -- honestly indiscernible.  There were more failures however.  While glazing things with miso has recently become popular, Mesa would not be a reason for this, as their miso-glazed salmon was absolutely terrible.  It has an odor reminiscent of ammonia, and a flavor that nearly matched.\n\nWe continued with our gastronomical hopes of grandeur but were continuously let down.  Some items were so forgettable, that I've actually forgotten all the different dishes we ate.  One dish in particular comes to mind as probably the second most disappointing of the meal; the sweet potato and duck hash.  Appealing in name, but the final product does not deliver.  The texture of the sweet potato was closer to baby food than to that of a hash, and the duck's flavor was smothered by the remnants of sweet potato suffocating my taste buds.\n\nOverpriced hype.\n\nBobby Flay, I challenge you to a throwdown.",0.0,0.9984034895896912

We ordered the Trout, Pork Loin, Truffle Sausage, Tartine du Jour (tuna nicoise) and the Chicken.\n\nFirst off, the the Petit Plateau was nice. Oysters, lobster, clams, mussels - it's $65 but it can feed 3 people easily which makes it definitely worth it. Everything was fresh although I still felt the Kumamotos at CraftSteak were a bit better. The Tomato salad was pretty good - good flavors and with the added goat cheese (something my waitress recommended), it balanced my meal very well.\n\nThat's sorta where the awesomeness stopped and the disappointment started. Pork loin was meh - though juicy and tender, I felt like I could have eaten this anywhere half-way decent. Tartine was just tuna salad on baguette with a side of fries. Truffle sausage wasn't anything spectacular and didn't have the richness usually associated with truffles. Chicken was... well, chicken. And the trout was probably the best tasting dish with a good presentation but again, nothing that blew me out of the water (pun intended).\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a custom cake from the Bouchon Bakery - chocolate with light vanilla frosting with strawberry sorbet. Unfortunately the sorbet was the best thing about the cake in my opinion. While the cake itself wasn't overtly sweet, it just felt like it was missing something. In fact, the entire meal felt like it was missing something.\n\nPlus, our waiter was TERRIBLE. He made awkward, TMI conversation with all of us and couldn't even remember the specials.

Finally a guy (Lydel) walked by a showed us to our tables.  He plopped down the menus, shortly asked us what we wanted to drink and left.  A few moments later he slams down our waters, asks us if we know what we want.  We barely had a chance to even open the menu.  I don't know why he was in a rush...I doubt his shift was going to end any time soon.  We weren't sure of when he would be back so we put in an order for the infamous sweet potato fries and an afternoon marg for the bf.  Again, quick service, but definitely not friendly.

So we put in our order for the chicken phyllo packets and the fez salad and fez kirsa.  Then we did into the fries.\nI was excited, because I absolutely love sweet potato fries!

I was hoping for a savory aioli to counter the incredible sweetness.  The phyllo packets were another disappointment.  The sauce seemed so watered down and again they were just lukewarm.  Then the entrees came...the kirsa was again lukewarm!  Do they not own a real oven in this place?  Ugh...I ordered hot food and expected it to be hot.

I was so grossed out that I had to return it and have the chef make me something different, which was better, but not amazing.

Nothing creative that you could say wow that was worth paying $385 for 2. \n\nWhat I was hoping for was a unique, creative tasting menu, artfully paired with wine in a beautiful outdoor setting.    This is what we got:\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately.  We had to sit inside as it was cold and there are no heaters, ok not a problem.  The staff explained we would not be seeing a menu and we would be adventurous..   After 10 minutes a glass of sparkling wine arrived.  We were told this one glass would be the pairing for the first 2 courses\n\nFirst course, 1 oyster on the shell   I dislike oyster so husband ate mine. \nHome made bread with honey & herb butter.  - nothing special\nPlate of salami  - dull\nBean soup - good\nMussels with linguine. - I don't like mussels so I sent mine back and got gnocchi instead which was good\nSalmon with potato - ok\nSteak with carrots - meat was not tender\n3 cheese plate - goat cheese, humbolt fog and ripe camembert   - This was the best thing we had.  \nApple crisp and cheesecake -  very disappointing, could have bought better in AJs.\nFrench press coffee was ok but the octagonal cups are not comfortable to drink from.\n\nThe wine pairings were ok but the service was so slow we usually finished the wine before the matching course arrived.  There was no bouche amuse but there was a palette cleanser of fruit sorbet.  \n\nThe bathroom.  - This was located very close to tables where people were eating and if it was occupied you find yourself standing in the dinners space.  There was an open basket of used hand towels on the floor to add to the ambiance.",0.0,0.9888540506362916

I came here in 2006 and had arguably one of the best seafood meals in my life. Everything was so good! Sad to say, I went back in 2012 and had the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas, and that's saying a lot because I've eaten in a lot of shady places. Worst martini ever! Seriously it tasted like the pool. My beer was equally disgusting. Someone needs to tell the waitress the cleanser they use on the glasses is way too strong. Got roasted corn clam chowder and would have guessed it was canned corn if it weren't for the boatloads of silk in it! Not to mention it was probably made the week previous. Oysters were small and chewy, To top it all off, the signature grill dish came with the spicy tomato diablo sauce instead of the brandy cream sauce. Don't get me wrong, I like spicy food but if I order something I expect to get what I paid for. It's probably better that i didn't eat it because the cook behind the line was unsanitary as hell. DUDE, WASH YOUR F'ing HANDS WHEN YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE!! HAVE YOU HEARD THE TERM \""DOUBLE DIPPING\""? When I told the waitress of the mistake she first tried to convince me that I was wrong, I was not, then took  the sanitizing liquid tasting anchor steam beer off the check. Like that makes it better. Luckily, at least the $100+ we spent didn't get us sick. I will never stay at the Sun Coast inn because this food was so bad. FOR SHAME!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9957491159439088

First, it's a beautifully done restaurant with a nice gas fireplace and elegant surroundings.  That comes with a fatal error.  There is a glass wall that separates this lovely dining room from the bar and several large TVs all tuned to basketball.  Can't you put some drapes on the glass and keep the dining room a dining room?  One other thing, it would be nice if you used real candles instead of those cheap plastic battery operated ones.  Goodness knows your profit margin on each steak would allow that.\n\nAs for the food, it is very over-priced.  Total bill for 1 person before tip was just under $80.  That was for 1 iced tea, a bowl of French onion soup, an 8 ounce filet mignon, a side of fingerling potatoes cooked in duck fat with thyme, and chocolate bread pudding.  That's it.\n\nThe bread basket had a nice selection with a slice each of olive, raisin, and sourdough bread, a pretzel roll, and one lavash.  The onion soup was standard.  It wasn't a rich tasting broth but standard.  My server didn't understand \""blue\"" so I said black and blue and then he responded with Pittsburgh style, and I said yes.  The steak was more medium rare than extra rare as it should have been.  The potatoes were much ado about little.  The bread pudding was excellent.  Service was quite good with several people seeing to more iced tea or checking on my dinner.\n\nI recently had a 5 course chef's tasting menu at a steakhouse at a Strip hotel and it was only a few dollars more and it included an 8 pounce American Wagyu filet.  I guess my expectations for t-Bones were simply too high.  It just doesn't produce a meal that merits the prices they charge.  It's a shame when you walk away from a pricey dinner and you remember the bread basket and the dessert.\n\nI should have listened to Holly!",0.0,0.9770854711532592

We walked in just after 5pm on Sat, only a couple of table were occupied, so not having a reservation didn't seem to be an issue and we were seated right away.  The waiter explained the menu well and took our orders.  While waiting for our appetizers and bread to be served, the hostess seated a party of four right next to us (in what was basically an empty restaurant) -- the people had a small DOG with them.  I immediately looked at the hostess and said this would be a problem for me, and one of the 4 people quickly said \""it's a service dog\"" (looked like a household pet to me).  I got up and said to my girlfriend, their table and the hostess \""We'll go to another restaurant\"" -- no attempt was made to have us stay.

Bacon was overused and not very high quality. We hated the creamed spinach.

I was with my boss and another colleague on business and decided on your restorante over many other establishments in the Venetian primarily because I have always respected your cooking on TV but never had the chance to experience it.  After hearing the waiter provide the review of our options, I persuaded the others at the table to go with the Pasta Tasting dishes so we could get a feel of more than one thing.  Not only was everything too salty, but it took at least 45mins to get the 1st dish which was basically a portion so tiny, it took me 2 mouthfuls to eat.  It smelled like bleach, and the plating was very beige and white with nothing high class like I would expect for the price.  45 mins later out next course came out, smaller than the first, looking the same and tasting the same...salty.  After another 20 mins or so for our next course, I was so embarrassed about it all that I felt bad my boss would be paying for it.  He actually said something to the waiter that we had an early morning and could he speed it up.  Another 30mins passed, with 2 more dishes of equally tiny portions, mine being one amount, and the others at the table have either was more, or way less, with the last black spaghetti being the only plate with any real flavor that was worth it.  Only problem was there was barely any there to eat.  How can you justify the price for an amount that is equal to maybe half a dinner plate if it all came out together?  I just don't get it.  The only saving grace was the dessert, but even that looked like the same bland beige looking meal, that was about 3 mouthfuls to finish.  \n\nIt took 3 hours for us to complete our meal, and if it wasn't for the 5 pieces of bread I ate, I would have probably gone to McDonalds to at least get something substantial in my stomach before I went to bed.

For being a Sunday and being prime lunch time there were only about 2-3 people ahead of us when we got to the tortilla press yet not one person greeted us when we entered the building, not even the manager who was working on the line. Then when we did get to the line we received no greeting other then 'what can I get for you.' Then was denied my request for a specific item that has been receiving A LOT of attention. I had requested a quesadilla and a burrito and was going to request that my burrito was wrapped with the quesadilla. Commonly being referred to as a 'quesaritto.'\n\nThe tortilla press worker didn't consult any other staff and did not take into consideration that there wasn't more then three people behind us. The entire mood of the restraint was actually quite dull. The only person who seemed to be in any type of friendliness was the girl working at the salsa station and even that was minimal. There was NOTHING exceptional or anything near the expectations that I have usually received for a chipotle visit. For the tortilla press girl to refuse my request like that was infuriating and to have an excuse such as 'we don't do that during certain hours' is ludicrous. If I were to visit ANY other establishment and request something off of their 'secret' menu I would never be denied. \n\nNeedless to say I am utterly disappointed with the entire visit and will also be posting said review on Yelp. I hope when I call into the store that they have a better explanation for why I was denied my request since this was the one thing I visited the store for today. \n\nAlso, for the individual just standing in plain site in a baseball cap and street clothes was the icing in the cake for me. I won't be returning to this location ever. \n\nOnly reason I'm giving this is a two star is because I still love the food.",0.0,0.9995753169059752

The reason it gets 2 stars is because the service was very good - other than that, not impressed.  With so many other choices in Vegas, I won't be going back to this restaurant.\n\nWe started in the bar with a couple drinks and their breadsticks - these were fantastic and probably the best part of the meal!\n\nIt wasn't that the food was awful, it just wasn't great for what I was expecting.  After reading about David Burke on the James Beard website, then seeing the menu - I thought this place was bound to be good.  Ahhh, but no, I was wrong -\n\nFor Appetizers we had the Artichoke blossom - the leaves were raw and the heart was raw or close to it.  I had asked if it was intentional and I was told yes, it is better raw than cooked.  OK, fine maybe some people prefer their artichoke raw - but I prefer to be able to eat it.  The presentation was pretty, but taste, not so much.\n\nWe also had their pretzel crab cake that was good, but not good enough to order again.\nThe final appetizer was their shrimp.  Presentation was unique - it was brought out on a extremely hot rock and the shrimp was split onto two skewers.  The shrimp sat atop the rock where it had to cook.  So... it was brought out raw and you needed to wait for it to cook on the rock.  Fine, I have no problem with a different way of presenting food, if it works.  Our shrimp took FOREVER to cook and we were told to make sure it was opaque/white on the ends and if it didn't cook well or fast enough, to hold it down against the rock with my fork!  Excuse me - if you are going to do this - shouldn't the rock do all the work.  I didn't select a cook my own food restaurant for dinner.  Anyway - it was barely cooked by the time we did decide to eat it.\n\nEntree - with all the appetizers we opted on one entree and a side of their croquettes.  The entree was their salmon, next to the breadsticks it was the best part of the meal.  Cooked well and tasty.\n\nThe croquettes (I believe they were gouda) - had no cheese flavor at all, very bland.  I don't think I even finished mine which is saying a lot when it comes to a fried cheesy thing.\n\nDessert - passed - couldn't wait to get out of there.

They got us in and it was, as usual, an exceptional meal.\n\nFinally - look elsewhere - there are so many good places in Vegas, fine one of them.",0.0,0.986148476600647

My friend ended up sending hers back, I really wanted to send mine back too but since I was sharing with another person we did eat a good amount of it already so decided to just pay for that poor appetizer choice.\n\nMy entree ws pretty good. I got the branzino. It's skin was crisped nicely and the fish perfectly cooked and seasoned. I felt bad for the rest of the table because I don't think anyone else liked their entree. This was definitely a downer. Also our waiter didn't seem to care too much when we said the octopus was not to our liking. He did take it back, but reluctantly. \n\nConsidering how disappointing the food was and the service was just OK, I would not come back.",0.0,0.9789935350418092

I'd say that for the amount of money that we spent, we could've gotten a much better meal somewhere else. When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\n\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\n\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back.",0.0,0.9992526173591614

See also: Encore Bistro & Bar\n\nWhen some friends and I were searching for a brunch spot near Matthews Encore came to mind. I knew there had recently been a Yelp event there and saw this as a chance to make up for missing it. To top it off some of the group were really feeling French toast and the menu claimed they had Charlotte's best.\n\nI arrived a bit late (because I didn't realize it would take 45 minutes to get there from Plaza Midwood) and was immediately blind upon walking in the door. I understand low lighting is hip, but in the middle of the day it makes it impossible to see. No sir, I have no clue where my party is.\n\nWe ordered two French toasts (one w/whipped cream; one without), two sides of eggs, a Belgian waffle and a steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. Oh and 3 coffees...for which we somehow received 4 separate containers of cream. When a member of the kitchen staff brought out the food neither toast had whipped cream and we were told that they had run out of berries but were going to get more. When our waitress came around we relayed the message and she went to the kitchen, returning shortly with bowls of berries.\n\nLesson: Low lighting also does not allow you to see that the berries you have just been given are rotten until you put them in your mouth. Eww.\n\nEventually fresh fruit was procured, the whipped cream situation was straightened out and we settled down to what turned into a fairly decent meal. Both the waffle and toast were tasty and the sweet potato fries were standout.\n\nThe bottom line was that the food was not outstanding enough to account for the comedy of errors that preceded it.

I almost want to say worse as now it was 1/2 hot and 1/2 cool,  which tells me microwave!!!!!   I ordered the spicey shrimp pasta,  the six or so tiny shrimp were very good,  the pasta was awful and had zero flavor,  so I left it and my dinner consisted of 6 or so shrimp. \nMy husband had Spaghetti Bolioniase,  which was good.  \nGuess I will stick to True Foods and leave it at that.",0.0,0.997128427028656

Well, it was literally a head of lettuce with dressing drizzled over it.  As you might imagine, a coating of dressing over 1 piece of lettuce is not enough for an entire head of lettuce.  The burger I shared was ok, a little undercooked, not the best.

Our entrees, however, both sucked hardcore.  My pasta had a somewhat sweet flavor, and I felt like the lobster use was stingy in addition to being overcooked.  And, the pasta was not al dente at all-it was actually falling apart.  My friend's entree was straight up bad.  The curry was way to thin and liquidy, and the chicken was dry and overcooked.  We ended up sending that dish back, and the friendly busser told us that most customers don't like that dish in particular, in addition to my pasta as well.  She was surprised I didn't send the garganelli back too. I'd also like to mention that the bread bowl that I had been looking forward to all day was disappointing as well!

First, in terms of design, it's simply one of the coolest restaurants in Montreal. It has this 1970s Moroccan salon style that reminds me of a Middle Eastern recreation of the Cantina from Star Wars. They also have belly dancing performances. Sounds good but then you go.  \n\nFirst problem: the food. It's unbelievably overpriced and the food is just plain mediocre.  The table d'hote to go with the \""belly dancing\"" special costs something like 40 bucks with tax. This is an insane price for couscous (which basically costs nothing) with poor quality meat (fatty) and even more poorly prepared (dry, dry, dry).  But I guess you pay not so much for the food but for the show and for the atmosphere.  And that brings us to the next problem. The belly dancing show that I saw was mediocre at best (the dancer just wasn't that good) and the sound system was so bad it was hissing more static than music. And the final strike: the obnoxious people who go there. My impression is that its mainly middle-aged Hydro Quebec and government workers from the office towers nearby (the kind who try to assert their individuality by dying their hair unnatural shades of red and purple) who go after a day of soul-sucking bureaucratic labor in order to escape into some exotic fantasy land.

I had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed. Went on a Monday and the place was dead. I know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes:\n\nTo start - I found the d\u00e9cor to look a bit cheesy, like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel.. What's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti? The music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker, by the time we got our food we could barely see.\n\nOur waitress was nice and recommended her favorites. So many people have raved about this place, but I found the fusion either bland or overspiced. \n\nShabu Hot and Sour was served first - This soup had no spice to it at all, even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice. The lime broth, while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat, so we just picked out all the veggies. \n\nSpicy Wontons came out next - Chicken and pepper jack.. This tasted as though it had been frozen for ages, no flavor and very little amount of chicken.\n\nVolcano Beef - Nice touch on the \""sear it yourself\"" hot rock. We could see the beef was marinated, but we couldn't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger. \n\nAt this point we were so disappointed with the food, and still hungry. We left and walked down the street to Moira, another disappointment. Review to follow.",0.0,0.9991825222969056

As a Hawaiian restaurant you would expect them to take pride in a staple such as kalua pork but I found the very opposite to be true because the meat was tasteless and cabbage was raw. On the other hand my vegetarian girlfriend custom ordered fried rice and found meat in it. At the prices they were asking and the service they were providing you might as well go to an L&L chain. At least there you will get better quality at a cheaper price.\n\n\nPros: \n1. The French fries were cooked perfectly\n2. There was at least one very nice waitress\n\nCons: \n1. The first server we met was rude and unhelpful.\n2. The next server did not have much knowledge of the food and menu.\n3. Kalua pork was tasteless and cabbage was raw.\n4.

I've had their Jerry Lewis burger before and it was great.  Today I again ordered one, and my daughter ordered the Breakfast Burger.  My burger was RAW in the middle.  Now I like my burgers on the medium side but this was RAW and left blood on my plate.  Oh and did I mention that we waited more than 30 minutes to get our food???  Well, the waitress took the burger back and left the fries for me to eat.  (Hmmm, why not fresh fries with the new burgers?)  A few bites later, my daughter got into the middle of her burger and it also was raw, even though we thought it would be okay as the patty was thinner.  Back it went, and again the fries were left to get cold.  I told the waitress we were very disappointed and did not want to sit there another 30 minutes waiting for replacement burgers after both turned out to be undercooked.  She brought us a bill charging us for 2 baskets (4.99 each) of fries!!  which by the way she whisked off the table along with my daughter's fork so she couldn't even eat the coleslaw.   I asked her if she thought we had had the benefit of 2 baskets of fries and she admitted that no, and changed the bill to 5.95.  Wow - what a bargain.  After spending a good 40 minutes in there, leaving hungry, we paid for the privilege.  Did I mention that half the fries were hard and underooked as well?  I wasn't even aware that you could make hard half raw fries!!  Time for some new cooks in the kitchen.  We will NOT be going back even if they do have great shakes.  Well, maybe just for the shakes.  As we left we passed a univ. student with a half eaten burger - visibly raw in the centre.  They will be lucky if nobody dies of e-coli from there.",0.0,0.9979538917541504

The outdoor appeal and girly decor drew me in for lunch. \n\nIt was around 4 PM and it was super busy. It took a while for our waitress to finally reach us to take our order. For an appetizer, we ordered the Grilled Globe Artichokes, which was a big mistake. The artichokes we were served were quite small, dry and burnt, and we could barely salvage anything from them. We only got a couple leaves from each piece (three in total) and for $15, it wasn't worth it. We asked if we could order something else. The waitress let us know that the artichoke is suppose to be like that, but will gladly give us something different. We ordered chicken quesadillas. They were very average. Almost microwave quality.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chop Chop salad, which is basically like a garbage salad (not literally) and I didn't care for it at all. The chicken quality wasn't good and the salad was overall very bland. It reminded me of a cafeteria salad. My friend ordered The Full Monty Chicken Sandwich and she didn't care for hers either. \n\nAt this point we came to the conclusion that this place is probably better known for their sundaes and not their food, as just about every table was enjoying a big sundae. I'm a sucker for Red Velvet Cake, so when I spotted Red Velvet Sundae on the menu, I didn't have to do any other reading. The sundae was huge and contained loads of chocolate ice cream, a slice of red velvet cake and whipped cream and sprinkles. The cake was mediocre and frankly didn't have much flavor. The chocolate ice cream was super good and creamy - almost like a rich, chocolate frozen custard or gelato. The mix of red velvet doesn't go smoothly with chocolate ice cream (yes I know Red Velvet Cake is technically chocolate cake).. it's a bit overpowering to where you can't taste the cake. It'd probably be better with vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not good enough to OD on. \n\nUnfortunately not impressed and probably wouldn't recommend. Also, no restrooms in the restaurant.

In a city known for its delicious, extravagant buffets, and in this brand new hotel, for $37, I expected much more.\n\nWe mostly went for the unlimited wine (chardonnay or merlot) and lobster. No line at 5PM and our party of 11 was seated right away. We were also made to go back to the line and pay a separate 18% gratuity charge when they realized we were all in the same group. Sure, we are served wine, and we probably would have left something anyway, but a forced gratuity for a BUFFET is just ridiculous in principle. That meant we had no intention to leave anything else. \n\nOur waiter, who turned out to be awesome, started by bringing small carafes of whatever wine we wanted. He ended up bringing 4 or 4 at a time and just leaving them on the table. You definitely won't go thirsty here. \n\nThe food was not as much of a selection as most other buffets I've been to. Not many desserts and they weren't as good as other buffets. The rest of the food consisted of carved meats (including salmon), sushi, crab legs, peeled shrimp, some Asian stir fries, salad, pasta, and a few others. Nothing was spectacular enough for me to want to go back for more, and they seemed to be missing most of the basics. The crab legs were pre-cut in half, which I liked (I'm lazy). \n\nEach person got 1/2 a lobster, which I really enjoyed. If you like lobster, crab legs, shrimp, and as much wine as your heart desires, this is the place to you.

They got the bread and toppings wrong on our burgers. However, to avoid waiting any longer, we just ate what we had. The kaiser roll's on the burgers were completely stale and hard as rocks. With that said, the burger (I got the turkey burger) itself was pretty decent tasting. I also didn't like that the burgers didn't come with any side - no fries, chips, nothing. Considering the burger prices ranged between $10-$15, I definitely think they should have come with some kind of side dish.

Secondly, it's very loud in there and people are sitting 9-10 at a four top which makes it tight at your table beside them. Lastly, the food was just okay. I thought it would be amazing but it was just good. I had the fish and chips and sub the wedges for the parmasean fries which were pretty good!

Instead she snapped her fingers followed with a couple \""um's\"" and a laugh. \n\n-The queso that we added to pair with the salsa and chips was rather bland. It reminded me of something out of a jar in the supermarket. \n\n-I ordered the Veggie Tacos which, according to the menu and online menu, it should come with saut\u00e9ed Portobello mushrooms, roasted corn relish, sweet plantains, and grilled zucchini toped with queso fresco. Mouth watering right? However, I received two tacos with zucchini, two strips of mushrooms, and cheese on top. The server never came back to see how our food was, so luckily the manager passed by and I told her some things were missing. She proceeded to cross her arms then point at the tacos while asking \""what is missing?\"" I was surprised by both her body language and tone. After telling her what was missing she said that what I received is what comes on the Veggie Tacos. I didn't feel the need to persist, so I told her it was fine. \n\n-The server came by about 10 minutes later to ask was everything fine. Before asking for the checks, I told her that I thought the service and food would be better and she responded \""yeah\"" and smiled. \n\n-I understand that sometimes people have a bad day, but the entire short lived experience was unacceptable. \n\n-I will not be returning to this restaurant or recommending it for anyone who wants Mexican cuisine, but I wish them the best of luck with improvements!",0.0,0.9897328019142152

Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice don't order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys' strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.  \n\nThe AYCE peanuts were good though; it is a shame that these were the highlight of the meal.",0.0,0.9725762009620668

It makes an auction sound like a funeral in comparison. However, this is acceptable because it is on the Strip after all.

For a venue called \""Sugar\"" Factory the food was too salty. I don't know if they add dashes of salt on top of the bacon and beef patty, but it's overkill. The fries are like substitute slices of cardboard. I had McDonalds fries that tastes 3 times better, hands down any day of the week. The Fettuccine noodles were undercooked, extremely chewy, and did not saturate the sauce whatsoever. After a while, the hot plate eventually softened the pasta which made the Fettuccine taste acceptable, but disappointing regardless.

I didn't know that it was possible to not like grilled cheese.  They used the heel of the bread, and there was literally one slice of cheese and lots of salty, chewy ham (like pre-packaged from a grocery store).

The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.\n\nWe had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  \n\nImagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \""cracker-like\"" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.\n\nNow, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.\n\nAfter my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.\n\nThe pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.\n\n20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. \n\nThe high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck.",0.0,0.9987359642982484

I'm really disappointed with my latest foray here. The decor is still very nice and upscale and the service is still friendly, but what the heck has happened to the food?!\n\nWe ended up here after driving around for about an hour looking for a place that didn't have a two hour wait and I've had good experiences here before so I was sure it'd be a nice night out when the hostess said she could seat us right away. Man was I wrong. We started with the Lobster Mac & Cheese. The cheesiest thing about the dish was the ritz cracker crust on top. I realize that sounds very sad, that's because it is. The lobster was great on it's own and there were decent chunks throughout the dish. The mac part though? It really could've just said lobster with pasta in a cream sauce and I probably would've believed them. Not very cheesy and kind of runny instead of a glorious gooey concoction I was hoping for. I finished it off though and good thing too because I ordered the wagyu burger and I managed about 2-3 bites before I gave up due to how hard it was to eat combined with how flavorless and dry the meat was. That thing tasted like pure disappoint if disappointment had a taste. I ended up eating some of my dining partner's pulled pork ravioli, and dipping my fries in the sauce.\n\nOur waiter was friendly if a little slow on taking orders and water refills. Pacing of the meal was spot on, the appetizers came out shortly after our order was filled and entrees came shortly afterwards I like that they pay attention to timing. However I gotta say he was really turning a blind eye to customer satisfaction. He saw that I didn't like or eat my burger, and didn't want to take it home, and I even said out loud when he was clearing the table \""What a disappointment\"" and he just went on merrily clearing plates returning a short time later to see if we wanted dessert. No thanks I'd just like to leave and go get a burger at cookout so I can stop being hungry.\n\nThis has left a very bad impression on my friend and I find myself hard pressed to make a return trip here now after this experience. I am sad that I pretty much ate a $14 piece of pickle and fries for dinner. So two stars means Meh. I've experienced better. You know where I've experienced better?

By the time the girl came back over i told her to forget about it and we just wanted our check. she took off the hush puppies because of everything (which i totally appreciated) and boxed up the \""replacement\"" burger and we left asap.

I'm sure he noticed that the dish was barely touched when he dropped off the other tapas.  But I do give him props for taking it off my bill.  \n\nSooooooo all in all..

Restaurant week is something that my close group of friends looks forward to every year. It's a great time to experience something special from a restaurant we have not tried before. Our expectations were high are that the food and service would be impeccable since Restaurant Week is a showcase for creativity. Unfortunately, it was not the case this year. We had a reservation for 10 for Saturday evening. We were promptly seated at a long, comfortable table. However, things went down from there. First off, there were wine substitutions for the meal pairings. The pairing ($10 additional or $5 a glass) was a bargain, but the replacement wines did not match well with the food. The appetizers were a disappointment across the board. I heard negative comments about the ceviche and the corn chowder. I had the goat cheese fondue along with several others (with high praise from the server).  We all commented on its unpleasant, non-fondue-like texture and the tasteless crackers that accompanied it. The entrees fared no better. The salmon was overcooked, the tortellini was bland and the skirt steak was tough and not very favorable as skirt steaks usually are. The worst thing (noted by several others) was an artichoke and leek gratin. It was thick and dry as spackle and the worst item of the night. Nothing came out at the proper temperature. Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever.

Then we were given little, tiny bowls to make our meat/veggie/sauce selections, and they add noodles or rice for you. I found that incredibly unusual for this type of restaurant, so I suppose I just don't like the concept.

This is a pizza joint yet it really felt like going to an Olive Garden where one is pressured to buy an appetizer, cocktail, or dessert in order to jack up the bill. Ridiculous. \n\nNow, the pizza.  The pizza was mediocre at best and certainly not up to snuff at the other Grimaldi's location we've been too. Ordered large sausage pie but it was really light on the sauce and the cheese. I actually like sauce all over my pie and cheese as well but the cook just drizzled on the sauce and then filled in the gaps with cheese. In other words the entire pizza was not covered with sauce or cheese. Also they usually put a decent amount of fresh basil on their pizzas but not this time. Maybe two small pieces of basil on an entire large pie?

Could make a better beer brat in my kitchen with Johnsonville Brats, beer and onions boiling on the stove, then browned over the grill.\n\nWine and beer selection was good.\nEmployees were friendly.\n\nToo many other restaurants in town to waste a night at the Brat Haus again.",0.0,0.9887884259223938

I come to Vegas a few times a year and have eaten at many of the higher end restaurants with this being a place I wish never to return to.  I figured it would be a safe bet since we were attending Le Reve after dinner.  My sister and I sat on the Teppan side and I have had better and less expensive meals at smaller chains and even Benihana.  The view of the waterfalls were pretty, especially at night.  The service was ok, our server was friendly..  but the meal...  Ugh!  My sister chose the tofu and gardein meal while I chose the chicken.  The meal was so incredibly salty, it was almost inedible.  I think we each drank 3 glasses of water and didn't even finish or get close to finishing our meal.  The chicken was so overlooked, it was almost dry and difficult to eat unless you dipped in a sauce or drank a gulp of water after. I heard the tofu and gardein were cooked well, but again VERY salty.  I have had a variety of good and bad meals at Teppan restaurants and for $65, I expect that you are not going to mess up a chicken breast.  I can do that at home for about $7.  The vegetables were cooked well, but again, a bit on the salty side.  The only bright side to this meal was the dessert.  The little gelato with crumble was delicious.  The little lemon cheesecake was ok..  Nothing special. It took forever for someone to clear our plate and I am assuming this was because our plates were nearly full.  I remember the chef's name but I am not going to be mean and call him out because he was a nice guy who was a bit on the entertaining side.  I really wish I had decided to go to Carnevino instead... This place gave me the worst birthday meal... Ever.  For the price and location, I expected perfection or something close to it.  Incredible disappointment.",0.0,0.9929612278938292

Bland dirty dish water. \n\nOverall, not worth the $60 we spent there!  I'd rather go out of my way to Joe's and spend less money and get my money's worth.

I had lunch at The Skinny Italian several months ago and couldn't wait to go back.  The bolognese sauce was one of the best I've had in a restaurant (when compared to my very own).  Last night my husband and I went with two other couples.  I had called ahead for a reservation and asked for a table, not a booth, for 6, but when we arrived, the front table, evidently the only one for 6 or 8 had to be set up for six.  The server was very new and appeared afraid to take our orders.  We ordered drinks but had to change our order since they were out the beer ordered and a wine we wanted.  We were offered a taste of a Pinot Grigio which was very nice but we ordered a different wine.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer and the escargot were average at best.  The service was extremely slow even though there were very few in the restaurant.  When the food arrived, I was really disappointed in the bolognese on my angel hair pasta.  I really had been looking forward to the tasty sauce I previously had.  The sauce was bitter and did not have a great flavor.  My husband's puttanesca sauce was good but the chicken he ordered with it was evidently boiled and had an unusual color.  Two at our table did enjoy their meals, a penne with clams and the puttanesca penne without the chicken.  Unfortunately, we won't be going back.

We had a group of 6 for dinner here about 90 min before they were closing.\n\nLet me just cut to the chase on why I don't ever plan on Bacchanal-ing again:\n1. The wait for this place is somewhat confusing. You walk up to this lady that gives you a ticket and she tells you, \""15 min for your group.\"" So we're thinking, \""Wow! Only 15 min to get seated? Awesome!\"" WRONG-O! It's about 15 min to get in a line to then pay and get in the longer line to get seated. Boo! Don't tease us like that lady!\n\n2. They seated us wayyyyy in the back, like literally having to trek it out to even get to the food. There were plenty of tables closer to the buffet area that needed to be cleaned off. Seemed like they were understaffed.\n\n3. Food. Blah! Yep, I said it. Everything seemed too salty and not much effort put into cooking it. Only thing I really enjoyed were the snow crab legs and their sweet potato tater tots (which were probably frozen to begin with).\n\n4. Pricey. Yes, it's a Vegas buffet, I know. But the quality of the food is not up to par to have it priced \""Vegas style\"".\n\nHere's one plus that actually solidifies why my review is staying the way it is:\nOur waiter was hilarious. He had jokes up the culo. We also were really upfront with him and told him the food wasn't all that. So..he also let us in on a little tidbit. Apparently, the old food court at Caesar's that closed down had chefs over there that held seniority. So those crappy food court chefs quite possibly booted out the stellar chefs that first started out here at Bacchanal and that is why the food is crapola today.\n\nMy live review in my YouTube vlog here during that weekend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhN4ggfu52w&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA",0.0,0.9980639815330504

The buns were also cold. For $24 I expected to get what I asked for. Spoke to the manager who seemed quite indifferent and sent the rest of the food away with her.

I had the shepards pie, which Mr Ramsay has featured on many a special. It was good, but the presentation was mediocre...a crock of Shepard's pie that looks like someone took a crap in a bowel and served it. I had a side salad of weeds, with a tasteless vinaigrette and a few slices of apple. Hardly appealing. I would rate this dining experience 1.5 out of 5 at best. Chef, I am truly disappointed.

I had such high hopes since everyone on yelp wanted to rant and rave about how good the wolf pack was as well as the strawberry rosemary lemonade.  I had come here with my boyfriend who is not a huge breakfast fanatic like myself and I have tried so many places as far as breakfast goes.  My favorite is still Crackers and Co by far.  \n\nSo as my boyfriend made all the faces known to man looking at everything I was pretty set on what I was about to order.  As I thought about ordering the wolfpack I was tempted to order the half order of the carmelized banana french toast; but saw other peoples plates and the size of the wolfpack sort of forgetting about they had the wolfpack club opted out of getting the french toast(bad idea, b/c the wolfpack was a lot smaller obviously) .\n In my opinion the wolfpack and the woldfpack club is COMPLETELY overpriced. I can make the club for about 11 dollars spent at the grocery store and serve up 12 dishes of it.  I know restaurants tend to be overpriced especially this once since guy fieri has been to the main location.  As our food was on its way my boyfriend b****ed and moaned about how gross both the lemonades we had ordered were(rosemary and mint) and i couldn't agree more.  Then came to realize that there was an alcoholic beverage menu which he then decided to complain how he didn't see it and wish he saw it first. Our waiter had said he doesn't drink and IMO probably why he decided not to tell us about the menu to start off with.  My boyfriend is irish and can definitely drink like a fish; Every drink he had ordered that was SUPPOSED to contain alcohol he said it did not taste like there was an ounce of alcohol in it.\n\nAs our food had arrived, I noticed that the wolf pack would disappear within a matter of 5-10 minutes, and had wished that I ordered the french toast half order.  My boyfriend order the chiliquiles and looked like nachos with 2 over easy eggs on top. definitely glad I didn't order that for breakfast.  Some of my boyfriends toast was burnt so i ate the burnt slices for him to scrape my plate with.  Today's total for our food and drinks was not what I expected to spend for 25 dollars a person.  If I would have knew we were going to spend that much I would have waited til sunday and went to wandering horse buffet for all you can eat for 5 dollars more a plate. Or waited for dinner and went to fogo de chao for all you can eat brazilian steak and such.  What a waste. \n\nWhen I go back with my friends, I will be ordering the half order of carmelized french toast and steak.

I asked about the salt and said the pizza was almost inedible last time because it was too darn salty and she said the chef makes the sauce in the morning and a new batch a sauce can not be made for a customer. so much for the customer is always right.  So, the lasagna was awful not enough to feed one person very very thin not even one inch thick and inedible way way way too salty. The frozen lasagna in the grocery section tastes better and is way thicker without the added salt. The pizza was also inedible and way way way too salty, I threw it away.  I really expected this place to taste better and have better quality of food.  There pasta is NOT made from scratch they buy it, this might make a difference.  Maybe the chef can learn that lots of salt does not add but take away taste.

We had a party of seven and were seated promptly at the time of our reservation.  Two of us started with the Caesar salad, to be prepared table side.  We were in an alcove, with a very large party just outside, so our waiter explained, when delivering the salads, that the table side preparation wasn't possible due to the space constraints.  Salad was huge romaine leaves, sharp, pungent shreds of Parmesan cheese and a very bland dressing, devoid of any identifiable flavors.\n\nTwo in our party ordered the roast chcken, which was served in a red wine sage sauce, which they reported to be delish.  The chicken, however, was overcooked, dry and flavorless.  Disappointment for both.\n\nHubby just got the oysters on the half-shell appetizer as he wasn't that hungry.  Said they were ok; however, later that night he appeared to have gotten food poisoning and was ill the next 24 hours.  Not sure where it came from, but this is a possibility.\n\nTwo in our party ordered the filet mignon, with zip sauce.  No idea what is in the zip sauce but it added nothing to the flavor.  For $39 it was not something that was amazing enough to order again.  \n\nI opted for the chopped steak, with zip sauce.

I ordered what is their version of fajitas, now I saw cheese on the list of ingredients for the dish, and to me meat and cheese is not a bad thing. What I did not expect is: mealy textured meat, as if defrosted wrong, meat cooked on a flat iron that had no flavor of its own and a puddle of salty, oily cheese that was disgusting. The flavors were out of balance and one of the worst dishes I have ever seen or tasted. The tortillas were wet and sticky on one side and dry on the other, I mean how do you screw that up??????\n\nService started out good, there was a delay in getting our first and second rounds of drinks, but I can understand a busy bar. The fact that our server filled up an ice tea a table away and did not bother to fill my water glass when it was empty was not good. But when she leaned across a railing that was behind me to ask me if I wanted another drink, is where it went down hill. Three steps more and she could have been table side. So now we forward to me telling our server about my main course, she takes it away, I never see a manager, and before we could consider ordering desert, coffee or even finish our second round of drinks she plops the check in front of my face. The asks \""Oh you didn't want any thing else did you?\""  WOW! I have never been so insulted of felt like I was being told to 'Get the hell out' in my life. I was so mad I could not speak and no manager ever bothered to follow up with us about dinner.\n\nI am in the service industry and have work in every thing from Chevy's to Micheline Star rated establishments and this by far was the WORST experience I have ever had!!!! I will never return to this place!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9993588328361512

The server was a nice enough guy but definitely did not have a sense of urgency about anything (or even a sense of 'that table may need a drink refill').  It took about 15 minutes for us to get our bill and pay which was surprising considering there was virtually no one in the restaurant.\n\nThe food was our biggest disappointment.

We came here because our friends had ordered the Lechon for Thanksgiving and we really liked it and thought the restaurant would have some delicious treats for us. The place was easy to find, but when we got there, no one greeted us and we had to find the server. Once we were seated and looked over the menu, I asked about a special drink they had listed, but wasn't available so I ordered water. I ordered oxtail soup while my boyfriend ordered the shrimp pancit. 10 mins later we were finally served our drinks. Then almost 15 mins from the time we ordered our server informed us that they were out of shrimp. I suggested my boyfriend order something else all together... but the server told us the pancit was already being made... so we settled for pork. My oxtail soup came out first. I could hardly wait. But my palate tasted nothing extraordinary... if I could describe the taste in color it would be a boring gray... the oxtail's mild taste was thrown off by watered down broth. It almost brings me to tears as I write this, such a waste of good meat. The pancit joined us about 5 minutes later. I can almost make up excuses for bad oxtail since it takes so long to prepare... but there is absolutely no excuse to have bad pancit... And the pancit noodles where great... but what the hell were they thinking? Hard pieces of non-edible pork was riddled amongst the flavorful yummy pancit... WTF it was so horrible. But the final blow to our meal time experience was  the check... my boyfriend had though he ordered the solo meal pancit.. but instead was charged for the family size. There was no conformation from the sever and granted, the boyfriend didn't specify he wanted the solo meal... but come on this is suppose to be a professional business and I am sure this hasn't only happened to my boyfriend.  Instead of correcting and complaining we left, disappointed and curious as to why this place has sure high marks. The pork was good when it was ordered to go for thanksgiving... but the dine-in experience could be improved upon: more flavor in the beef broth, get rid of the \""pork\"" in your pancit and get some shrimp... there are people trying to eat here!",0.0,0.9993091821670532

Ate there a few months ago and was pleased but went back last night and was almost insulted by what I had been served. I was informed that the dishes were sharing sizes which I felt okay paying $20 for (I was a party of two).  I was then told that the dish was best eaten as a thali so I said sure. When I received my lamb and okra dish I was given only bones with no meat at all, this is not an exaggeration. As well in the thali I was given about a tablespoons worth of humus, a few triangles of pita bread and rice with a tiny salad. For $20 !!! I have eaten all over Montreal as I have lived here for years and I've never been so ripped off. The waitress, although very kind and understanding, could not offer us anything other than a few shots, which although was nice, did not fill my belly up at all and I was still starving. Finally our bill came to $63 as they charged us for two thali's (my boyfriend got two pieces of meat with his, so he gave me one of his)- so they charged us for two thali's despite me asking if it was meant to be shared based on how expensive it was.  I was actually rather insulted and offended by the whole thing. I could have and should have cabbed it to Park X and got the same dish for a fraction of the price and left full and satisfied and cabbed it home for less than what I would have paid to have eaten there.

This is the first time I am writing a review but I felt it necessary as this place caters to a younger generation for the most part and for many of us times are tight and going for a dinner out doesn't happen as often as we wish and thus one wants the experience to be fulfilling and satiating - which this was not.

I found that I couldn't tell if it was a crab cake.  The menu said the hollandaise sauce was \""infused\"" with Andouille sausage but I found when it was served that it actually had chunks of sausage with it.  It didn't go together well.  Also, the green and red peppers served on the dish were too raw.  Finally, the egg was not poached well.  The yolk was way too runny for a poached egg.\n\nMy wife's omelet was good, according to her.  It was on the smaller size for the price, IMO.  Also, she asked for grits instead of potatoes.  What she got was grits AND potatoes and we were charged for both.  That's fine if they don't sub, but the waiter didn't mention it.  Same deal with the biscuit instead of the English muffin.  No mention of the upcharge.",0.0,0.9992642998695374

When coming to a vietnamese restaurant, you'd think the flavor would have some tradition in there and not a bland flavor.

We asked the waiter/waitress where my order was as it had already been ten minutes after the pho came out. They said there was a back order in the kitchen. How the heck is there a back order when no one was there yet when we ordered?! great cover up...but not really because we told them there was no one here when we ordered and they just looked stumped......... by the time it finally did arrive which was 20 minutes later.... the food looked like it had been sitting under the warmer the whole time and so did the taste of it. \n\nFor a place that received so many great reviews, highly disappointed.

I asked for a side if ranch, and wouldn't you know...I finished half my food before it arrived.\n\nThe \""signature\"" burger wasn't all that much better. First, they need to use a different bun. It fell apart immediately. The burger itself was dry, overlooked, and under seasoned. I think they hoped all the other toppings would mask that. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese was bland. The blue box at home would have left this stuff in the dust. The bacon was carelessly placed and hanging off the side  when it came.\n\nI will say the fries were good. A combination of curly, shoestring, crinkle cut, and waffle fries with some BBQ cheddar kind of seasoning.\n\nIt seemed like everything on the menu was $20. We passed on the disappointment of ordering a desert and chalked this experience up to something we could say we've done. :/",0.0,0.9995383024215698

I reluctantly  chose the mac and cheese and over the next 25 minutes was actually looking forward to them, but maybe that was just the intense hunger I was feeling after the long wait. When the food arrived, a basket of chicken tenders were placed in front of me as the waitress mumbled \""oh, guess there were chicken tenders\""  The entire order was incorrect and and the food was almost inedible. I don't complain about waiting a little longer  food if the food and service is worth it. Unfortunately, the food fell short of mediocre.

It was late and nice outside so we decided to talk a walk to Paisan's and try it for the first time.\n\nWhat do you do when you need to celebrate? You order champagne. We ordered 25 dollar champagne. We got ... a BOTTLE OF COOK'S. Really?? REALLY? If you are going to serve us cheap champagne, fine, but at LEAST be smart enough to get something no one will recognize! What's more, while the waiter was nice and all, he wasted tons of our champagne. He didn't pour it right so it fizzed all kinds and he kept spilling it. THANKS. That was our 25 dollar bottle of effin' Cook's you just wasted.\n\nWe tried to move on, and order an appetizer. It's pretty much bread and cheese, or bread and cheese. Or bread and garlic. Cool. It was fine, but nothing special.\n\nThe pizzas were also fine, but nothing special. I got vegetarian pesto, Derek got the spicy one. I think these people are relying WAYYYY too much on their name, their legacy, and crappy Kraft cheese.  Way too much cheese. Really good cheese can be used in just the right amount for perfect flavor -- if you add a ton of bland, poor quality cheese to something, that's not going to make it suddenly taste better!!!\n\nDesserts? Meh. Derek was horrified to find the tiramisu cut like a pie slice and not a square. (he's picky)\n\nIt was a pretty building. The acoustics in the back room, the one overlooking the \""lake\"" (read: freeway) are terrible though. Also, it's dirty. The floors were covered.\n\nI'm thinking ... never again. Not worth my close-to-90 dollars. And it ruined our celebration. I really wish we had gone somewhere else.",0.0,0.9996578693389891

There are friendly hostesses seating you on time for your reservation in a beautifully appointed dining room, a nice drink/wine list, and an interesting menu.  However, the execution is terrible or at least it was for our dinner experience on a Friday night.\n\nFirst of all, we were seated or crammed into a table about a foot and a half away from people on each side.  Second, we did not get our drinks for fifteen minutes and did not even get water for ten.  When our waiter finally appeared, he told us how busy he was and tried to get sympathy because some old man was demanding.  Okay, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until I asked him a question about the menu and his answer was, \""You know, I am going to have come back because I really need to wait on that table.\""  So much for us sitting there not being helped for fifteen minutes...ugh.\n\nWith regards to the food, it was above average.  The bread and olive tapenade was commendable.  The boston bibb salad fell in the alright category.  The true winner for us was the portobello flatbread.  I can imagine that if I would have had a salad and flatbread for lunch, I would probably be writing a much better review.  Then, my husband had the risotto special and I had the halibut.  The fish was flaky and quite tasty, but I could not even dent it, it was so large.  The risotto was undercooked and lacked pizazz.\n\nAll in all, a disappointing experience and not one living up to the name or price of Todd English.

By the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded. We asked for another table and were seated at a banquette. The server arrived, but acted as if he was not expecting company. \nThe best experience was with the sommelier, whose name unfortunately I cannot remember. He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).\nMy partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).  The burger was terrific, the fries however, were over salted(I am a salt lover, so really too much) and frankly pretty ordinary. \nNow to my Cioppino, first, it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked, no, really. I could not believe it, also, the temperature of the whole dish was off. The \""broth\"" which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough, too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting. The combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good. I only ate the lobster tail and the scallop(also not cooked correctly). The sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was (the server never returned to ask). I asked him if he really wanted to know and I told him about the above. I saw him tell the server, who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets (the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like Sharon's.) \nOverall, I would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again.
