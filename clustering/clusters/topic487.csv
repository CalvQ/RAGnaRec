I placed an order for delivery: cashew chicken with white rice, fried wontons, and egg drop soup. The whole order cost around $13 with free delivery. The lady on the phone was nice and the delivery guy seemed alright, too.\n\nOnce I received my food, I was severely disappointed. It was greasy and most of the food was cold. I started with the wontons, which had zero filling and the accompanying sauce had the consistency of jelly. So I put that aside for the egg drop soup. The soup was yellow, thick, and cold. It pretty much looked like they just whisked a bunch of egg yolks and called it a day. I hoped the chicken entree was at least partially decent, but I was again disappointed. The chicken AND the cashews were soggy (how does one make soggy cashews? I've never encountered this before), while the rice that came with it was cold and hard.

When it arrived to the table both of us were completely blown away by the powerful odor.  It looked beautiful.  There were small pieces of white white chicken piled next to a wedge of pale cabbage.  Small spears of red onion stuck out like cactus.  But the smell was overwhelming- and not it was not good.  It reeked with a sourness that I assumed was just an element or spice that I had not ever experienced before.  I thought, if this is a \""bad\"" smell as if the chicken had expired then why was the server seeming unmoved?  I tried removing the onions thinking perhaps they were the culprit, but it did not help.  The putrid fumes just would not stop-literally causing me to gag.  I felt horrible when I tried explaining to the server that it was not what we were expecting and apologizing for asking him to please remove it from the table.  He was very polite and offerred to make another without onions.  It was too late, as we were unable to remove the smell from our memory.  The rest of the meal was deliscious as usual.\nStill wondering what created that sulfuric odor.  Black Beets?",0.0,0.9953263998031616
