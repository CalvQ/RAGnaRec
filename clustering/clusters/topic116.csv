I scheduled an appointment for her to come to my house to measure and bring me some samples.  On the day of the appointment she called to tell me that she did not have the samples with her but she did want to come by and measure and see the other flooring in my house to try and match.  When she got to my house, she kept mentioning a tile which looked like wood- which I told her specifically that I did not want tile.\nThen when she told me her pricing ($3/sq ft) for installation.  I told her that she was double the price of others.  She explained that her company has to hire a subcontractor and then still make a profit.  So- they are basically a middle man.  \nShe then stated that she would come back the next day and bring some samples.  She never showed up or called.

From the start things ran smoothly. They gave me a fair quote and showed up on time to all appointments. The floors went in smoothly and looked great. Why the two stars? Well the job was never really finished. We had Scotts take out about two inches thick of satillo tile and repaced with hardwood flooring. We have a fireplace with same flooring. They took it out for us as well and replaced it with a different tile that matched the floors. The replacement tile had very sharp edges and i have a baby so I asked them to round the edges or something. They said they had done all that was paid for and washed their hands of the issue. Which was true, the fireplace was not included in the original quote and i told them I would pay to have it completed well, but I think they had other projects to move onto and were done with me. After several no return calls i gave up and sought my own solutions. On top of that the installer left several gaps in the flooring between the cabinets and the wood. They came in to fix it, but their fixing the gap looked messy and they still missed lots of spots that were never completed. I eventually gave up trying to get their help. They had their money and were done with my needs. My floors looked great and if you're not taking out two inches worth of satillo tile you probably won't have the gap issues we had and they'll probably do a good job.

That was our first mistake because that was the start of a year long battle with no good ending. The carpet people first measured wrong and was trying to order almost double the amount of carpet we needed. We also tiled the bathrooms and kitchen at the same time so we spent a pretty penny to begin with. After much argueing with the people who measure about how they had come to doubled the measurements they conceeded and remeasured correctly. Then came the lovely installation of the carpet and tile. They put the wrong grout color while installing the tile and had to dye the grout to fix it. The carpet was not istalled correctly either leaving huge wrinkly spots all over the house which are there to this day:( I spent almost a year dealing with them to come and fix the carpet and everytime they said there was nothing to do besides purchase all new carpet and redo. In the end to get rid of us they gave us a 300 dollar gift card and told us to have a nice day.

My rating is stricly based on the crew's professionalism.  Here's my story;\n\nI was a co-signer for may daughters rental condo and upon her moving out, she left the carpert filthy. for two years she lived in, she never really picked up any spills and left the carpet heavily stained with black marks all over the house. Although the floor was very bad, I though it could be saved because the stain were mostly from spilled drink and food (maybe some pet stains too), and not from paint, dyes, or red wine.\n\nI called Stanley Steemer and they quoted me a reasonable price for a 2-bderoom condo.  They promised to come the next day between 1 and 4 and the crew were on time at 2 pm.  The entire condo was already empty and ready for carpet cleaning.  The crew grabbed their supplies , headed to the condo, walked in, very briefly looked at the carpet, then walked right back out towards their van.  They informed us that they could not clean my carpet under those filty conditions and that the carpet was \""hopeless\"".\n\nI called the Stanley Steemer to give steam cleaning a try.  With rave reviews on the internet, I thought they would do a good job.  But instead, they left me pissed off.  Although I was not expecting miracles, I wanted the carpet just a little more presentable than how it was.  A half-clean place would do, I thought. But instead, the crew didn't even bother inspecting the carpet and see what the stains were made of.  They only assumed it was uncleanable.  Personally, I thought they were just too lazy to do the extra effort.  It was unprofessional of the crew to just leave without giving us any definite reason why they couldn't clean the carpet.\n\nI called the HQ and complained about the situation.  The company said that they won't do heavily stained carpets but they would get back to me.  I thought that was crazy because this was supposed to be a professional company.\n\nSo right away, I called another local company in Las Vegas.  Another company, J2 Cleaning  was not only willing to help out, but their crew did an OUTSTANDING job cleaning the entire carpet.  It was beyond my expectations....and they charged me less than Stanley. It took J2 just 30 minutes longer than average to clean my place, but they cleaned it and did a wonderful job.\n\nSo my thoughts were confirmed.  The Stanley crew that showed up that day were just lazy bunch of losers and only wanted to tackle easy jobs. I'm sure Stanley is a good company over all coming from other comments, but the impression from their crew made me think otherwise.\n\nStanley just lost business from me...and any business in the future because I will not recommend this company to anyone based on the crew's unprofessionalism.",0.0,0.9990315437316896

I looked them up on the internet and found they're 3 room special for $129.95 but as I really, needed my bedroom, loft, stairs and an area rug cleaned I called them to find out what I would be charged for those areas. The woman I spoke with told me the area rug, which I wasn't sure what the exact size was at the time I spoke with her, would be charged 25 cents a square foot, but the actual charge would be determined when the technician was onsite (the rug is 10 ft by 12 ft) that makes it $30. So I was okay with this, what I wasn't okay with was that although I pointed out to her the areas that I needed cleaned, bedroom, loft, stairs area rug, she never mentioned the stairs are charged at $5 per stair and the small 11ft x 4ft landing area would be counted as a room so my $129.95 3 room special turned into a huge $259.95 carpet cleaning bill!! I was totally blindsided!\nMy carpets are not that old, about 2 1/2 years, the area rug is a year and a half old, I don't have a lot of traffic through my home as I live alone so the carpets had virtually no stains or heavy traffic areas. \nNow here's my biggest complaint the area rug looks like it hasn't been touched and they've cleaned it twice now! They like to blame it on the quality of the rug, it's a poor quality rug (I paid $600 for it, it's not a poor quality rug) so we can't get all the dirt out!! Say that again? Well how often are you vacuuming your rug? Really!!! Hate to say this but I think after 2 tries the rug should look a lot cleaner and brighter, (it's cream colored) and it took a lot longer than 2 hours both times to dry, overnight both times before the rug dried, it was saturated!! I think Zerorez is in over their head when they have a specialty rug to clean! \nDespite my many complaints both about the bill and the quality of the work Zerorez has refused to adjust my bill.

I asked to have my sofa done and they said they would have to quote it in person which I understood,  they wanted $120. I dont think this is a fair price. So I skipped that. They also did not show up at the time scheduled.  When I called the supervisor told me she was not aware of her competitor's prices and didnt seem to care that things were not consistent with what was scheduled. Hopefully the no chemical part makes up for it!!!",0.0,0.9992846846580504

At the walk-through (just before we closed) we were told that all the tile grout in the master bath, laundry room, and bath two was being \""re-injected\"" because there was a defect or something with the install.  We moved in one week later and the morning after we moved in, I noticed that the grout in the master bathroom was beginning to crumble, and the tiles were coming loose!  I put in a work request, and shortly afterward I noticed that the grout in bath two and the laundry room were also crumbling.  I waited three long weeks for an appointment (due to a mix-up of some sort) and when they finally did come out to rip out all the floors and to reinstall, they left the toilet inside the bathtub in bath two, completely messed up the paint on my baseboards in the laundry room, and they left the carpet peeled back exposing the tack-strips!  My two little girls are always running around my home and they could have been seriously injured had they stepped on or fallen on those exposed tacks!  I was told that all would be repaired after they were done with the entire job, but I am highly doubtful.

We had our home built so that everything would be in NEW CONDITION, and we would not have to worry about home repairs for a while.  Now we have been dealing with this crap for the entire first month in our new home!!!  We had no choice in the flooring company chosen because they were contracted with Dunhill homes (our builder) in Tuscany Village (our community), but I would definitely strongly recommend they go with someone else.  I am glad we have a warranty because I am willing to bet we will have more trouble with our flooring in the very near future.  Reading the other reviews on this flooring company, one would think that builders would avoid them at all costs, but they must be the cheapest of the flooring companies because they are still getting contracts. If anyone is thinking about purchasing in Tuscany Village or anywhere else that Floor Designs of Nevada will be doing the flooring work, I would strongly recommend insisting that they allow you to choose a different flooring company.",0.0,0.9995505213737488

There would be plenty of time for the carpet to dry before the kids came home.\nAfterward, the carpet was cleaner, but I was disappointed that it didn't get nearly as clean as the last cleaners had. Since we have carpet that is guaranteed not to stain, everything always comes out when it is professionally cleaned. We had no stains or major spots - just general traffic dirt - and he didn't even get all of that out. We discovered a week or so later that he hadn't even bothered to clean the carpet on the other side of my son's bed (which is about 3 feet from the wall, so there is plenty of space). We got new beds, and now there is a big dirty streak along the wall where the carpets weren't cleaned. There were also some very minor spots in the master bedroom that didn't come clean and didn't even much lighter, even though they weren't dark to begin with. \nThe carpet was very wet after he finished, and it wasn't nearly dry after 5 hours - even with the ceiling fans and a box fan blowing on them! I had to put towels down on the carpet in places after the kids got home to keep them from walking on wet carpet.

I hired Heaven's Best to clean carpet and tile for my home.  \n\nTile Job\nThey did a good job with the tile.  Just make sure to feel the tile before they leave.  They did my bathrooms by hand and  there was a film left on them.  I let Darnell know and they wiped the floors down again to clear away the film.  The area in which they used the machine turned out good.  I keep my floors pretty clean and was hoping that they would get a few of the tough spots out.   They got most of it out however, note that some of the tough spots may get lightened and not removed.\n\nCarpet Cleaning\nAs for the carpet cleaning I was rather disappointed.  The first time they came out we reviewed the area prior to cleaning and I was told that the spots on my carpet would be removed.  After they had completed the carpet there were still spots.  I was told that the carpet would look better once dry.  They had relayed that the carpet would be dry in about an hour.  Well, 2 days later...  I still had damp carpet.  I called Darnell to inform him that I was unhappy with the job due to the remaining spots and that my semi-dry carpet was now hard.  He offered to come back and clean the carpet again.  \n\nUpon their revisit I pointed out the spots that were still dark and Darnell said that he would clean the entire area again.  The spots were removed this time however, they did not redo the entire area.  They actually didn't touch 1 of the 2 bedrooms and the carpet is still hard in both the original and redone areas.  It is more than likely the solution they use.  I have a feeling that the first team used too much cleaning solution which left my carpet wet for 3 days and the 2nd visit did nothing to make the situation any better hence...  hard carpet.  \n\nIf you're going to use Heaven's Best I would probably make sure that Darnell is the one doing the work and I would check everything before you let them leave.  I unfortunately am going to have to hire someone else to come and redo the carpets.  :(",0.0,0.9952349066734314

Darnell and two other guys came by and gave me a quote and it was very fair and I was excited to see my hardwood floors shine. I made the appointment and assumed Darnell would be doing the job but two other guys showed up which was fine by me as long as the job got done. When they were almost done I saw a huge scratch that they had made when they moved one of our chairs. They weren't going to fix it until I spoke up and mentioned it. Next the kitchen area that has the most traffic had some pretty bad spots that Darnell showed us would come up or at least be less noticeable which I was super excited about. When the guys were about done I looked in the kitchen and noticed none of the bad spots that Darnell had said he would spend extra time on were even the tiniest bit lighter. I asked the guys to go over it again and the spots came up so it seems like it was just pure laziness that they didn't want to put in the extra effort (it only took about 15 extra min of their time) If I wouldn't have asked those spots and the huge scuff mark from them would still be there. Once they left I started to notice corners and other parts of the floor have dust and haven't even been wiped down, I understand not being able to get the buffer in those spaces but not even wiping it?! The floors look decent now but I don't think I would be using them again unless it was guaranteed that Darnell would be doing the job.

I was surprised to find that the person at Floors and Decor who recommended them to me actually worked for them and came to do the measurement, this is a fact that should have been disclosed to me.  I had already done a measurement and estimated high and purchased the tile needed.  The salespeson at Floor and Decor added to my estimate based on a pattern that he recommended when I stated that I wanted splashes of color.  He also measured my counters for granite. He stated that he would email me the contract so I could review it.  He never emailed me the contract but did phone me at work to go over the estimate.  It was high for the pattern and so he took that out and met me at the house to sign the contract.  Afer I signed the contract I figured out I was paying close to $3.00 per square foot for a straight 20\"" tile installation.  I found I could do better and called the company to cancel the contract.  Tristan, the owner invited me to his showhouse and spoke to me about options.  They were going to send me a revised contract with the new options, never did. Although I was told when I purchased the tile that it would be in within 7-10 days, after two weeks I was told it would be received within a \""week or so\"".  I ended up picking out different tile and needed less tile because I was no longer doing a pattern. Da Vinci Green was supposed to remove and tile all the rooms EXCEPT the kitchen and bathrooms. When I dropped off some boxes on day 2 of the installation, I peeked in the kitchen and noticed that my kitchen tile   had been removed and new tile installed!  At this time I walked through the house and noticed that they still had quite a bit of tile to install and only had 1 box left.  I called the company and Connie (very helpful) had my contact (Aaron) call me.  Aaron apologized and stated that they would not charge me for the tile installation for the kitchen! Really!  They weren't supposed to install in the kitchen in the first place.  But because they were so generously going to install the kitchen tile for free, they wanted me to purchase 400 sq ft more of tile from Floor and Decor to finish the job!  Aaron got the price of the tile down to $500, but I should not have been forced to purchase additional tile to cover their mistake.  I was forced to return my accent color to pay for the additional tile needed to finish the job.  Any reputable company would have done the right thing, not only install for free but also purchase the additional tiles needed to finish the job.  They were TOTALLY at fault.

I was first pleasantly surprised at the pricing.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money but wanted to put something durable in.  I initially was looking at 8 mm laminate since it was so cheap at .49 sq ft. My sales associate, Jeffrey, showed me some 12 mm laminate for .99 (it was around 1.38 everywhere else I looked) and said this would hold up between tenants and in the long run be cheaper than repairing or replacing.  After seeing the difference and realizing it was about $700 difference I figured it was worth the difference.  But since I ended up paying more than what I initially expected (since I was going cheap) they told me about the interest free credit card.  Then I met the manager, Joleen, who was very kind and helpful.  The approval gave me 12 months interest free and she said if I came back after thanksgiving she could get it changed to 15 months.  I was taken back that she had offered and was really trying to help me spread out the payments.  I went back yesterday to pick up my last items that were on back order and she remembered me and took care of getting it pushed to 15 months.  While she was on the phone, I heard her tell the company that she understood it was a $25 charge.  I would have paid it but she never said a word and just took care of it. While I waited she was helping another client with a return and again went out of her way to get her what she needed and still giving her the discount that was no longer valid.  I've never been treated so good in a retail store with everyone trying to help me get the best deal.  I'm doing another house in March and will again go back to floor & d\u00e9cor.

We had looked around at Home Depot and Lowe's but because of the commercials I wanted to try out Empire.\n\nOur first mistake was not getting estimates from other companies.  When the sales person got to our house (BOB BLANKENSHIP) he was pretty pushy and made it really difficult for both my husband and myself to politely say that we needed to get more estimates.  I knew that I wanted to get more quotes when the dude said that it would cost us $2,500 to carpet three bedrooms (2 rooms are 9'10\"" x 9\""10\"" while our master is 16' x 13').  I had never bought carpet before but I was pretty sure that three rooms would run us somewhere around $1,000.  Mistake #2 was not kicking the salesman out the front door for being pushy and obnoxious. \n\nBOB BLANKENSHIP did his part by bad-mouthing the competition instead of selling how great their product is (because it's CRAP!) but my hubs and I thought that we were paying for quality.\n\nWe have four cats and wanted something that was extremely stain resistant and would be able to withstand a cat scratch here and there.  We are VERY tidy people.  We leave the doors closed when we aren't in the rooms, I vacuum every 5-6 days, we spot clean the SECOND something hits the carpet, and we never wear shoes or go barefoot (because we were told the oils from our feet would dirty it up).  Plus, it's just the two of us- no children.  Our carpet should be IMMACULATE- BUT IT'S NOT!!!!!\n\nI am SO PISSED at the quality of our carpet. The carpet cleaner that was here today said that he assumed our carpet was 5 years old!!!  Plus he said- despite that JERKS assertions- that the carpet we have has NEVER BEEN TREATED FOR STAIN RESISTANCE!!!!  Pardon my french, but THAT FUCKER SAID IT HAD BEEN TREATED TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNow I'm perusing thru trying to find warranty info on this crap so I can get it replaced!!!!!!!\n\nI wish that I could make this next part bigger and bolder.

(There were differences in the single/center male edge protrusion...some round and others square/rectangular.  One can mix the two diff. edge patterns BUT you will not get a good fitting of adjacent tiles.  I will try to attach a photo of the problem patterns to this review.  Why in tarnation this firm sends out two (2) diff. patterns (or even has same) is beyond me.  In summary, if you get two diff. edge patterns, contact firm and get enough replacements so you end up with all one (1) pattern.  This may seem like a needless delay, resolving edge pattern BUT worth resolving BEFORE laying your tiles.  Trust me!\n2.  Along with the examination in #1 above, carefully examine the overall face of ea. tile (tilting same to light source--there will most assuredly be a couple of what looks like \""scratched lines/flaws\"" that run across the surface of ea. tile.  This firm says such are within manufacturing tolerances....I say they are flaws and you shall forever note same in your finished floor.\n3.  While you are laying tiles, I suggest you rotate ea. tile (same side face up) to determine if tiles appear lighter or darker (overall shade color) in comparison to adjoining tiles. Rotate to have tile appear best/similar with your normal lighting and viewing position of the flooring.  Note: Rubber Flooring firm excludes surface reflection etc.  under warranty...so worth your time to get ea. tile laid best possible.\n4.  These \""WATER JET CUT\"" tiles (COST EXTRA) are advertised as:  \""...they appear virtually seamless (unlike the many die cut tile options available\"".  In reality, these tiles do NOT fit well at all...many joints are readily visible! \n5.  In Conclusion:  I would not purchase subject tiles again.

The very day I called him he drove 40 miles to come & look at my carpeting!!! Who is this guy - same day service, nice, prompt, well groomed & yes, he is happy! Anyway, this carpet is in a rental I own and the renter was in there for 7 years. He moved in with 3 boys and periodically moved his brother (& his brother's kids) in and out and a few years ago, he remarried. Did I mention that the bride had 2 teenagers? Woops, almost forgot the dog! In all that time, they never cleaned the carpet. So, now they are gone & I really thought that nothing could be done for the poor, abused carpeting & that I should just put it out of its misery. It truly was utterly disgusting.  But Jack said he was sure he could hugely improve it, and the price he quoted me was so unbelievable that I figured I had to give it a try. So today he showed up & told me to give him about 3 hours, so I left to run errands. When I came back 3 hours later he wasn't quite done so I left again. Altogether it took him 4 hours BUT I absolutely know that it was because the carpet was so horrid & he was determined to transform it. Did he complain? Give up? Ask me for more money? No, no and no. He just worked his tail off till it was done and done superbly. I was truly amazed at what I came home to. I actually wrote him a check for MORE than the agreed upon price because he doesn't even charge enough in the first place! Then to top it off he completely floors me (floors me - get it? LOL). I had forgotten what color the carpeting actually was and it was sooooo clean & fresh that I secretly was wondering if somehow he had magically installed new carpeting while I was gone (I watch all that conspiracy theory stuff). I am so grateful that there are still businesses around that have these kind of work ethics and integrity and I hope he gets a TON of business and becomes very rich & blessed because he really, really deserves that. Thank you Jack. Oh, one more thing, At first I thought the \""Happy\"" in the name of the company was a description of him and I still do.

After doing a little research for a company with decent prices and good reviews, I decided to go with Personal Touch. Honestly ecofriendliness wasn't a concern and I don't have any known sensitivities to cleaners, but I was informed by the property managers that the person moving in after me was sensitive to certain things. I gave them the info for Personal Touch and I guess they checked out. I don't know exactly what they were looking for but just an fyi for other people who are sensitive that this may be a good option. They quoted me something like $79 as a special offer going on at the time. Sweet price!\n\nI believe a day or so in advance they called to confirm my appointment and price, and said that since they had changed computer systems they did not have my original quote. They gave me the price of about $109, and honestly I knew that it had been lower, but I was in the middle of moving and not willing to dig everywhere to find that quote. It wasn't a huge price difference but the principle of it slightly irritated me. Oh well.\n\nThe day came and the gentleman showed up a bit early, and told me it would be about 1 hour to clean my 1 bedroom, roughly 700 square foot apartment. I left and came back about 45 min later to find him finishing up. The carpet looked great, even though he had told me it was very lightly soiled, and he said it would take x amount of time to dry and gave me plastic covers for my shoes.\n\nOverall the service was great, both in customer service and the actual job. The price thing was a bit of a peeve but the service was very friendly both over the phone and in person. I would use them again and have my quoted price handy next time!",1.0,0.8708919286727905

I'm sure that there are better companies to go through, and I will be using them next time. \n\nWe chose this company because it was recommended to us by our apartment complex. We called two days ahead of time, and were told someone would be there to clean the carpets between 12-5 on our chosen day. Sort of a big window, but whatever. \n\nOn the day, we called around 2 to see if they had any idea when someone would be coming. We were told someone would be there by 4. At 4:05, with still not carpet people, we called again, and were told, it will be another 40 minutes. At 4:35, we received a call saying it would actually be another 45 minutes. At this point, we were getting pretty unhappy that we had sat around for the carpet cleaners all day, and they were not not even showing up in the 5 hour window we'd been given. We called the company back to complain, and the woman on the phone snapped at us that \""it isn't even 5 yet\"" refused to consider giving us a discount, and basically said she didn't care that we would be relaying this information to our apartment complex. \n\nAround 5:45, the carpet people finally showed up. Two men came in, quickly assessed the place, and got to work. I will give one star to the man who actually cleaned the carpets. He worked hard, and did a great job. I have no complaints about him. His partner, on the other hand, was literally on the phone the entire time he was at our apartment, and besides briefly spraying the some kind of chemical out of a spray bottle here and there, he basically did nothing, and was not needed for the job. Maybe if those two guys split up, and worked separately, they could been on time. Apparently, two people were not necessary for the job. \n\nOne other benefit was the price. It was $50 to do an entire two bedroom apartment. I will say it was a good price, and if you are on a super tight budget and can take the entire day to wait for these guys to show up, this might not be a bad choice for you. But overall, with the waiting, the overtly rude treatment on the phone, and watching one hard working guy who something tells me doesn't get paid as much as the dude who spent the whole time on the phone, I have to pass on this place for next time, and try someone else who is a little more professional.",0.0,0.9994058609008788

I called another company and availability was only Saturdays for both parties and so I had a 1 day window to work with. First time, they called me to reschedule because they overbooked. (ok I guess I can wait ONE more week) Second week, something came up on my end and was unavailable so I had to reschedule on them. (Two weeks, my hounds are starting to think it's ok to urinate indoors) Week three, they were able to arrive (2 hrs late at that) and just to break it to me that they couldn't honor my quoted price (which was fine) but they didn't have enough hose to even complete the job. (Now 4 weeks is too long for me, but I had no choice but to reschedule) I got Scrub Bud's number through a friend and immediately booked for that same Saturday. They arrived on time, prepared and could not have done a better job. They put so much effort into taking care of my needs and really pushed through to do a fantastic job and I would recommend them to everyone.

(He was also really good with my little dog that was very curious and probably getting in his way!)  In an hour, he had set up and cleaned the carpet in the closet, the hallway around the closet, and our nursery and literally removed every single spot.  He let me know when he was done and was packed up and out the door with a smile.  I will be using Mr. Clean Carpet Care again in the near future as we are remodeling and I'm planning to clean all of the light beige carpets in our home.

I went with him to his car to show him what i wanted and he had a great sample in the color I had in my head!

The product is great but the installation was terrible. They left gaps I could run a credit card through. I one room the left a repeating H pattern. In the 2nd room they used small boards mainly, as if left overs from another installation. They put 3 12 inch boards smack dab in the center of the living room with seems so close together. There are places glue sticks up and the molding was not straight. The customer service was even worse. First they came back to my home and insulted me by saying it's supposed to be like that. I showed them the crooked lifted molding and the sprayed black caulking in the gap. They did the same in the gaps. If you knock on the floor it sounds hollow in large areas as if not adhered to the concrete. Next they sent out a quality control person that told me it needed to be replaced or compensated for, he said he would speak to his manager to take care of it. The manager called and said his guy told him yes there were gaps but he believed we were both ignorant to the product and that the seems were because it is beveled. I told him the gaps were lengthwise, so 12\"" and some 4ft along the edges. I sent him 50 photos of all the problems I even took a 5 ft long vertical blind slat and ran it through the gap and it stood up on its own. Finally he said since he did not agree he was hiring a professional to do a private inspection. Funny she came but left me no card or credentials so for all I know she probably worked for Empire. I tried calling my salesman and all he said is that's not how Empire does business. Well obviously it is so save yourself the time and headache and money and go someplace else. I canceled my 5000.00 carpet order that was back ordered thank God or I imagine I would be still trying to get someone to address the problem. I asked for a refund or replacement and I am still waiting months later. Very unprofessional and shady conduct. The man who came out and agreed with me was supposed to be on a conference call to discuss his findings but funny he was never available, I just got the info second hand, and nothing in writing. What a joke. The installers and the so called manager should be fired!

I have a solution that I use that is far more superior than anything he had. I just needed my carpet cleaned so I could use it. He had that stuff u buy @ any store that doesn't work. After trying 2 argue w/ me 4 several minutes he finally relented. They got to work & it took longer 4 me 2 move my furniture out of the way than they took 2 clean my carpets.

He explained they try to boost sales even if there is virtually no mark-up. Okay, I thought. Seems somewhat logical...I guess.\n\nSo I go in to RC Willey and meet a sales rep. She has me look at tons of samples and has me pick like 10. After 30 mins of this, I ask if these are the promotional Stainmaster carpets. She assures me everything is on sale. Im suspicious but I play along.\n\nFinally I have her quote me for one sample I liked. Mind you its 3 bedrooms and less than 600 total sq feet. The price: $3300. Like as in $1100 per average size 10x10 bedroom I ask, and she says \""yes' with a straight face. So I ask what is really on a good sale like as described in the flyer? She explains the samples with a black dot is what is on special (like why didn't she say this at first?). So out of 1000's of samples like 12 have the black dot (if you can find them).\n\nOf course the samples on sale are the ugliest. Drab grays and browns and cheap materials. One was dark burgundy with rose pattens, I kid you not. \n\nI am annoyed and ask for a quote for the least of the ugly cheap sample I can find. Price: $1700. Plus I will have to move all my own furniture. I call around to multiple carpet dealers in town (there are tons) and get quotes for hundreds of dollars less, some almost half of these prices.\n\nLong story short, RC Willey uses gimmicks and the old bait and switch to get people in the store.

I bought a Groupon and it was honored with no nonsense about extra dough for trip charges, deodorizers, Scotchgard and stain removers. They just cleaned my carpets professionally - no negotiations.

There are other tile stores in town that carry much of the same merchandise, and their staff was much more helpful at helping me find items in their stores that they thought would meet what I was looking for.  I had to aggressively engage the sales girl here twice during my visit just to get some attention.  If I had a couple weeks to wait for the other stores to order my tile, I would have saved about half and been treated better.  Mexican Tile & Stone had what I wanted in stock, so I paid full retail prices to get it.  Paying such a premium I mistakenly thought I'd get a premium product, but much of it had serious paint and/or glazing defects requiring me to rifle through the supply in their warehouse to get tiles that didn't look significantly different from each other.  Before this last step, the sales girl had made sure to have me sign TWO waivers about these being hand-made tiles and that I should expect variations.  Variation is one thing, and in the QC world variation has an acceptable tolerance range. Many of the tiles they tried to send home with me were downright defective and unquestionably outside any range of acceptable variation.  There weren't enough of the \""good\"" tiles for my project, so I took a few of the best of the bad and had my tile installer mix them in the project so they weren't so visible.  However, I notice them every time I look at it and it really bugs me I spent full retail for these tiles.  Definitely a lesson learned by me - build enough time in a project to pick out materials from a different tile store and have them ordered.",0.0,0.9994637370109558
