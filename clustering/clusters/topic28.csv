I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\n\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \n\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \n\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.\n\nFor brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!\n\nNow I just need to make plans to go back for dinner.",1.0,0.9994020462036132

The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy. \n\nI have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something.

Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree.

Came here for Sunday brunch with a coupla buddies.  Was disappointed at the brunch foods available and the service.\n\nFood - nothing really stands out, which I guess I should expect considering it is a brunch buffet.  That being said, the bar should not be set so low for any restaurant, and they should not be aiming for the status quo.  .  What's up with the tapa-style fish taco? Didn't know you could put canned tuna in a shell and call it a day.  Or what about their grits?  It was more like dried-out mashed potato looking at the viscosity of it.  Would really like them to step up their food quality, even if it is buffet-style.  Been to plenty of really great brunch buffet places, like the Castaways brunch in Burbank, CA.  \n\nService - Hostess was really awkward when we walked in and didn't immediately greet us or ask what we needed--maybe she was new.  The wait was beyond 30 minutes which is understandable.  The other hostess, who was bubblier, asked for our number bc we were going to wander around Phillips Place and told us that she would call when we could be seated.  We returned a little early and just sat outside waiting for a phone call.  She popped her head outside, \""Oh, didn't know you guys were going to just be waiting outside, you can come inside and I'll seat you.\""  The problem was that she was more surprised that we were there.  She should have DEFINITELY called us like she said she would.  To catch us on happenstance outside makes me think that we were not a priority, or that she was not going to call us.  Gotta follow up immediately when you extend extra service like that.\n\nDishes weren't cleared at a fast enough rate.  Seriously though, it's not like brunch is a new concept at Upstream.  I'm sure the service staff can identify plates that need to be cleared because guests are reloading.  Chaos as some plates were taken while others were left--looking at the plate clear selection, no rhyme or reason it seems.  Empty plates left, while some with left over food taken, etc.  \n\nGave this place a second shot, but unimpressed.\n\ndmo out",0.0,0.9987757802009584

Aside from that, the mass prepared food is pretty average. The breads and dessert are below average, since they are both dry and flavorless.

The menu is seafood heavy and we wound up ordering calamari and mussels to share. The tomato sauce for the mussels was some of the best that I have had in a long time. The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari.\n\nFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \""Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\"" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette.

Cooks - it was a really nice place.  I am really glad I read the other Yelpers' suggestions before I went.  It is a must to order an entree and get the buffet as an add-on.  That is a no-brainer.  I'm not sure who came up with their pricing for the brunch/entrees, but it was a bit strange - same price to order an entree with the buffet as ordering just the buffet.  Huh.  Anyhow, the banana stuffed french toast was pretty good - a little dry, but good.  One of my other friends ordered the apple and brie french toast - it looked drenched in sauce, but she said it was good.  My other friend ordered the salmon - he liked it, but didn't care for the skin left on the salmon.  The buffet was good if you plan to eat a ton of crab legs and shrimp.  The salads are good, but the selection is very small.  The omelet guy makes a really good omelet.  Other than that, the buffet is somewhat unimpressive.  I should have passed on the buffet.  I mostly enjoy buffets for their delicious desserts, and this dessert spread was completely uninspired.  The creme brulee was not cooked all the way and the cannoli was just okay.   The other desserts were just okay, too - nothing to remember.  So... my suggestion is to just order an entree and skip the buffet, unless you are famished and want to stuff yourself - then, go for it!  It was pricey, so be prepared for the bill! I probably won't go back for awhile to eat.  However, I did stop in the reception for the hotel after brunch and asked to see a casita. They were very accommodating and had a bellman show us a casita room fairly quickly.  The room was nice, but the view was really nice!  The pool areas are very well maintained.

They kindly accommodated this request (made through a Yelp reservation). Unfortunately, the blinds didn't do a great job of blocking sunlight into a diner's eyes and the space was kind of chilly near the windows. I will say that the front window area feels more contemporary than perhaps the rest of the space, which feels like an old house. I like the front for that reason.\n\nFood: We were there for brunch and the food was pretty underwhelming. The whole grain Belgian waffle was terribly bland. The bacon was delicious (ask for it extra-crispy!) and the grits dish looked good and my family member confirmed as much. The omelette was OK said the birthday boy - nothing terribly out of the ordinary.\n\nBeverages: We did not partake since it was not yet noon on a Sunday, but I saw mimosas on the menu and would have enjoyed that.

This is a casual place where anyone should feel comfortable in everyday attire.

But how about the Oscar Benedict?  The eggs are served on crabcakes with asparagus and bearnaise sauce.   Delicious.  Omelette?  Good.  But how about a Mashed Potato Omelette with cheese, bacon, scallions, and sour cream?  Even better.  Got a sweet tooth for breakfast?  Try the Bananas Foster French Toast.  You'll feel the cavities creeping up on you as you take bite after delicious bite.  \n\nOne of the highlights of a Pewter Rose brunch has got to be the complimentary hot butterscotch scones that are brought to your table while you're waiting for your entrees.

He listened to my complaint and allowed me to order another meal, the Eggs Benedict with a side of cheese grits. When my plate arrived I was very excited. The meal looked fantastic. Then, it was love at first bite. The cheese grits are the best grits ever. I shared half with my sister because i wanted her to get \""the experience\"". lol I ate my meal slowly so I could savor it.

That's how I felt after Easter brunch yesterday at Arcadia Farms. We decided to go to Arcadia Farms for brunch on Easter, having made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance. We decided on this restaurant because it was somewhere new to take my Grandma, but mainly because they advised us they would be serving their regular menu at slightly higher prices, not doing a buffet. Needless to say, I was surprised when we arrived and regular menu was NOT available and there was a $20 brunch buffet. Since neither my Husband or myself are eating bread, this posed a problem considering basically it was pastries and omelets for the buffet. Well, since we were there and my Grandma is disabled, we really couldn't just pick up and go to another restaurant leaving us paying over $60 for not very much food. \n\nI felt like the servers were extremely apathetic and not very pleasant. They sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant when clearly my Grandma was not walking well and would need to go all the way to the front for their buffet. They moved us after we asked and then we sat on the patio, which is very nice as previous reviews have said. The food was mediocre. The best part was the bacon, which was exceptionally good for buffet bacon. \n\nHaving been here before for my Birthday a few years ago and remembering it fondly, I was very disappointed in this most recent experience.

There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.

Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.

For a seemingly busy weekend, it wasn't crowded in the restaurant at all and we were promptly seated. Because I was so excited to go here for brunch, I already searched through pictures on Yelp for the best looking brunch since I knew I'd be super indecisive if I didn't (thanks Yelp!)\n\nWe got:\n\nQuiche du Jour- my choice, it's always quiche florentine (spinach) served with a side salad. One bite in and I was literally speechless. It was the FLUFFIEST, LIGHTEST, most DELICIOUS quiche I have ever tasted in my life. Caps lock does not convey well enough the joy I felt when I ate this. It is only one slice, so I ordered a chocolate croissant to go with it.\n\nSourdough Waffles- came with strawberries, maple syrup, and vanilla bean butter. The waffles were incredibly fluffy with a hint of cinnamon or other spices that gave it a nice fragrant flavor. There was a pretty good portion of it too. This was my second choice if I hadn't gotten the quiche and it would have also definitely satisfied me.\n\nBouchon French Toast- I don't like French toast or bread pudding, which is what this resembles. My friend said it was good though. It's an incredibly tiny portion though (thanks Yelp again for pictures)\n\nOverall, this was definitely worth the money and my best meal of the trip.",1.0,0.9959776997566224

The serving staff seemed quite taken aback that we dared venture in during  this period of down time (which I'm sure they deserve) between official dining hours. The issue here however, is the cold rudeness they displayed at my inquiry about the times of dining. I know I am an unpleasant and disturbing sight at the best of times, but they looked at me like I was asking for a comped meal for Bill Cosby. The only salvation was that the young lady mopping the floor flapped the strands of mop across my shoes, affording me a decent shine (admittedly, I did walk in her path). I am old and decrepit.

The overall feeling that we had walking away was that we weren't let down, but we also weren't going to be itching to go back.\n\nThe service was excellent. In fact, I think our server's attitude, personality, and helpfulness was the best part of the experience, by far.\n\nOur group of four ordered quite a few things off of their brunch menu in order to taste as much as we could. The apps we ordered were decent. The beignets were really good. The boston cream \""filling\"" that they put on the bottom of the plate and rested the beignets on was somewhat plain, but when paired with the beignets, became a nice, complementing texture. \n\nThe deviled eggs had ham in them, and while the saltiness reminded me of deviled eggs with olives in the mix or garnish, I thought the ham was too overwhelming. The saltiness was a little too much after the first couple of bites. I think the ham component was an Easter Sunday-only thing, so it might not always be an issue.\n\nI ordered the angel food french toast, and while I LOVE sweet stuff for breakfast, I was left underwhelmed by my meal. It looked great on arrival, but in the end, the flavors just came together as one unfulfilling flavor that left me saying to myself that \""it just wasn't worth the calories.\"" I liked the airiness of the angel food cake that they used for french toast, but I would've preferred more flavor as opposed to the textural experiment of the light cake, seedy fruits, whipped cream and the warm creamy cheesecake filling they used.\n\nWe also ordered the tempura bacon and home fries on the side. The home fries were excellent. They were cooked perfectly, not greasy, and the small bits of bacon included were a nice flavor addition. The tempura bacon was such an awesome idea, but, in the end, their fluffy tempura batter took over and the bacon flavor was too subtle.\n\nOverall, Six Penn left the same impression that it always had when I went in the past. It's a slightly overpriced restaurant with a unique menu consisting of truly interesting ideas that never quite hit the spot. Will I go back?

I'm glad the fruit was all fresh.\n\nOn the flip side, the gnocchi tasted it like it'd been sitting out for several hours, the blueberry blintzes were doughy and tasted uncooked, the fried shrimp was mostly just batter and the batter was very bland, the creme brulee/custard tart thing was even blander, and the rice krispie treat with dried fruit and icing was okay but extremely soggy and not crispy at all.\n\nThe waitress who was serving beverages was incredibly creepy. We asked for two coffees, and when she only brought us one (empty) coffee cup and a large container of hot coffee, we pointed out we wanted two. \n\nShe glared at us, reluctantly looked down at her pad, and went, \""Oh, you're right, you asked for two.\"" (You're not allowed to get snippy when you wrote down the order and screwed it up.) Then when she brought the second cup, she'd filled it with coffee and glared at us again when she put it down. And then every time she walked by us, she'd look at us funny.\n\nNo joke, my friend ended up pouring the coffee out into a bowl because she was afraid the waitress had spit in it or something.\n\nDefinitely not going to come back here unless it's free.",0.0,0.997116208076477

The seats were too low to really be easy to slip into and out of, and on one side of the table there were no backs to the seats.  How comfortable can that be?

I ordered the basic American Breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast).  The only thing I finished was the bacon.  The eggs, while light and fluffy, were bland.  There was neither salt nor pepper on our table, and we weren't offered hot sauce.  The toast was dry.  While the bread was good, could I possibly have some butter, please?

My fella got the eggs benedict ($12) and loved that the poached eggs weren't runny.   It also came with prosciutto instead of canadian bacon, which was a neat twist, but they were a little stingy on the meat.  I also need to give the coffee a special award; it was rich and delicious.

Kitchen staff looked like they just woke up and threw on something off the floor from the bar the night before.....really unsightly.\nTHE FOOD: Looked nice taste was really at best mediocre. I do not get it....it could be a gem but unfortunately it is a dud. Can someone please tell me why this is classified as French ? Is it the name of the place just so happens to be two French words? Nothing about the place is French other than the name. Known for their Benedicts...then they should be better. Known for the Quiche.....then it should be better. A must try Beignets.....Have any of you ever been to Cafe Du Monde ?\nBrunch ? Ummm no that was not brunch by ANY definition. Really bland odd corned beef hash.........I love CBH and this was bad.....really bad.\nClientele: The clientele base really should know better. I think they do but for some reason they are there anyway.",0.0,0.9994856119155884

He was very attentive and full of suggestions after we told him it was our first visit. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded delish but I went with their Omelet...for one main reason: you can ADD as MANY toppings as you like!!!! \n\nWhoa. \n\nYou can chose options on and off the menu to pile on your three egg yummy creation so I went crazy....I chose bacon, ham, spinach, jalapenos and feta.\n\nFolks, that thing was delicious! It was prepared as I ordered, came out steaming HOT and add those hash browns and a biscuit ( yep. they are delish too) and plan to leave stuffed and happy. \n\nTotally recommend this place! I can't wait to go back!",1.0,0.9973741769790648

Honestly, I could keep going on, that is just a few of my favorite items!

Another had the scones with an egg and bacon. The scones were light and just right--not dry like some scones can be. And the devonshire sauce was incredible.

Of note, there isn't a HUGE variety compared to your run of the mill Vegas buffets but the quality is much higher.\n\nAbsolutely everything I put in my mouth was delicious. What really stood out were the entrees - steak with a homemade mustard for hubby, scallops with artichokes and other veggies for me. The chef is really great with subtle twists and spices added to the food. Fine dining within a buffet - awesome!\n\nThey had a large variety of fruit, traditional to more exotic starfruit and fresh lychees. The other desserts were presented as gorgeous little bites, so it's easy to try multiples without wasting. All were good.

Choices included ginger soy noodles, shellfish, charcuterie selections, veggies, BBQ pork buns, shaomai, and best of all the sashimi.

We were instructed to go upstairs to use a bathroom. After reviewing the brunch menu, I noticed it was a quite heavy on egg/savory dishes. In fact, there was only one sweet brunch option, a pistachio waffle with a cherry sauce and whipped cream. I ordered an OJ and the waffle. We then had plenty of time to catch up as our order took over half an hour. In total, we were there for over a hour and a half. Translation: service was very slow. As for the waffle, I enjoyed the slight pistachio flavor and the cherry sauce was great but, it was not heavy enough to sit on top of the waffle. It was easy absorbed into the waffle leaving a mushy center. All in all, I was not impressed with the food or service. I also would like to see more sweet brunch options.",0.0,0.9944077730178832

At one point, the hostess held the door open for a good amount of time, for a group of people descending down the stairs. Like, is that chivalry really necessary? And if it is, can't you just open the door for them when they get to it, instead of holding it open while they are 20 feet away as the other diners get frozen to their bones?

I got the pulled pork hash with scrambled eggs and I couldn't even eat all of it because they give you so much food and my mimosa never sat empty in it's glass for more than a minute. The servers are very quick and efficient and make sure you always have what you need. All my friends also loved their food and service and have made RnR part of their Sunday ritual. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports throughout the entire establishment. \n\nMy recommendations for RnR are to go earlier in the day because the later you go the longer you are going to wait, because it really is a very popular spot in Scottsdale (the wait can get up to an hour or longer). Definitely get the endless Bloody Mary/mimosa deal and if you are waiting for a table you can order the deal at the bar, pay $25 and then they take $10 off your total food bill. Their breakfast entrees are very delicious and they give you a lot of food, so if you get the endless bm/mimosa deal you can expect to spend $25-35, which isn't bad for a Sunday brunch. \n\nOverall loved my experience at RnR!",1.0,0.9978454113006592

There were both red and green grapes, a small piece of orange, a small piece of grapefruit, and half of a small strawberry. Sure, it was a small fruit cup, but everything in it was ripe and sweet. Definitely a great start to the meal! When my entree came out, it was pretty much a biscuit cut in two, with a few slices of bacon, and topped off with some cheese.  Also on the plate was about half a potato's worth of house potatoes.  I honestly could not taste any jalapeno in the bacon, but the entire meal itself was delicious!  However, for the price of $13, I would have expected a bit more food for this particular entree.\n\nI'd be back again, because the atmosphere and food was great! It was just the price that got to me.

Even though they were pretty crowded they cordially let us sit down and didn't make us wait until our whole party was there. About a minute after being seated we were greeted by one of the most cheerful waiters I have ever encountered--I forget his name but he has red hair--and offered us some drinks to start with while we wait for our friends.

My first bite was so good, I did not want to put my fork down, but I did ( at least a few times to say how good my food really was).

And sadly for my taste, it was a very big let down. While walking inside and enjoying their decor was very eye popping and intriguing, their food was \""meh.\""\n\nThey serve about 12 dishes (7 hot dishes) and they also have chocolate waffles and french toast. The waffles, toast, and eggs with bacon have to be ordered so the waiter brings them out. (No worries, they're part of the buffet)\n\nSo why 2 stars? Here are the problems I felt uncomfortable with...\n\n1. $18 a pop?! I mean come on the variety of food isn't that extensive at the same time I felt as if none of the dishes popped out to me as absolutely amazing. I believe that 18 for brunch I paid for was presentation of food...\n\n2. The service - it was okay, I mean I did expect a little more. The cups I drank water out of was lets say, a little smelly? The waiters use rags to wipe the glass cups down, and well I think that's what makes glasses smelly.\n\n3. The food - as mentioned before, the food was okay. But the price of the brunch and the materials of the food didn't make sense. Think about it, Swedish meatballs one of their raved about dishes... Everyone compares it to Ikea, yes it's better but the price of it doesn't make sense. Probably the most expensive plate is the \""smoked\"" salmon. To me, I didn't feel like that salmon was really smoked at the same time there was no taste in it (maybe because I didn't add the extra flavors to the salmon?)\n\nHowever, even these reasons are some of the reasons why this restaurant turn me off off..others can see why this restaurant is good. One thing I did notice is that all their food is really healthy. Their dishes didn't have that much oil, their most unhealthy dish is probably the brisket because of the fat. That, to me could probably make their prices a little more, but still I don't still quite believe it would be that much.\n\nAnyways, for me I rather go eat a vietnamese brunch on a Sunday spending a lot less for more variety and at the same time the healthy option is there for me to choose.

I was a ittle disappointed to see that the strawberries were not actually chocolate covered but werenormal strawberries with chocolate sauce drizzled over the french toast. A little bit of false advertising if you as me but I was still excited to take my first bite. My excitement soon diminished. The french toast was hard. I'm not talking been left on the griddle too long hard. I'm talking stale bread that has been left out for a couple days hard. It was so hard, I had difficulty cutting into it with my knife.

It seems they keep their breakfast menu small and use fresh ingredients. The prices were also very good. However, it took a long time to get our food and when it arrived it was poorly put together. I ordered the crab cakes benedict. Apparently the reason why it took so long was because they were out of the Hollandaise sauce and they wanted to make some fresh for my order. Well they really didn't make much sauce then because there was barely any on the eggs benedict. It was also missing the english muffins because the server stated the cook was going to serve me burnt english muffins originally and the server sent it back. My fiance ordered the breakfast burrito and I will tell you it looked awful. There was only was piece of sausage and the cheese was not melted.

Very dark, with lots of wood.  It was cozy, but the chairs were not the most comfortable, especially the ones with arms.  If you are anything bigger than a size 12 or 14, you might want to opt for one of the armless chairs for a more comfortable dining experience.\n\nService:  Very nice and prompt.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about.\n\nFood.  YUMMY!!!!!   But WAY overpriced.  We started with mocha lattes, which was one of the best I'd ever had - rich and creamy and just total perfection.  But a very small portion for the $8 pricetag.  \n  \nThen we shared the Well Mannered Omelet ($14 I think)- and it too was delicious perfection.  There was so much goat cheese oozing from the omelet, and the side of potatoes were spiced just right.  It also came with a sugar dusted biscuit and chocolate dipping sauce...mmmmm.  So good.\n\nWe also shared the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Pancakes, and ate every fabulous bite. However, $15 for pancakes is just too much to spend, even being as delicious as they were.\n\nMy friend got the Max Brenner burger. (about $15 I think) She had ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well, but they quickly fixed it for her.  I didn't try the burger, but I did have several of her chocolate dusted waffle fries.  YUM YUM!  Who'd have thought....fries and chocolate?\n\nOverall, I would have rated it higher except that it was just too overpriced.  I guess I should have anticipated that given there were no prices on the restaurant website. And I suppose it is par for the course for a restaurant on the Strip.

Because it was a sunday, they had $10 bottles of champagne (we had mimosas) and 2 for 1 drinks (anything!). Along with that, they served brunch ALL DAY! \nOur server was Jim and he was fabulous! He was definitely busy but that never stopped him from making a quick stop by the table making sure we were doing ok. He recommended some great acai/blueberry shots and made great recommendations for what we should order. Jim was great.\nWe started with the lettuce wraps with chicken and the bread with some kind of cheese sauce. Both were great and I was tempted to make the lettuce wraps my lunch! I ordered a cheeseburger which was massive and delicious but I could not finish it. My boyfriend got the meaty omlette, definitely meaty but could have used a bit more cheese.

I do not plan to return for dinner, ever, if anything maybe for brunch if it's suggested. Definitely over rated, over priced for what they offer. It was $35 for dinner and supposed to be gourmet but I couldn't find any item that can be considered gourmet. Almost no seafood (They had mediocre, lack of flavor salmon, cod, crab legs) and their overall selection was not good at all. I couldn't find any single dinner item that I liked. I'd rather spend $35 at somewhere else that eating mediocre food. However, I had at least hopes up for dessert as they left good impression when I went for brunch months ago... and it failed too. Their dessert was not as good as before, lack of flavor, everything was just so sugarly sweet. \n\nAs mentioned not sure if I'd return here.

The desserts were great, and they have a nice gelato selection-- I was amused by the Thai Tea gelato; the best was probably the Almond Joy. The juices were good as well.\nBf loved the fried chicken, beet salad, white chocolate mouse topped with gold flakes.\n\nCompared to Bacchanal, the variety/quality/creativity were all  less in my opinion. There is a good variety of meat, and I loved that they had bone marrow (remember to add the chimichurri!), but there is very little seafood except for smoked salmon and a few types of sushi that were pretty bland. If you're into seafood, this is not the place, at least not for their brunch/lunch. Bacchanal also does better with their thematic cuisines, for example while Bacchanal has an impressive array of dim sum, stir fried vegetable./rice/ noodle dishes, noodle soups, sushi for their asian cuisine, Wicked spoon had 3 somewhat cheesily boxed dishes of rice and noodles and 4 types of sushi.

They offered things such as a delicious risotto, or a creamy tomato gnocchi, and they were each served at the buffet in these adorable mini saucepans. All of the different egg dishes at the buffet were phenomenal. My significant other said that the French toast was the best he had ever eaten, and from its appearance, I found that easy to believe.

The bacon was crisp and delicious, not rubbery like the MGM buffet and the eggs were light, fluffy and not overly salted or buttered.

While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio.

Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit?

The pancakes were very filling and a good portion size; I could only finish half of them because I got full halfway through my meal.\n\nIn general, despite getting the cold shoulder initially, it was an enjoyable meal.

I have been to Point Bruges several times and know that if you want to go to brunch and don't want to wait in line you get there early.  We arrived at 10:30 for an 11 am open.  We were not the only ones.  Standing about 4th in line, we were sat within minutes of opening and had waters and some of the best coffee I have ever had within a few minutes more.  \n\nA and I like to think that we are brunch professionals having sampled quite a few in the city, so we knew that we should try something varied in order to share.  She ordered the omelette of the day which was prosciutto, asparagus and goat cheese with fresh fruit.  The salty meat and savory vegetables melded perfectly with the creamy goat cheese.  The eggs were cooked to perfection with just enough crisp on the edges.  Slices of cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon surrounded a pile of strawberries and grapes.  All of the fruit was perfectly ripe.  \n\nI ordered the brunch-style Poutine.  When eating out, go big or go home.  The massive pile of double-fried fries was covered with 2 fried eggs - again perfectly cooked.  These people know their eggs.  Scattered throughout the pile were local cheese curds.  Having a lot of friends from Wisconsin, I like to think that I know my cheese curds.  They need to squeak if they are good - and these squeaked away.  A surprising treat was the homemade maple-apple sausage.  Real apples, definitely real maple syrup and delicious pork made up the sausage.  The fries were definitely more than I could handle, but A was happy to help.  For me, brunch would not be complete with a Bloody Mary and this was a serious Bloody Mary - no pre-made, store-bought mix here.

Situated on Bryant Street in Highland Park, they were right around the corner from where I stayed the first time I visited Pittsburgh. I feel pretty lucky to have this place be one of the first restaurants I've tried because it is so darned good. \n\nThis is a Saturday and Sunday brunch place which is super important to me, the idea that you can only brunch on Sunday is something that Pittsburgh has GOT TO STOP. It's the weekend? you should be able to brunch. End of story.\n\nTheir brunch menu is pretty big with lots of options if you're indecisive. They even have a prix fix option where you get a brunch beverages, brunch meal, and a side dish.

I was also disappointed with the amount of pork in the omelette, which seemed rather stingy.  While I liked the flakiness of the potatoes (they were more akin to a casserole), I also found them bland, flavor-wise.

My friend and I went this Saturday and arrived around 2 pm, and were seated quite quickly.\n\nI ordered a bloody mary, and then we had the french toast with apples / pears / cranberries, and the trout and scrambled eggs on toast. The bloody mary was pretty darn good, but I wished it to be spicier! Personally, I really enjoyed the french toast - I've rarely had fresh cranberries on anything, and that added a nice touch to the overall dish, as simple as it is. The trout was fresh, though small in portions, but my friend was addicted to the scrambled eggs as they were sort of more liquid, like a scrambled egg sauce. We weren't huge fans of the toast that accompanied the eggs, though, as it was quite hard and we weren't a fan of the flavour.\n\nService was good - water was frequently refilled and staff were friendly.  The decor is quite like the post-modern industrial feel with industrial wire lightbulbs, and darker blue colours with cool art hanging about. I also really dug the wallpaper in the washroom, as a side note.\n\nGlad I got to try Lawrence this time around!",1.0,0.99293452501297

We decided to have brunch and celebrate Easter after a few days of fasting and abstinence. After getting vetoed by the wifey on the choice of brunch location, we ended up at Butters Pancake & Cafe. \n\nI don't know if it's just because of Easter brunch or if this is a usual Sunday wait but we waited for our seat for 40 mins. Could be a good sign that the food is that good or a bad sign that the service is really slow (after finishing the meal, I found out that it was the good food that made the line.

The patio was right beside a fountain that made you feel like enjoying a scene from a french movie. \n\nThe food... I ordered California Scrambler with a side of fresh fruit and protein power pancakes. My wife got a Veggie omelette with a side of french toast. The California scrambler was very original for my taste (maybe its because I never lived in California) because of the avocado mixed together with the scrambled eggs. It worked for me. Just enough yum for my taste. The protein pancake was really good. Maybe its my love for cinnamon but I think it is also the texture added by the nuts and oats that made me want to finish my plate.\n\nMy wife had a veggie omelette. It was a little bland for my taste. I would have liked a little more salt and pepper but my wife loved it. Maybe it was the swiss cheese that made her finish her plate. \n\nOverall, the place is nice. The food is a little above the usual. Anything special? My brunch, not so much.

So when a good friend came to visit and needed some afternoon snackage, I was keen to try it out.\n\nShe ordered haddock goujons and chips, whilst I just had a tea. It made my day that the tea came with a small square of tiffin type traybake. Such a nice touch. The haddock goujons were presented quite elaborately in a small metal pot, spilling over the top. Very fresh, light batter. The chips were a bit forgettable but the haddock was lovely (yes I did try).\n\nThe interior is fresh, modern, quite simple but also with style. Open brick work, greens and browns, and the absolutely stunning view from the top of the mound. My only concern is that this place will become very popular very soon.\n\nBut they do have an exciting looking Brunch menu that I will be back to try on a Sunday.

Having 7 years of restaurant experience I was dumbfounded that it took this long. I'm honestly still in shock. When our server finally made his way over to our table, I ordered the special pancakes- cornmeal with lemon and blueberry. Our food also took quite a long time so our waiter provided us with monkey bread to share as an appetizer on the house. The monkey bread aka glorified cinnamon roll was a sugar explosion in my mouth. Yummm. I liked it so much I took one to go with the intention of giving it to my husband but ate half of it myself later on. As far as my pancakes were concerned, I wasn't as impressed. They tasted like cornbread with blueberries. I wasn't able to find the lemon at all. Another disappointment, the syrup. I was given standard maple syrup. The dish could have easily become 4 stars with a warm blueberry sauce or lemon creme anglaise. I also ordered a side of the peppered bacon with my pancakes. The bacon was delicious and savory. It added another dimension of flavor to an otherwise bland meal. All in all, I would not return to MNP for brunch.

It had a wonderful flavor and it and was cooked as to be not to crunchy or limp. I had a slice of ham that was so succulent and tender. I also tried three different types of potatoes. I had some mashed, au gratin, and hash browns. Each was done quite nicely and had a good flavor to them. Most of the time when I have fruit at the Feast Buffet it is not flavorful at all.

The cobbler had a nice texture and flavor to it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I did enjoy it.\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly. We arrived before the big rush and did not have to wait to long. Our server got to us soon after sitting down. She got our refills on our drinks in a very timely manner.

The staff is young, mostly students, and although they do their best, often their attitude is that of indifference.\n\nFood: Large menu, with the typical items found at other brunch places.

Terrace Cafe has a lot of unique dishes - like a Red Velvet Waffle and S'mores French Toast. I ended up with a special - Bananas Foster Waffle. Woah! Almost more like a dessert than a meal - it was so good. Waffle was baked perfectly. The bananas foster was sweet, with enough sauce that I didn't need syrup. It also came with eggs - I chose scrambled. Not too runny, not too dry. I was most impressed by the fruit. It was not your typical lame brunch - with some sad-looking melons. Oh no, not at Terrace Cafe. I got a few pieces of melon, but mostly strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, kiwi and mango. Mango! If fruit is an option for a side, I highly recommend it.\n\nA few other nice touches - my hot tea came in an individual pot of hot water. Our waitress brought a box full of teas from which to choose. The dishware is very chic: curved water glasses, rectangular white plates, interestingly curved silverware.\n\nMy one complaint was our waitress. She seemed a bit detached and wasn't very attentive to our table, though we noticed she paid more attention to others around us. She did not check on us after our meal arrived.

The dog though was awesome.  It's just a hot dog with tomato, cucumber and this delicious spicy mayo.  I'm glad I ordered both meals though it wasn't finished but they packed it up for us to go.  I had some of the fried chicken and waffles as I was swapping food with my brunch partner and that was also good!  I don't think you can go wrong here, though I heard the Coke burger was OK but I didn't get a chance to try it myself.\n\nThe diner doesn't look like it holds 20 people so you'll more than likely have to wait when you arrive but check it out, it's pretty damn delicious and a bit different than a lot of places you might be able to grab brunch downtown.  There are no tables here and you'll be seated at a bench or long one sided table.

My fiance ordered a grilled chicken burrito smothered with red sauce and a vampiro taco which consisted of carne asada and chipolte sauce. I absolutely loved my papas (see picture)!! They were cooked perfectly with bacon and chorizo and the chipolte crema is delicious. It is enough food to feed about 4 people so be aware of that. I have leftovers for days which I don't mind. My fiance's chicken burrito was also delicious. The red sauce was very tomato based and tasted great, clearly house made. \n\nThere are many other menu items I would love to try here and I will definitely be returning to try more. They do have a taco with the ghost chili which I will give a try in the future.

The omelet station is on point, plus they offer egg whites. :) The bread pudding was a hit on the first round, but the next batch seemed rushed/too soggy. Not a lot of variety, but it is tasty and you leave satisfied. We plan to return and try their other menu items as the regular menu is available at 5p on Sundays.",1.0,0.9932231903076172

I had a couple pieces of flatbread, some eggs, grits, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, and the piece de resistance, merengue waffles.  What was on the buffet that I didn't try: warm brie, two other types of flatbread, sausage, bacon, penne & sausage, rum-soaked pineapple, veggie quiche, hummus, orange-oreo cheesecake, muffins, and bread pudding.\n\nAs I mentioned, the eggs were the only disappointing item on the buffet.  Everything else I had was top-notch.  OJ and what appeared to apple juice are included in the cost of the buffet.\n\nLater in the morning, the line for the buffet wrapped around the room to the omelet station.

Because if there's one thing I'd hold against them, it'd be their service. The waitress was nice enough. Although before our knowledgable friend arrived we were quite confused on how things worked. The service told us to just go down stairs after she took our drink order. Before we were able to inquire about what that meant she was gone. We found out from our friend that it was a brunch buffet. Everything made sense! Upon hearing this though we were all rather skeptical. My doubts started to wain once I saw the selection that was before me. They had everything from potatoes, to mussels, to eggs Benedict, bacon, to waffles, pizza, tarts, & even a cook to order omelette station! At $15 it's actually quite a steal if you plate wisely.

They were moist and doughy, not the light fluffy texture I associate with beignets. There was a box of Cafe du Monde beignet mix sitting on a shelf in the kitchen so I guess maybe they use that? But the texture was unlike the real thing and not even like the ones I've made with the same mix at home. They were served with a really tasty jam that greatly improved the flavor, though.\n\nI also found the coffee to be a bit weak, which is normally not something I would not even bother to mention, but I think it's important for a breakfast/brunch spot to have great coffee.\n\nMy husband had a chicken-fried steak which I did not sample.

It was such a fun environment to be in and you could see the owner going around to tables and meeting with customers.\n \nOur eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs so these three dishes were way too much for us, but Yay for yummy left overs later!  Here is what we ordered:\n\nChilaquiles scrambled eggs - The sausage on this dish was savory and sweet and amazing.  The sausage was my favorite part of the dish.  The meat was halved and rested on a bead of eggs, cheese, salsa, and chips.  The salsa wasn't my favorite because it was a bit to smokey in flavoring for my taste.  Overall it wasn't a bad dish, but I'll likely explore other things on the menu before in re-order this dish.\n\nTruffled egg sandwich - I can totally see why this dish is so popular on Yelp.  It was amazing!  The eggs, the bacon (and I'm not even a bacon person, the ciabatta bread, and the potatoes.  I highly recommend this for first times to eat.  It will definitely be a great introduction to the food at eat.\n\nShort Stack - The best pancakes I have ever had.  They were super thick and fluffy and mind blowing.  A short stack comes with two 1/2 inch pancakes, topped with lots of powdered sugar, with jarred maple syrup on the side.

And when we asked for the bill due to being irritated, (it takes a lot to upset me as I am patient) Park still wanted to charge us $20 for one mimosa (which is a tiny cup) and one other round that was still at the bar that we were waiting for. Rest assured, we'll be speaking to a manager after this review because quite frankly, I was expecting more from this establishment. I would understand if the waitress took upon it to let us know if they were backed up or to even apologize, but she would pass by us (and the other table that left) until we called her over. I don't expect full on attention, but at least some consideration would have been appreciated.",0.0,0.9992635846138

We mixed them together. Incredible. \n\nSous Vide Eggs - sweet potato hash compliments the duck pastrami and egg that's cooked to a nice creamy perfection. All of this is drizzled with a yuzu hollandaise.. Making a very eclectic spin on the traditional brunch eggs Benedict. \n\nThere is a sushi cart offered with a widespread variety of rolls, sashimi and nigiris. We nibbled lightly on this .. Wanting to fill up on the brunchy goodness. \n\nYou're then offered a salad for the table... And we each got to select an entree. I chose the spicy filet... Always a favorite. My guests chose the jiodori chicken and the salmon teriyaki. We also devoured their wild mushroom kamamashi pot. Great warm ending to the meal. Especially for a rainy brunch Sunday. \n\nI definitely recommend pairing your brunch with bubbles. We paired our waffles and eggs with the Mo\u00ebt Rose, but they offer a great list of bubbles and cocktails to start your Sunday off right. \n\nOverall, Baku impresses again.

A friend and I went on a game day around 11 am. I expected to have to wait, but was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately at the u-shaped bar in the back. Honestly, I think this was a great place to sit on our first visit. It gave us a chance to watch the kitchen, expediters, and other staff, who seemed to congregate back there and see order as they came up. I'm happy to say that this view didn't ruin the experience.

Really tasty and hearty, but nothing we couldn't do at home. The potatoes were really good though-- not overly fried or seasoned. 2) Chicken and a Biscuit. A huuuge piece of crispy fried white meat balanced on a flavorful biscuit. Topped with an egg (I asked for mine scrambled, which they were happy to do) with a flavorful sausage gravy and greens on the side. I'm not sure how one could make sausage gravy look appealing, and I've got to be honest, the look turned me off for a minute. Without being too frank, the peach-orange color and chunks of sausage an corn looked a little bit... uh... gross. That being said, once you get past that, it's really delicious! I swear! The greens on the side were a nice way to balance the heavy dish. 3) Chocolate Pancakes. To. Die. For. But they might as well remove the \""pan\"" part. Between the chocolate in the batter and the chocolate buttercream on top, it's really a dessert. \n\nIn all, it wasn't the healthiest breakfast, but we were there to go big, and we did.

I didn't really taste the fakin' bacon or the garlic supposedly in the dish.  I'm not surprised though,  since a lot of vegetarian places seem to go light on the seasoning.  Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.\n\nNo complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  \n\nThe cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.

I started with the morning glory cocktail, bubbly, pineapple juice and cointreau.  It is a generous size, so I had to switch to a mimosa for my second one (good thing I was not driving).  I had the Menage with monkey cakes, wow the best pancake I have ever had.  The banana and coconut combination was so delicious,  I requested it without almonds (I don't have any allergies, I just didn't feel like having almonds).

All served with quality sides and attentive service. (Peet's coffee is so tasty too!) What a value! A great place to take visitors or just yourself.

Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food.",1.0,0.9996153116226196

The servings were small - by any Montreal breakfast standards, let alone the prices they charged. I had the breakfast muffin which was tasty, but basically just a $15 Sausage-McMuffin.\n\nThe coffee was expensive, tasted terrible, and was served in small cups. My sometimes-alcoholic friend (birds of a feather...) ordered a cocktail, which even he struggled to finish.\n\nThe decore is OK, but hardly original. It looks just like Liverpool House and Joe Beef (which I can understand look the same, as they're run/owned by the same person and right next door to each other), to the point where there's even a picture of Joe Beef on the wall.\n\nI have heard (both on Yelp and offline) that the brunch for two is good.

It has chicken, sour cream, cheese, and topped with eggs any style. This was quite yummy but it was spicy! Omg, I'm a wuss so I was dying. Someone should've warned me because it didn't say it on the menu. I think it would've been better if it wasn't so dam spicy for me. My friend ordered the Wolfpack. This comes with hashbrowns, cheese, bacon, and eggs. We topped it with gravy which made it delicious. \n\nWe washed everything down with Mimosas. I like the mimosas here. For $5 you get a pretty good size glass, not one of those skinny champagne glasses that it comes in. I'll definitely come back to try some more items on there! =)",1.0,0.9657395482063292
