The location is lovely, the view wonderful and the staff very friendly.  A bit slow on the service, but very friendly: my glass of water always full, bread constantly and my wine refilled without asking.  The ambience is very nice and would work great for a romantic dinner, but also for a group meeting.  The food was ok.  The menu had a lot of variety and  the description of each meal promised a succulent experience but when I tasted it the blend of the flavors was quite not there.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was well cooked, the fish was nice...it is just that I could not detect well the interesting combination of flavors that I saw described.  The portions were nice and you certainly feel satisfied when you are done with your courses.  I love a quiet restaurant where you can enjoy conversation while you eat: definitively I was able to do that in addition of enjoying a wonderful view.  My only other complaint is the parking...this restaurant is part of the Marriott resort and valet is the only option.  On Friday night they only had one person to take care of the valet for the hotel and the restaurant (which was surprising) so, of course, I had to wait a good 10 minutes to get my car taken when I arrived and another 5-10 when I left.  Finally, the restaurant has a nice bar downstairs from which you also can enjoy the view.  It has a pool table so it looks like a great place to hang out with friends.",1.0,0.9987747073173524

I didn't observe any of the negative things some of the other people might have reported in other reviews of Grape Street.  My 2 other friends both enjoyed their meals and complimented the quality.  All 3 of us ordered a glass of wine too and it was great!  The design is brick walls with industrial style ceilings and has a nice vibe to it.  I have a bit of hearing loss and I did find the acoustics of the location to be difficult for me to hear well in there.

Half off wine and appetizers. The Sauvignon Blanc was wonderful and the appetizers even better. My friend and I shared the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned. She ordered the grilled cheese (I believe it was called the Mary Anne Grilled Cheese) with the soup of the day (tomato bisque) and both were delicious.

It's a small restaurant on E. Carson St.  You enter off the sidewalk and walk into a small arrival area with a very small bar to the right.  The bar really isn't that functional and I'm guessing not used too much.  The dining room is bright with relaxing colors and a bookshelf on one side of the room and large windows with a view of the street on the other.  It has a \""homey\"" feel to it.  The tables are reasonable spread apart with fresh flowers on each table.  We were sat at a good table with a nice view of E. Carson.  The service is better than average.  We had a friendly waitress who was pretty error free except for forgetting my friends glass of wine.  The meal started with some nice crusty french bread with room temp. butter.  Then I had the pate', which was not what I expected being pork instead of liver.  Nevertheless, it was very tasty.  My friend had a good looking salad.  My entree' was the chicken.  This was delicious and it was how chicken should be served in a restaurant.  It wasn't just the breast, but some of the tastier cuts served in a nice broth with root vegatables.  It was delicious and total comfort food.  My friend had the trout, which looked very good.  We both had the sorbet, which was delicious.  I especially liked the coconut flavor.  This was a great meal for a very reasonable $35 each prix fix.  The wine selection was pretty good.  I'll definitely go again.",1.0,0.999334156513214

I was rather surprised to find that the inside is actually rather nice for what you would expect in a strip mall.

Also, four others arrived for their take out within 10 minutes! \nNow for the food, I ordered the penne vodka with chicken while hubs ordered a chicken sandwich. My penne vodka was creamy and delicious. If you like a creamy vodka sauce, Armstrong's is for you. I prefer a slightly more tangy vodka sauce but I enjoyed this sauce none the less. Did I mention the portion size? I had pasta for three days! The pasta also came with a salad. Nice size salad as well with field greens, tomato, olive and chic peas. Unfortunately, the vinagerette dressing was rather bland and tasteless. Thus the reason for 4 stars rather than five.

I've ordered that at a few other places and Cathouse, by far, had the best. The mushroom ravioli was a bit hard but it still tasted good. The dessert menu here is to die for. I have only eaten at an average percentage of Las Vegas restaurants but I'm pretty sure this is the only place where you'll be able to order red velvet cake and peppermint cotton candy.\n\nThe burlesque atmosphere manifests itself in almost every detail of the restaurant. The red patent leather doors, the black and white pictures on the walls, the waitresses' outfits, the interior of the restaurant, and best of all, the window. As someone who has no interest in nudity but loves to watch sexy girls dance, I really liked that every half hour or so, a very attractive girl would appear behind appear in a small room behind a large glass window. She would change behind a blanket, apply makeup to herself, read, etc.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced and tastes delicious.

At 6:00 there was a 45 minute wait and the area around the bar was PACKED. Like, can't move. It looked like a country club convention threw up all over it. WINE WINE WINE, and middle-agers chugging it! It was kind of comical, but we didn't really feel like waiting in standing-room only for that long.\n\nSo I made a reservation last week and tried again. We were sat in the very back by the kitchen, but whatevs. Maybe they want women clad in rhinestone-adorned back jean pockets to walk in and see only familiar faces. \n\nService took a while, but I think it's because our gal was overwhelmed. I saw her party of 7 beckon her over to take their orders once she came by for our drink orders. And it took a while to get from the bar for drinks back to our table, roughly half a mile away.\n\nThe good though, was the food. The pizza was spectacular! I'm not sure how they made it so crispy/charred underneath and fluffy inside?! It boasted an garlicky olive oil base, covered in housemade fresh mozz, tomato, spinach and a sprinkling of ricotta, which I'll sub out for feta if I get it next time. Just needed a little flavor contrast.  Boyfran had the meatball panini, which he dubbed one of the best of all time. The salads we started with were amazeballs.

Between the two of us, we tried 75% of the menu and there was nothing that didn't just break my heart with its perfection of flavor. However, the champagne used in the Bellini I ordered was really sharp and brutal, tasting like fruity rubbing alcohol rather than champagne brimming with mellow peach.\n\nThe room we dined in had serious mood lighting going on, leaving us to hold hands during dinner so as not to lose one another in the dark. Not a bad thing, all the more romantic, right? Besides, once Barrymore staff drew back the grey diaphanous curtains, there was a spectacular view of the Riviera's rainbow of neon.\n\nThe only question in my mind was why the Barrymore made it so hard to get a table when the restaurant was half empty? We called for a reservation in the evening, and they turned us away. 15 minutes later I noticed a \""book a table here\"" icon on Yelp and it said they had a table for multiple times available, so I used that to get a table.

Half the party got there early and sat in the bar area for a drink. The tag line is; Beef, booze, and broads. They do have all three. The beef was decent. I had the steak tartare and the New York strip. The tartare is the better of the two. The chopped salad with the peppercorn dressing was better than the caesar as well. That tend to be the trend with most of the items on their menu. If we ordered two items, one was the crowd favorite. I do have to make a special note about the jumbo lump crab cakes. They are spectacular. The separation in meat was impressive. It was predominantly crab. If you want to try more than one side, the option of pick any three for $15 is a small savings. The portions are big, so it is easy to share. We got the jumbo baked potato, corn brulee, and sweet potato wedges. The sweet potato was the favorite. It came with a honey jalapeno dipping sauce. I would definitely order it again if I went back.\n\nAs for booze, their bartenders are good. I have had better Manhattans, but it was nothing to frown upon. My friend tried a cable car for the first time and enjoyed it. Their specialty drinks all tailor towards the sweet cocktail drinkers.\n\nThe broads are present as well.
