CHEESE! The store was a little on the \""sloppy/pack rat/ sweaty/ definitely wouldn't hurt to mop every once in a while\"" side. My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \""Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\"" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Oh and the fact that it wasn't that clean.",0.0,0.9187645316123962

The service was fine.\n\nFIRST COURSE: Lox with cream spread and bread and Oysters\nThe salmon tasted like it was two weeks old. It had that rancid fish smell you get when you buy old discount fish from meijer. The oysters were the same. Terrible.\n\nSECOND COURSE: Coconut Shrimp and Mixed greens with beets\nThe Coconut Shrimp tasted like it came straight from the buffet line at a cheap Chinese restaurant. Cheap quality. I wouldn't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco. Mixed greens with beets was pretty good. \n\nTHIRD COURSE: New York Strip Steak and Lamp Chops\nI swear on my life this is the worst steak I've ever had. The meat was tough and stringy. It was WAY over-seasoned. And it was like 50% tough, inedible fat. I could make a better steak when I was 12. The Lamb Chops were so tough, we couldn't even eat them. \n\nDESSERT: Berry pastry, flourless chocolate cake, and some shitty marshmallow thing covered in chocolate and coconut\nWhat can I say? Dessert was the best part of the meal. And it was still awful. The pastry was fine. Nice and flaky. However, the flourless chocolate cake (portion was the size of my thumb) was subpar, and the marshmallow dessert tasted like sugared tar. It was impossible to chew.\n\nDropped $120 with tip (two people) for the worst food I've ever had at a respectable looking restaurant. I understand it was a set menu day and their tapas are better.

That's just the way of it.\n\nThe food seems ample, but it really doesn't satisfy. Shove a plate full of the oddly-textured waffles slathered in butter substitute into your mouth and you'll be hungry for lunch two hours later. It's not cheap, either.\n\nSo why does it exist?

We were all shocked when she then went about her business, serving said sneezed-upon meals, without batting an eye.  I was utterly speechless.  My plate was the only non-sneezed-upon meal, so I offered to just split mine with my friends (there was certainly enough of it).\n\nJeez Louise.

Sad food make me a sad boy.\n\nI'm not usually too critical of the atmosphere either since I've been to dives that were dingy but had good food.  But this China Star over here on Charleston?

Scummy food in an even scummier area of Phoenix. I have to start with the fact the they WILL NOT refund your money once you pay for something. So in my case, I ordered a famous apple burger extra well done to go with a side of mac and cheese that they claim was baked (it was not). The mac and cheese was pasta shells covered in a creamy cheese flavored sauce, about as appetizing as squirt cheese out of a can. Ok we are back at the hotel room and the burger is woefully undercooked and I call and say I'm coming back and just want a refund, but not here. This is the only place in America where you are forced to get something else because of some dimwit policy of no refunds. So, they are saying if I find a cockroach in my initial order, I'm really going to want to order another item? Insane. Fine, I dash back before closing and order the chicken sandwich. This is a sorry piece of chicken breast on a soggy bun, just like the burger with condiments straight from the year they opened -1956. The french fries that arrived with the chicken were solid grease - not potatoes mind you - just basically heavy potato grease. The crazier thing is they included a free mac and cheese with 2nd  order and that looked nothing like the first order. WTF? This version looked exactly like kraft style with those thin pasta tubes, etc and I'm pretty sure it was (see photo). Will the real mac and cheese please stand up. Then the waitress tells me that she has never heard of any restaurant returning money in her life. What planet is she from and what is wrong with this dump?  Oh, the apple burger was a mess also, sloppily prepared, strange sliced apples on top of cheddar cheese and more lettuce than the big salad on Seinfeld. Two cops were hanging out here and I felt like telling them I got robbed because basically they took my money and wouldn't give it back despite the lousy experience. If I had started this process at 5pm, I swear I would have tried 10 different things and kept saying I don't like it and see if they would have returned my money then. Theives.

(See my review.) \n\nOn other notes... \n\n-- the place has that funky antiseptic old-folks' home smell. \n-- the lunch crowd (4 or 5 other tables of diners) looked like most lived a pretty hard life. \n-- the booths could definitely use a good cleaning. \n\nOkay, so I went there for lunch today with my son, Jacob. The chips and salsa were okay, not great; the salsa was fine-- but certainly not like La Fonda Del Sol's-- and the chips were nice and hot but wet with grease. Jacob ordered a chicken fajita burrito with green sauce, and I ordered a small chicken nachos. Jacob's burro was not too bad. The green sauce was flavorful and really spicy (which I like more than him), but Jacob commented that the chicken seemed \""a little gristly\"" and the bell peppers had a weird taste to them. \n\nMy nachos, however, were inedible! They came with the shredded chicken sprinkled on top of the rest of the toppings. The chicken was lukewarm and really funky tasting.  Jacob was a bit annoyed and I think he thought I was being difficult because of their presentation until I made him taste the chicken. He quickly agreed that it was gross (and preceded to use his soda to cleanse his pallet). \n\nAs I stated above, service was good, so the waitress was very nice, took away the offensive dish, and I ordered a machaca burrito with fundito sauce instead. The burro was okay, not great. Their machaca is minced very fine to almost a paste consistency (which I do not find very appealing --think dog food) and the fundito was okay but a bit bland. I wished that I had gone with the green sauce-- maybe even the chicken fajita filling as well.\n\nAll in all, a pretty unpleasant experience.

One had a high chair that a baby had been sitting in and it showed.  There was food all over the place. Tables and floors alike.  Another table still had old dried up rice all over it and a wiping rag just sitting there.  Tables don't wipe themselves.  To top it off there was a man working on the beverage fridge.  Thats fine right?  Wrong.  He was crawling up underneath it and using an acetylene torch.  I could smell it every time he sparked it on and I could hear loud pops every time he turned it off.  It was crazy.  This flame in such a small area was getting very close to the 2-liter bottles stored back there.  It was kind of scary.  I thought the place was going to blow up.  It seems inappropriate to be using a torch during dinner hours and so close to the dining room.  \n\nAs for the food, I ordered from the Japanese side for a change.  A chicken katsu bento box with white rice, a salad and fried shumai.  The shumai threw me.  I would expect gyoza in a bento box faster than I would shumai.  Don't get me wrong.  The shumai was fine.  Just not what I would expect.  The katsu was superbly crispy.  I with there was more of it.  And more of the sauce would have been nice too.  As for the salad.  The \""ice\"" in the iceberg lettuce must have melted because that salad of nothing but iceberg lettuce was floating in a pool of water.

Matt however, wasn't a fan of his pasta and had half of the big bowl left. He still wanted a second bowl of something different, and asked if I could take the rest of the pesto home as leftovers since he didn't like it. The waitress said due to policy they can't box up the first round of pasta. \n\nOkay, I would understand if Matt didn't completely finish his second bowl and kept asking for to-go boxes, but come on. I can't believe that they just wasted all of that food that I would have gladly ate for lunch the next day. They need to change the policy that you can only take home one portion or something. That policy just totally puts me off from coming back as soon as I usually do. \n\nOverall the experience was alright but wasting that food is upsetting.

We were all dressed appropriately and aren't slobs, obviously-- however, when we didn't bite on the waiter's offer for the several-hundred dollar special of the night, his demeanor flipped a 180 and we were legitimately treated less than an ugly sweater at a thrift shop.  \n\nAnd, to add extreme insult to injury, the prices are more ridiculous than trying to get through rush hour on the Strip. My family and I really enjoy fine dining-- typically in Vegas-- so we were prepared for the extreme price tags that typically come with the higher-end dining.

Horrible service and subpar food for the price (a price that could probably feed Ethiopa until 3013).

The whole thing just fell apart in my hands, and it really was too big. The veggies didn't really seem the freshest, either.

I ordered the queso, which to their credit is served in a small size for only $2 instead of the large bowl for $4 in case you are dining alone or not wanting to share your cheese dip.  The cheese dip was meh - very thick.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing special.  The beef chimichanga was a hot mess.  Served with rice and beans, the rice was fine, the beans were runny (not appetizing).  The chimichanga, which is essentially a deep fried burrito, was covered with lettuce and such, sour cream on top of that, red sauce and then tomato slices, which completely saturated the chimichanga and made the fried outer shell mushy.  I like the crisp, which is why I got a fried dish - if I wanted a soft exterior, I would have ordered a burrito.  Meat filling was ... not in my top 10.  \n\nService was fine, I didn't run out of drink and that is important, but I found myself waiting for a bit for the check and then for her to pick it up.  Nothing was offensive or horrible, but overall it was just meh.  I should have gone to Azteca across the street or made the drive to Monterrey in Pineville.  Bleh.",0.0,0.997989296913147

The prices are still high and the furnishings - untouched - are hitting a new low. But what has really bottomed out is the kitchen.\n\nFour of us arrived for lunch at 12:30. The place was empty, and stayed so except for one other party of two. When we sat down, Ralph started to disappear under the table. The banquette had become unsprung. The laminate tabletop was peeling off in chunks. There was a sign on our table advertising summer specials. I'm wondering now why we stayed.\n\nKen and Ralph ordered the soup of the day ($ 5), which our waitress said was chicken and corn chowder. I asked for a pulled pork sandwich ($10) and mac & cheese($9), which I was going to share with Ken. Ralph also wanted the pulled pork, and Sandy ordered a chicken salad sandwich ($9). The sandwiches are served with a side of 5 grapes?!?!. A bag of chips cost an extra dollar. A side salad is an additional $2.50.\nSandy asked for a salad with a sesame dressing. The dressing that was served was an unidentifiable oil mixed with a touch of sesame oil - no vinegar or seasoning. It was awful. When she asked to exchange it for honey vinaigrette, she was served something orange flavored instead. The chowder contained no milk or cream. The bread on\nSandy's sandwich was inedibly stale. But the biggest gaffe of all was the pulled pork. Both sandwiches arrived at the table stone cold. Like just out of the refrigerator cold. The person in the kitchen, I wouldn't call him chef, couldn't even bring himself to put them in the microwave (which is a sin anyway). Ken, who is a bit of a conspiracy theorist, thinks that the kitchen staff is trying to sabotage the operation.

One year ago I loved Penn's Thai House. The awesome Jaime W. recommended this place, and she was right in recommending them. Penn's was good, so good that I went outside of my comfort zone to try different textures and flavors that I never thought I'd try. Lunch, dinner, persuading my family to pay a bit more and give them a try, I had Penn's at 5 stars and showed my support with my feet walking in the door and spending $50 minimum on my night orders and giving 25% tips for lunch.\n\nThat was then. The love I had for Penn's has been crushed. I visited about 2 months ago hoping to rekindle the love and happy Thai food experience I missed. Instead the food made my family sick and my sister in law said never again. I would pass over Sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at night...And wish for the old days. \n\nThen came word of Penn's making it onto the dreaded Channel 13 Dirty Dining segment. I read the story, SNHD said Penn's hired a top food safety expert to clean them up. I found myself craving good spicy Thai...and through strange circumstances I found myself with 45 minutes to spare and I'm 3 blocks away. Off I went...would I be able to find happiness again? Had the expert done his job? This is Vegas, sometimes you gotta take a chance....\n\nThe building is the same, but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and boring egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the Penn's I loved was gone. Tack on the extra $1 for using a debit card under $10 and service that was cold and aloof and when I walked out the door I said I was done. I believe in redemption and giving second chances. Penn's got that opportunity...and they blew it. \n\nWhen it was good, it warranted placement on my Mythical 6th Star list. Now it's just a waste of commercial space. \n\nBetter alternatives are less than 15 minutes away.

We absolutely hated our experience here. When we first arrived, the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us \""sir\"" and \""madam,\"" which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying. Little did I know that ~32 minutes later, we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly. The service was totally unimpressive, especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded, and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol, but what really turned us off was the overly sweet, sugary, and poorly-thought-out food. \n\nWe started with the \""Mill Avenue\"" appetizer sampler. The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all. We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them, we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers. My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated \""sauteed\"" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder. \n\nWhen the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning. With so much wrong, a complete overhaul would be necessary. And, so...we said \""We're just full. Thanks!\"" and got the hell out of there!",0.0,0.99950909614563

I said to him, \""well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter\"" to which he again chuckled and said, \""whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know\"" in an extremely condescending manner.

I entered into a very meta space in which I started wondering whether the volume of the food, if stuffed into a plastic bag, would exceed the volume of my head, and what the percentage weight of my own pied was to the weight of this pied. Concluding that I would surely win a Darwin award for dying from complications of gastric bypass surgery if I tried to down this dish (because this pied sure as hell was not going to bypass by itself), I took 4 bites and called it a -very disappointing- night.\n\nAnd then the dilemma of what to do with the remains, which constituted a largely untouched dish. I considered dragging them home with me to make 10 gallons of stock, but since home is a 12 hour Amtrak ride away and my freezer really doesn't have that kind of spare capacity, I took a moment to apologize to the pig for a waste of a life, and said adios.\n\nIt is actually beyond my comprehension how one person could eat this dish.

This guy over did it.\n\nOn my 1st trip, I ordered the honey Dijon pork chops and they weren't too bad. The Dijon over powered the meat but I am glad that it did. The pork chop was dry and didn't have much flavor to it to begin with. The garlic mashed potatoes were pretty good, but that was about it. On this trip I ordered the French Quarter burger and specifically asked no pickle, tomato, or onions. Sadly, I had half an onion on my burger and pickles. Once I got through picking apart my burger and putting on mayo, it was OK. It had avocado pieces, swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing. \n\nFor dessert, I had the apple crisp. This was fantastic and I would recommend everybody to try it. They come in 2 sizes, a nice small portion, or a really big one where you have to have at least 2 people eating on it. It comes topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Something nice to have on a cold and rainy night. \n\nOverall, I don't think I will be going back here too often.

For that I apologize sincerely, but I can't control my brain, yo.\n\nThe point of that thought train is that subconsciously, I think this place already had a few marks going against it.  My friend and I have been for lunch a few times since it's so close to his office, and really the biggest surprise is that nothing is good, but nothing is really bad either...it's as bland as a dry wedding.  The worst offense being the \""signature\"" chicken fingers, which tasted like neither chicken, nor fingers.  It reminded me of that flavorless feast from \""A Wrinkle in Time\"".  L'Engled!\n\nThe wrap I had was alright, but this restaurant sets the bar pretty low.  I'm assuming this is a chain since it looks like an amalgam of every chain restaurant I have ever been to.  Little bit o' Fridays, mixed with a dose of Applebees, with just a hint of Damons thrown in.  It's menu and appearance are just super dull, and really, with a thousand cool restaurants so close, this seems like a terrible misstep.\n\nMy suggestion to the Red Ring marketing department: just embrace the fact that you've named your restaurant after an inflamed butthole and make your menu all about incredibly hot food challenges.

I waited at the pickup window for ten minutes before the guy looked up and asked me what I ordered.  When I told him he looked at me blankly, like he'd never heard of the Forbidden Sundae before.

I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.\n\nFor a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste.

There was NO indication of their being any bell peppers in the dish. I asked the waiter about it and he said, \""Oh, that's how they all come. It's a garnish.\"" Damn it! I never asked for no stinkin' garnish! So, I spent the entire night trying to eat my food while avoiding the damn bell peppers. I'm sure I got one or two but luckily, I took a benadryl just before I started to eat. Stupid people! I was upset. It was slightly my bad for not knowing about the garnish. . . but DAMN he could have offered to have it taken off or to replace my dish. GRR! stupid dude!!

It's right between work and home and it seems like it should be as good as it is convenient. It's just not. The first visit there they served raw fries coated in fryer grease. When we spoke up about it, the owner said \""well, it was taking too long to cook, so we just served it\"". Maybe they thought we were to dumb to notice? If a Rigas Diner can't even get french fries right then you can probably imagine just how really bad the more complicated items are... Well, they are worse than that.\nAfter that, I pretty much gave up on Rigas Diner.

As we entered, I was surprised at how big the place was. Everyone was extremely friendly, and we escorted directly to a booth. Despite the fact that we were we seated immediately, it took a while before someone came and took our drink orders.\n\nWhen our was finally taken, it seemed as if it took a while for our food to arrive.  It can be a very frustrating feeling when you arrive at a locale before others and you see them get their food, finish their meal and pay before your own food ever arrives!\n\nI was literally salivating in anticipation for our meal to arrive at our table.  Once it finally made it, my girlfriend and I immediately dug in.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders w/fries and a side of collard greens.  She said the collard green were just okay... they were not seasoned with any kind of meat and were bland. She enjoyed the tenders, saying they were, \""moist and tender\"".  I tasted the chicken tenders and can concur - they were excellent.  Some of the best tenders Ive had around Charlotte.  However, we both gave the fries a thumbs-down.  They weren't crisp or hot.  In fact they were the exact opposite - soft and room temperature. \n\nI ordered the Midnight Special with my eggs being scrambled w/cheese, bacon, hash browns \""covered and smothered\"", and I was allowed to substitute a pecan waffle for just $.50 more.  Everything was cooked to my liking.  The hash browns were PERFECT.  I thought the eggs were a little hard.  I prefer my scrambled eggs light and fluffy. \n\nThe best feature of Midnight Diner is its versatility.  You can go there early in the morning before work, for lunch, or late - after a night of carousing with friends.  In addition, they have any and everything you could possibly want to eat, and breakfast is served all day! \n\nI felt like my experience at Midnight Diner was lessened by the service, because the food was above par.  Yes, our waitress was extremely cordial, but she was anything but prompt.  I went there looking to be in-and-out quickly and was greatly disappointed. \n\nIn closing, I've heard so much good stuff about this spot that I def want to go there again.

Paper-thin, overdone patty; decent veggies; bun was soggy... Just too gross to eat. Fries were also soggy and underdone, but ok to eat. I also had a milkshake that almost passed as decent except for the strange whip cream and cherry job. The cherry was flattened and whip cream was strangely distributed. Looked like a 5 year old made it. I've had better at fast food chains. My partner had a chicken salad which looked good - I'd get that if forced to go back.\n\nAtmosphere... Lots of screaming children. If you like Johnny rockets, you might like the decor. Mostly clean. Downtrodden staff.\n\nThe food is relatively cheap, but it's just bad. If you want something cheap, there's a hot dog cart on the casino floor that sells 75 cent hit dogs. Coronado cafe is also a better option; spend a little extra, get so much more!

He did bring a small plate of vermicelli for me to add, upon seeing how little the chef had put in.  As I was eating I noticed that there was not the typical subtle mint flavor I'm used to in Bun.  So, the next time the server came around I asked, \""isn't there supposed to be mint in here?\"" He said he didn't know but looked at a menu and sure enough, mint was on the list of ingredients. He brought me a small bowl of wilted mint, which I used.  Thank goodness the sauce was tasty or there would have been little to redeem this salad.  They ALSO FORGOT to include the \""crispy shallots and peanuts\"" that were supposed to be in the salad too.  I didn't know this til I got home and re-examined the menu.  I just knew something else was missing, because usually Bun is an explosion of flavors.  I thought $10 was way too much to pay for what I got, not to mention the strange service.  OH and get this! My bill came to $10.83. I gave the guy $15 and he came back with $4, saying \""I rounded up to $4.\""  I said \""oh, ok thanks,\"" but then I realized that he stiffed me .17.  I mean yeah, big deal, .17.  But come on, how cheesy is that, to make change off of your customer's pocket book!! It's laughable how bad this lunch experience was.  And the tamarind sauce splattered high up on the window moulding in front room didn't help.  This place is stupid.",0.0,0.9994980096817015

Arriving at 7:30 on a Saturday night, and the ONLY car in the parking lot should have swayed us away, but already there, and in the mood for Thai, we ventured in. We ordered 3 Samurai Pad That with shrimp, and an orange chicken. While waiting for our meal, we took in our surroundings noticing several cloudy/merky and open fish tanks, electrical cords taped to the floor, and just an overall \""dirty\"" feel to the place. We've enjoyed some amazing meals in \""humble\"" hole in the wall restaurants overseas, humble is one thing, but there is no excuse for DIRTY!

(We were the ONLY people in the place, so no \""rush\"" in the kitchen) My Samurai Pad Thai consisted of half a plate of  plain undressed iceberg lettuce with a couple threads of carrot (was that an attempt at salad, or a very large garnish?? Not sure.)  The Pad Thai was very oily, void of vegetables, no peanuts, and basically just a half plate of noodles with a couple pieces of cilantro tossed in. Four small breaded shrimp adorned the plate, and after adding a hearty dose of chili to flavor..was just above eatable as a whole. I'd eaten half my meal before my friends dinner arrived. \n                                                                                                                                  \nOur bill arrived with a mysterious additional $13 charge added.

(Free clue: If people aren't tipping well, they felt the service was substandard or POOR!) Obviously, no interest  here in creating loyal and happy customers, OR a decent dining experience, just a 'penny wise-dollar short' mentality. Yuk!\n\nVERY BAD experience overall!!

A few problems, nothing major. The food was good... not great, but good.\n\nThe long version: A friend and I met up here for lunch yesterday. Even though it was noon, the service was quick. Unfortunately, the floor was had been mopped with something that left a slick residue, and my friend (who was wearing flip flops) had to quickly find a seat so as not to fall. I, however, was wearing boots with heavy tread, so I had no problem. Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we sat down, and it was fresh and enjoyable, though it didn't stand out from other burgers I've had at places like 5 Guys. (I had the Paradise Valley Cheese Burger). The table was wobbly, and it was annoying enough to make me want to change places, but we were engrossed in conversation, so I decided to try to ignore it. The server did come around once to clear away trash and ask if we needed anything, and I wasn't expecting extra attention in a casual burger joint, so that was nice. However, when we left the restaurant at 1:30, the trash can that had been filled to overflowing during the lunch rush had not yet been emptied. That would have been gross enough on its own, but someone had spilled guacamole all over the opening of the trash can, down the side, and onto the floor in front of the can. This was the kind of trash can that you have to push open the flap on the front in order to dump your garbage inside, so it was rather disgusting to have to deal with that. \n\nFor the two of us, lunch was about $22. That got us one burger, one side, and an ice water each.\n\nSo, overall, it was a pretty decent place to grab a quick, freshly-made hot meal. Just don't expect too much.",0.0,0.6154150366783142

And just giving you one napkin. Is there a napkin shortage I haven't heard about? Just put the napkins and cutlery on the table and let us do it ourselves! That would mean fewer encounters for the rude staff to endure too. \""One fork, one napkin and one menu,\"" as John Lee Hooker didn't sing. Sort it out!\n\nSo why do I go back? The food. Absolutely delicious. Under five pounds for a tasty stir fry or soup, with free green tea. Of course I always spend more as I can't resist the crispy chilli beef strips for a starter (see photos).\n\nIt's just the kind of place that Edinburgh needed - no frills, cheap and cheerful noodle house in the centre of town.

Ouch.\n\nAfter my previous amazing meal at MG, I had been going on about wanting to return for over a year.  So, The Man surprised me by booking lunch here on NYE.  \n\nMy first visit was when the restaurant was located on Picardy Place.  Unfortunately I found that the move to N Castle Terrace resulted in a downgrade in surroundings as well as food.  \n\nWhen eating at a restaurant that is aiming for a Michelin star, you don't expect the wait staff to wear dirty uniforms that are missing buttons, and you don't expect the stairwell to the toilets to be scuffed and dirty.  Once you get to the bottom of the scruffy stairs, you are in a cold, dank corridor that leads you to toilets that were \""upgraded\"" by painting the tiles black.  Tiles + paint + time = scratches and general shabbiness.  So far, nothing particularly rang of \""fine dining.\""\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the standard of food was what I remembered.  My starter (a veloute) was tasty though a bit uninteresting, and in The Man's pan fried duck egg, the duck egg itself was undercooked to the point of still having clear eggy slime on the top.\n\nI opted for the slow cooked pork belly that stole my heart on my previous visit, and The Man had what I believe must have been the oven roasted salmon.  He *loved* the soft shelled crab but found the rest of the dish to be standard fare.  My pork belly was nice but dry and lacking in some kind of oomph.\n\nThe theme here is that the food was perfectly nice, but wasn't exciting.  Everything was absolutely fine but not what I expected from Mark Greenaway.   I'm probably being too extreme in my opinions considering we had three courses for \u00a320 which is a fabulous deal, but if I had paid full price for the food I would have been UNimpressed.  \n\nThe bright star of the meal was the maitre d'/sommelier.

But now that they're almost a full year in - the shining example they displayed with great food and service during their opening month, has dwindled severely.\n\nThe reason for the re-view and severe star-docking?  Their consistency in food quality and service is non-existent at this location.  Jordan and I walk over there at least once-twice a week when we don't want to cook, and we have discovered that the only good time to go and get awesome food, is a busy Saturday night, because that's when the best line cooks and servers are scheduled to work.  If we go on a not-so-busy afternoon or weekday evening, our food sucks, and the service is even worse.  And ordering To Go isn't really a time-saver since the Bartender will ignore you.\n\nI will leave out server and bartender names, just to be polite, but MULTIPLE servers (and I mean MULTIPLE) here, are just the worst in the city.  They're forgetful, slow, and always diffusing responsibility to a faceless kitchen.  On those days that we would go in the afternoon, every server on the floor is still visibly drunk and/or high from the night before, and audibly bragging about it.  Not that I care that people are drunk and/or high - but just be sure you can still function at a basic human level if those are your life choices.  \n\nMy favorite things on the menu are the Angry Hippie Burrito, Foo-Foo Fajitas, and the Tofu Tacos.  Now when we go on a Saturday night - these plates are BANGIN' and totally delicious.  I crave the Tofu Tacos because they're so unique and so filling - whatever that glaze is on the tofu - I can't recreate it at home, unfortunately (and we have TRIED!).  I have to go to Mad Mad to enjoy my Tofu Taco craving.  The Angry Hippie Burrito is freaking awesome too, because it's enormous and there's tons of veggie goodness in it (if it's not overly dominated by black beans).  The Foo-Foo Fajitas - portobello and tofu and a party of other veggies (zucchini, corn, onions, peppers) - just makes love to your face once the skillet passes in front of you.  \n\nThough the wait times are long on weekends, you will mostly likely have a better food and service experience.

The set up borders on diner with the exposed kitchen & extremely noisy bussing area, but then they throw in linen table cloths like its fine dining. Pick one- noisy bistro or quiet dining.

So when I sat for them to make a sandwich (and it wasn't incredibly busy inside) the waiter was just TOO chatty. Finally, a good 10 minutes later, I got my sandwich and left.

So as I waited another 10 minutes the chatty man kept saying things like \""oh they're roasting things now, especially for you, it will be better\"" (started to have a growing anger towards him). \n\nTen minutes passed and I became impatient and didn't even want a sandwich at this point. Finally when I got the sandwich, left, got across the street, opened it, i found 3 dinky pieces of roasted red pepper. That was hardly roasted. NOW! That was terrible.

Also for some reason they through in some non-battered zucchini and squash.  Right into the fryer!  Why?  They are very pourous vegetables and absorbed so much oil they weighed as much as silver dollars!  Bleccch.\n\nLikewise their asparagus was awful.  Paired with some kind of meat (hello?!?!  Wrap it in cream cheese and pancetta?!?!?!) and there was no evidence of the promised cheese in there.  Then they were wrapped in some kind of dough and appeared to be thrown into the fryer.  Heavy heavy heavy.  Limp, grease-soaked asparagus.

I was also invited to what I thought was \""complimentary\"" food and appetizers. I saw nothing of the sort. Nope, a server told me there was a $25 VIP fee for a fixed menu that you could order off of. Myself and 2 friends were starving. We decided to stay and just order some food and drinks, at least give it a try. After about 40 minutes of waiting, our server informed us that the order couldn't even be put in until 8PM (20 min. later), which is when the full menu would open up to the non-VIP people. We lamented for a bit and contemplated going to Ra Sushi instead. But our server was clearly making a good effort to keep us there by giving us a round of free drinks and a free appetizer, so we stayed. While the drinks were good, the appetizer was boring and cold. It was little tiny grilled cheeses with a slice of tomato on top. They were a little stale actually and the sauce on the tomatoes was unpleasant. I was the only one who ate them, but mostly because I was so incredibly hungry I couldn't help myself! I order their grilled chicken salad which was $10. The price was good, but the salad was filled with mostly iceberg lettuce. I freaking HATE iceberg lettuce. It's like the garbage of lettuce. I picked around it and basically ate all the other ingredients. It wasn't bad necessarily, just overall not an impressive salad whatsoever. Furthermore, their appetizer/snack selection was so bizarre. Nothing but their $9 french fries sounded good, which is way too expensive. I don't want fried pig ear, brussel sprouts, fried cauliflower or whatever other wannabe-eclectic shit you're offering. It's totally fine to put unusual things on the menu, but every single snack item sounded horribly unappetizing. Lastly, there were like a bazillion flies outside. Quote: \""I have to squint so I don't get flies in my eyes.\""\n\nThe entire event was honestly a waste of my time. I really doubt I'll be going back to try anything, not with sushi right next door. I do thank our server lookalike Anne Hathaway for the effort though.\n\nOh, and whoever designed your menu needs to find a damned high-res version of your logo.

Hopefully, he'll get a chance to read about it in this review. \n\nWe got to BurGR around 7 pm and waited between 40-45 minutes--to be seated at the bar. Beware. BurGR does not take reservations and they operate on a first come first serve basis. Be prepared to wait between the hours of 4-9 pm.

Had my bf and I opt for a table, our wait would have been much longer. The bar area has several large TV screens tuned to sports channels so if you enjoy sports, it's something to consider. Also, the bar chairs are glued into the ground with an awkward space in-between.

We were offered our waters and we waited another 10-15 minutes for our food. \n\nThe one word I would use to describe the food: underwhelming. My salad was just a pile of greens with slices of apples placed on top with some pieces of Parmesan cheese and croutons sprinkled throughout. It was unimpressive and tasted like any other Caesar salad, with or without granny apples. My salad was hardly justified by its exorbitant price of $12. Especially, when I know I could have purchased the same salad at Trader Joes for half the price. \n\nMy bf's burger looked better but after a few bites, he said his burger was dry and well done, not medium, which was what he had asked for. I tried some of the meat and agreed: it was well done, not medium. \n\nBottom line: This was a rookie's mistake and unacceptable in a well-established Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Paired with my ordinary salad, the burger was not up to par with a restaurant only specializing in burgers. If this is their niche, they need to step up quality control and not let this happen in the future. I will not be returning for more sad salads, over done burgers and long lines.  \n\n*End rage.",0.0,0.9975578784942628

I had the brisket sandwich which should be served on a heartier bread.  The square rye sandwich bread cannot hold this sandwich and by the time it reached the table was a soggy, sloppy mess.  On top of that the food took an incredibly long time to come out and the place was not even half full, not even close.  The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.

Easy to boost from the fridge, stuff into the trash without making any noise, and usually just enough food to get me to the afternoon break.  One small drawback.\n\nGrabbagreen only sells healthy stuff, like quinoa and kale and such. They're big on smoothies too, although I've never sampled one yet since they don't tend to make it to the fridge. I thought about trying Ramona's the other day when she went to the bathroom, but she's been pretty sick lately and I didn't want whatever it is she has. \n\nAnyway, I had some quinoa mixed with chicken, kalmata olives, red onions and red roasted peppers. Not exactly what I would've ordered but I'm not complaining. Miranda's leftovers, (name on box) were far less appealing. Way too green, looked like snot with all that avocado. Not sure what it was.\n\nSo I'm giving Miranda, whoever the fuck Miranda is, no stars for her obvious lack of menu prowess.\nRamona also gets 0 stars. Mainly for hacking up shit all day and not covering her mouth. I'll be lucky if I don't get some kind of communicable disease.

What little she managed to leave behind was damned tasty, but then she thought so too apparently. What a hog.\n\nI always hear the girls talk about how expensive grabbagreen is, but I don't happen to share their opinion. I think its extremely reasonable.\nFor now, I'll have to be content with them only going on payday. I hope Ramona gets better soon.

I went online to read their menu and saw that this place is pretty expensive for what it is.  Entrees DO NOT include salad or soup.  The waitress will offer it, but know that each costs $5.00 extra.  \n\nThe navy bean soup was bland.  No ham.  Needed something.  Wasn't served with crackers.  Just a small bowl on a big plate.  \n\nIt took forever for the food to arrive and the place wasn't that busy.  It was a weeknight.  No waiting.  Tables open nearby.\n\nOrdered the Southwest Chicken Salad for $11.50!  It had a little bit of BBQ flavored chicken on it and the dressing was sweet.  Wouldn't a Southwest salad have a little kick?  Not to my liking at all.  And not worth the price!  \n\nMy husband had the $11.00 Gaucho burger with guacamole that the waitress raved about. The bun had a skimpy smear of guacamole and the bun arrived really soggy.  No lettuce, no tomato, no garnish, no pickle.  Just the soggy burger and cold fries, which she did replace for us.  \n\nOne of our group ordered salmon.  $17.95.  Again, no SOUP OR SALAD INCLUDED.  The salmon was good, but there were maybe 5 tiny shriveled potatoes on the plate under the salmon.  The asparagus, though skimpy, was tasty.  \n\nThe waitress was very good.  The manager stopped by and we pointed out the issue with the fries being cold and the burger being soggy.  He said it was the 3rd complaint he's had with the soggy burgers.  Well, don't you think you should fix the problem?  Unreal!  \n\nVery noisy place.  Hard to hold a conversation.

To be fair, it was 9 p.m. on a Tuesday. Considering that there were almost no other tables to take care of, the service was acceptable, but not great.

The waffle in our Cock-a-Waffle-Doo (try and order it without sounding ridiculous) was completely unheated - and no where was it mentioned that the chicken is entirely dark meat.

If it were an interactive device, I would've told it to not be coy with me.\n\nIn addition to the smart phone debate, the place doesn't have a website, in which I wish it did. I was trying to get my Sushi-Loving-But-Worried friend to warm up to a new place she hadn't been to before. So, without the site and not necessarily relying on other reviewer's opinions, I stopped by there just to get brochures, pamphlets, menus and health inspection notifications. Luckily, the latter had all fifteen of them marked: Now Meets Substandard Quality.\n\nOkay, that last part was a joke, but I did get the very colorful menu and convinced her to broaden her palate. We did go, in fact, and it was DELICIOUS! I do love Sushi, but unfortunately, I don't get to go to the high end places, so mine's limited to good-to-buffet style. I write that so you know where my experience comes from. (I also liked Todai, but I don't believe it's here in AZ anymore.)\n\nWe both got the all-you-can-eat, which is, in fact, limited to what you can eat. Any leftovers and they're supposed to charge you. My father always told me my eyes got bigger than my stomach, and they did here. I thought we ordered 6 items altogether, and each items include what, 6-8 pieces each?\n\nTurns out we only ordered 4, and half way through we told our excellent waitress that if we had ordered any more: CANCEL! She confirmed this was all we asked for. Between me and my friend, we couldn't even finish all four. I wish I remembered what \""states\"" (meaning types of Sushi) we ordered, but I do remember the last: The Rhode Island. That was HOT, but enormously delicious. Too bad I could only eat two pieces before I was spent.\n\nHere's great customer service: It was our first time there, and I knew we ordered more than we could eat, so I was prepared to pay the piper. Our waitress left us and came back after speaking with someone else and told us that we didn't have to pay full price because overall we didn't order much. Thank goodness! With tip and all, it came to roughly $80 - out of my own pocket. And we didn't even get the Sake Bombers I so wanted.\n\nAdvice: Unless you're a heavy eater, which I am not, order just individual items. It could save you a bunch from the All-You-Can-Put-Away prices.\n\nOverall, the place is clean, quaint, really beautiful inside - small enough for intimacy and a great and helpful staff. Honestly, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the place and would recommend to all.  I would say they need to learn about an up'n'coming new international media device most people have on their laptops, but other than that, enjoy!",0.0,0.9572972059249878
