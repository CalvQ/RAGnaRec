(I have salt water fish, so my experience, and thus my review, are based solely on their salt water selection, not their fresh water)\nOn the plus side, they always have an above average selection of fish.\nMany of the smaller stores will fall back on stocking ONLY small, less-expensive fish, that are either safe choices because they will definitely sell, or safe choices because they are hardy enough to last until they do. \nTrop actually goes out on a limb, and regularly stocks some really amazing specimens, which is somewhat rare in the industry, because it's a gamble for a store to buy livestock in the $100+ range, and run the risk of having the fish die before they sell it. It shows that they have a confidence in their aquatic system, and the knowledge to be able to responsibly sustain life.\n\nOn the downside, there are only a couple of people that work there that have ACTUAL knowledge. So when you ask a question, sometimes you will get an honest answer from a knowledgeable, responsible adult. Other times, you will get a younger person, who instead of admitting that they don't know, they will make something up. I hate that, and I have tested that theory many times in this store, as I myself have a pretty good knowledge of the hobby, so I'll often throw out test questions to gauge their integrity. \nAlso, they'll sell you anything you want to buy, without asking compatibility questions,  and without telling you (or possibly without knowing) that something is wrong with a fish. You can ask, \""Is this fish eating?\"", and the answer will always be yes, but I have found that it is smarter to ask if they'll toss some food in, so that I can gauge for myself.\nThe only other drawback, is that this store is very expensive, where the same products and livestock at the other store I frequent (review to come) are MUCH more reasonable, but I weigh that against the 25min drive, and this store usually wins out as a matter of convenience.\nSo in short, this can be a great place to buy salt water fish, but do your own homework, and observe and assess the fish yourself (perhaps over a week or 10 days) rather than taking their word for it.",0.0,0.9815086722373962

After testing my water (which had been done the day before) she reluctantly told me that she would give me $2.98 credit.  I said I just wanted to replace the fish I had returned with the same kind.  She said that they didn't have any more of them - so my ONLY option was to get something different - and PAY the difference.   I told her that I felt like I should get a fish of EQUAL VALUE to the sick one that I had returned.  She refused, and told me that I could take the $2.98 she had offered, or nothing at all.  Her attitude was incredibly snotty, and I opted for NOTHING, rather than deal with her.  Pissed-off, I told her where she could put both the sick fish and her puny $2.98 credit.  I left the store, after vowing to write this review, and never return as a customer.\nWhat a FOOLISH way to run a business!  They lost a customer who will spend about $250 - 300 in the next few months.  The woman 'helping' me (who appeared to be the manager) knew that I was going to return to buy a $120 light hood, and lots of the supplies that a new tank owner normally needs.  She lost nearly ONE HUNDRED TIMES in store business, over the $3.00 additional credit I was due.  Additionally, I will warn as many as possible NOT to shop at Trop-aquarium.\nI hope that future customers will be smarter than I was, and heed the warning to NOT SHOP AT TROP-AQUARIUM.",0.0,0.9996457099914552

I was generally happy until most recently.\n\nSF will only get one star from me due my recent experience at the store.\n\nLast week, I bought a few cucumbers and was charged for a case of cucumbers for $18.00.  No problem.  It was an honest mistake and I was refunded.\n\nYesterday, I was totally POed by one of the staff working in the seafood counter.  SF recently changed its policy - customers can no longer pick your own fish.  Employees behind the counter will need to help us pick now.  I personally think this policy change is a bad idea.  SF is wasting its time and money as most customers will want to pick the freshest fish.  Employees will be spending more time helping customers pick the right fish instead of spending time on other tasks.\n\nHere is what got me so upset.  A guy told me to read the new sign that I was not supposed to pick my own fish anymore.  Fine.  So, I asked him to help me pick a fish.  I asked him to open a gill of a tilapia and it did not look too good.  It was brown instead of red - an indication that the fish was not fresh.  So, I asked the guy to open a gill of the next poor tilapia.  It looked red, but it was a little too small.  So, I asked the guy to find me a tilapia with red gill and was a little bit bigger than the current one.  He was irritated and blurted out, \""You are like a girl\"".  Needless to say, I was pissed.\n\nI reported the incident at the seafood counter to the store manager (in English and in my broken Chinese).  A few minutes later, I noticed the store and the fish guy having a conversation that appeared to be a reprimand (at least it looked and sounded like it based on tone of voice of the manager - they were conversing in Vietnamese).\n\nTo SF Management:  If you happen to read this review, please change that fish policy back to let us pick our own fish.

No one is ever around. \n\nI love how they have Elephant Ear Bettas. I've never seen them anywhere else. I hate that they don't have prices near them. And they charge $20+ for EEs. When I was just recently in there a few days ago a lot of their bettas looked pretty bad. \n\nThe staff is very friendly. I've never had a problem with anyone there. The cashiers are always very nice and they like to strike up conversations with you while you check out. \n\nI think this store is WAY better then the petsmart across the street. I've never seen any dead or dying bettas. Their bettas only have some fun problems that can easily be fixed. \n\nThey also have some awesome bamboo shrimp! I had bought one and sadly he didn't live. I guess they are ok with selling old ones to people. The one I had gotten was fully grown and died of old age. When I was in there the other day I saw that they had smaller ones that are obviously young and that's when I figured out they had sold me an older one. I will get more of them but this time I'll make sure they are young.,1.0,0.8703435659408569

It's true!! I was given a fish from here once quite recently and I was thrilled with it!! Everyone had a fish tank in the 80s and I fancied myself as a bit of an 80s chick. Thus, I was given a fish. I came down here to buy all my accessories - food, tank etc etc.  The staff were  lovely! But the shop smelled. Within a week I came back and asked if they wanted the fish back. Turns out the fish life isn't the life for me.",1.0,0.986811339855194

Great store (near the In N Out), store is set up beautifully with LED lights, and the livestock look great. I get almost everything I need for my reef aquarium from here, and they order anything not in stock. Eric really cares about the animals, and won't pick up any special order fish (or sell them to customers) unless they are healthy. I can't speak highly enough of this shop, what a great local business to be able to support!",1.0,0.9986586570739746
