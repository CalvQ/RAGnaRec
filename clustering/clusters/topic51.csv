After she left to go on maternity leave, things began to go downhill. \nUnder her care I was prescribed an ultrasound due to uterine pain. I was not notified of her departure, but simply got a phone call from a stranger saying I had hemorrhagic cysts and polyps and that I needed a follow up ultrasound within 10 days of the start of my next cycle.\n\n Following the new doctors instructions exactly, I called the front desk to schedule my ultrasound, explaining to the receptionist on the phone that I needed to schedule an ultrasound within 10 days per the doctors instructions. The woman on the phone scheduled me for an appointment with the doctor very quickly, and considering I knew they did not always have ultrasound techs on staff (they have outside techs come in from an office called Fetal & Women's Center of Arizona) I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. I verified with her multiple times the time and the location of the appointment, that there would be ultrasound equipment and technicians on duty, and explained that due to my narrow window of time (10 days from the start of menstruation) how important it was to get this appointment done right. The woman's tone was dismissive but confident, and I let it go.\n\n Surely enough however, when I showed up for my appointment four days later the nurse on staff said they could not do my ultrasound and  casually closed my chart saying there must have been a misunderstanding because they did not have any ultrasound techs on duty on Thursdays. I was upset and asked to speak to a doctor. In the end I was treated rudely, dismissed, and told to reschedule my own appointment. \n\nUnfortunately, due to their irresponsible staff, I will now have to walk around with hemorrhagic cysts and polyps for another month (until after next menstruation), with no questions answered. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this office.\n\nLong story short - the staff does not listen, the office has multiple locations and outside ultrasound services which they seem incompetent about keeping track off, I was treated poorly and expected to fix their scheduling mistakes, I drove down to an office location despite their not being the resources necessary to perform my procedure and no one resolved this issue, and I will now have to wait until my next menstruation to discover more information about my ovarian cysts and polyps due to their oversight.",0.0,0.9979674220085144

I went in for a physical in May, he gave me two refills.  I used one of them, and it just ran out last week.  Like I said, I don't use it often.  When I went to fill my second refill, I was told it was only valid through November.  I thought, \""this must be some mistake\"".  I was very clear that I can only go to the doctor once a year, or I pay the entirety of the visit up to my deductible.  \n\nI thought, \""well I will just call the Doctor and he'll call in another one.

I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes to see the doctor and as I've said, I've been seeing Dr. Sawyer for over 13 years. \n\nAgain, I can't say enough nice things about Dr. Sawyer and his practice.

I took ibeprofen consistently but the pain wouldn't subside. I was told by multiple people it was probably appendicitis, so after days of pain, I went to the hospital. They had no rooms when I got to the ER. I waited an hour in horrible pain to even get my info in the system, then it was almost another hour before I was in a room. The nurses and staff were very friendly so it wasn't a big deal. After that I got a cat scan done, waited another hour did the doctor to tell me I have an abnormally large cyst on my ovary. The doctor, DR. KANG, told me this and ordered an ultrasound. After a couple more hours of waiting in a lot if pain he came back, repeated I have a cyst and sent me home to \""go to a gyno\"". Then he walked out. After HOURS he didn't even tell me how big the cyst was and gave no further information besides to take 600 mg ibeprofen. When I explained that I had already been taking 800 ibeprofen for days and that's why I came to hospital, and if prescription ibeprofen worked I wouldn't have needed to come. I was on morphine while in the ER and was still in a huge amount of pain. I explained this practically in tears and he literally repeated his sentences and refused other treatment. I started bawling from pain and frustration and he responded with \""I'm not prescribing you opiates\"". I was COMPLETELY and utterly offended. I work 70 hour weeks and I consider myself to be responsible woman, and I can't work those hours in this kind of pain. I felt as if I was being made out as a person with a drug issue because I'm younger (24) and ibeprofen doesn't work on me. I explained how I felt and told him how I felt that he was treating me unfairly and unprofessionally. Especially by not even taking more than 30 seconds to explain what was wrong with me. He didn't even let me finish my sentence before He immediately got defensive, raised his voice, saying he told me it was a cyst and if I wanted to know the size then he would just show me the paperwork and then snapped that he would write me a different prescription and walked out. I immediately burst in to tears again. I felt as if they were just trying to get me out of the hospital without a care to my health. All he thought I cared about was getting a prescription when I was more concerned about the cyst GROWING INSIDE ME. The other staff was nice but he was very insensitive and rude the minute I stood up and told him how I felt. He treated me as an unruly 20 year old instead of a young woman in excruciating pain. I have been using arrowhead for quite some time but after today I will never go again. After six hours, $100's of my money, and still having an enormous amount of pain.

It's everything else.\n\nIf you call for an appointment, be ready to wait on hold for at least 10 minutes before you get to talk to someone...every single time.  I've waited for 25 minutes before getting tired and hanging up.  And I can't forget the time that I'd already been on hold for 15 minutes when the main St. Joe's operator picked up and told me that the entire Peppertree staff had just left for lunch and wouldn't be back for another hour or so.

In the year and a half I went to Peppertree, I saw 4 different doctors.  The first doctor I saw there ended up moving but I wasn't informed until I went to make a follow up appointment with her.  No letter informing me of her departure... nothing.  I started seeing a new one but when I needed a certain lady procedure, they said they'd only do it on a certain day and the doctor that had already been up in my business wasn't working then.  So someone else got to poke around up in there.  There are more stories, but I think I've made my point.\n\nFinally, after making the decision to switch, I went in to fill out all the paperwork to obtain my medical records.  It's been a month and I still don't have them.  I called to follow up and I was transferred FIVE times because no one thought it was their responsibility.  Eventually I end up with someone who was able (willing?) to track down my request...she says they were sent.  I never got them.  No problem, she says, she'll send them again... but it's going to have to be 10 cents a page. \n\n*facepalm*",0.0,0.9986315369606018

I now have been without meds for 3 days now! How thoughtful of Walgreen's to communicate with their customers! I called today and the pharmacist says now that we had the notices on our counter, I said I use your drive through service why could one of your Pharmacy Tech's enclose that notice when I had made 2 previous visits in the drive through! I called my companies medical provider Express Scripts and they said no problem, and in Nevada you can receive 3 months worth regardless of the new law Walgreen's did not even tell me that nor did the Pharmacist say we have a mailing service that would assist you better!

My husband has had back pain on and off for quite sometime now.  Back in November it got to the point that he could barely walk.  We went and saw our primary doctor (Tom Peters) who was great.  Took lots of time with us to answer questions and note history.  We left there feeling better like we were finally going to get some answers.  He had my husband go for an MRI and got us in immediately after to go over.  He found a few things that were of concern to him and suggested we go to a specialist.  He recommended Dr. Bassewitz.  I had actually heard some great things about him from other people so we were happy about that.  That brings us to today.  \n\nMy husband got to the appointment (9:50am) and they did an X-Ray on his back.  Then they put him in a room for 2 hours!!!!!  No one comes in to check or anything.  The doctor finally arrives with some story about Govt mandate.  Sorry we have had an appointment for weeks, perhaps that appointment could have been the one to wait for 2 hours????  \n\nSo after all that, he must have been ready for lunch as he only spent all about 5 minutes to say, \""sorry nothing there, you have a normal back for your age\"" and dismissed him!!!!  \n\nHow disappointing!!!  Is it normal to have constant pain?????????  I would NEVER recommend this doctor to anyone.  My next call will be back to Dr. Peters to also share the experience with them so they don't think this is the place to send their patients.

So I went in and was seen by a new assistant who stated she had just started working there. Ok, the doctor may be busy, but I thought I had scheduled my appointment with Dr. Hunt? \n\nI explained that my IUD was MIA and needed reassurance on what to do next. After my exam, the assistant confirmed it was MIA and told me I needed to book an operating room to have it removed. I asked her several questions, but she kept telling me she wasn't sure. I appreciated the honesty, but when paying for an office visit, I do expect answers or a referral to someone who can answer my questions. She handed me off to the front desk. Yikes, I would have like some reassurance or explanation since I've never had any type of procedure, or broken bone, or anything that requires anything longer than an hour appointment for anything! \n\nThe front desk seemed annoyed when I asked how to find an OR or to see how much this was going to cost. They said they would have Dr. Hunt call me and they would try to get a \""quote\"" from insurance companies. So a few days later I received a phone call from an employee attempting to book the OR procedure. I explained I still wasn't sure what was going on... Did they know how much the procedure was going to cost? Could I drive home afterward? Did I need to take time off work? What was going to happen? Again was told Dr. Hunt would call me.

He'd been on over +6 very strong courses of antibiotics & was told  he need another course for a new symptom (a prostate infection)-so my husband began his 7th course of strong antibiotics. But he was concerned since he'd been feeling so ill from all the previous courses of antibiotics & read that antibiotics can cause fungal infections & fungal infections can cause prostate infections! So wanting to make sure he'd get better not worse or end up on more antibiotics we called to ask the Doctor 1) if an anti fungal would help after he finished antibiotics to which he said \""no\"" 2) we asked the nurse if she would ask him if fungal infections can be a cause for prostate infections especially Since he'd been on so many? We absolutely meant no harm by asking the question, it was a legitimate question to help my husband so he could get better. The nurse said he'd give us a referral to a Urologist & we'd planned on taking that just as soon as he could stop back in after this last course of antibiotics to see if the urine culture showed clear or not, but he was not given the chance to even come back in to see if the antibiotics Dr. Hoag prescribed cleared the infection or not because we got a shocking Certified Letter saying Dr. Hoag would no longer treat my husband because he refused to follow his medical advise! That is absolutely not true! Dr. Hoag put my husbands health at risk by cancelling him as a patient before allowing him a follow up after the antibiotics were done. When I called the nurse in his office for clarification,, she said \""He cancelled your husband as a patient because you asked twice about the anti fungal after he already told you NO!\""  Not TRUE we didn't ask twice! We asked once if a fungal infection can cause a prostate infection & once if he thought an anti fungal could help\"" We accepted his advice but he was steamed that we dared to even ask in the first place I guess? Something is seriously wrong when a Doctor decides to PUNISH & SHAME you for asking him a question in regards to your health.

At my first opportunity, I called to make an appointment to see if I could finally find someone that would help me get to the bottom of my imbalances. My experience was nothing but awesome from that very first phone call. They answered my questions regarding billing, cost of services, etc, without making me feel rushed. They scheduled me with Dr. Whaley and she was also an absolute delight! I actually felt \""heard\"" for the first time in my life!\n\nDr. Whaley was eager to do thorough testing to get a completely accurate picture of what is really going on with me. She answered all my questions, even the ones I didn't think to ask. She was incredibly informative, compassionate, and willing to work WITH me as a part of my healing team. She drew some conclusions about what might be going on and encouraged me to do research and contact her directly with any further questions. When my labs came back, she went through line by line, helping me understand all the good and no-so-good levels. As it turns out, her suspicions were accurate and now I am well on my way to recovering from decades of feeling like dog shit!\n\nI look forward to bringing certain members of my family in to begin their road to recovery, as well. Thank you, Dr. Whaley, for taking as much time as was needed to make me feel comfortable and supported! Thank you, Dr. McCarthy, for bringing her onto your team!",1.0,0.9987598657608032

She didn't rush through the exam and answered the questions that I had thoroughly.  Of course, the whole thing probably took less than ten minutes.

I was concerned about a blood clot or something.  I had my sister take me to the San Martin hospital where I had seen my father had good care.  My visit was post Obama Care and my fathers was pre-Obama Care.  I have a high deductible as a result of Obama Care so I could keep my insurance.  Upon being seen, I was told not to provide any financial or insurance information.  I was put in a reclining chair and asked if I did any drugs, needle drugs, illegal drugs and so on.  I answered the questions without being offended.  Another nurse came over and asked the same questions. I answered the same way, I have never done drugs.  I was asked If I had multiple partners.  I am married.  A third nurse came over and asked me the same questions about drugs.  Now I am offended and I said hell no!  I received a shot of morphine for the pain at this point, I am taken for an X-ray.  After the X-ray, the Dr. comes in, asks me if I have taken any pills or drugs in the last 48 hours, I stated only the morphine the hospital gave me and he said\"" I have looked at your X-ray and nothing is broken.  \""I do not know what is causing the pain.  You will have to have an MRI to determine if this is a blood clot or another sort of injury. \""  He left and so did I with the same problem I came in with.

This was my girlfriend's OBGYN for over a year. Shortly after we got pregnant and was seeing Dr. Tabassi for the baby. Well first off, this office is truly off the hook when it comes to scheduling and hold true to their appointment times. Several times we have been there waiting to be seen for at least 2 hours, at the most 3 1/2 hours. Dr Tabassi is a nice lady but I question her bed side manner. My girlfriend had a low placenta and Dr. Tabassi told her she is most likely to bleed out and hemorrhage if we have a natural birth but she doesn't recommend that we have a C-section?! Secondly, the staff is absolutely clueless. Pauline, the office manager cant run the office efficiently. she cant resolve issues the customer has. Honestly, im surprised she has a job with her work ethic. The only one that somewhat has a clue is Vanessa. Tabassi, for what ever reason was feeding us lines about my girlfriend's pregnancy while the high risk pregnancy doctor (referred by Dr. Tabassi)was telling us the complete opposite. And all the while bring a patient of Tabassi, we find out that she is juicing our insurance. After we found out about this we changed OBGYN to a different office. After we left their care, they continued the attempts to charge our insurance. We found out from our new doctor that they were doing tests that was supposed to be done by the high risk doctors. Lastly, the last time  we visited this office was in April, the same month we left her. Up to this day, they haven't returned our labor and delivery fees they collected from us forcing us to come out of pocket a second time to pay the new doctor. We are currently in talks with the Medical Board and a lawyer about our situation and also considering contacting Channel 13 Action news.

I said fine but can I please get a temporary prescription for this 1 month, I'm coming off my period and I need my birth control until I get the appointment. They didn't have any availability until September 4th anyway. I figured it was an easy request. Apparently it was, to them, an opportunity to bring up appointments I had missed from 2013 accusing me of making appointments only to obtain my birth control and never showing up. I tried to explain to them that I was not trying to deceive them, I was never told that I needed to see Dr.Tabassi in order to receive my birth control. Especially since I had been having it filled monthly since 2012 which was the last time I ever saw Dr.Tabassi so I didn't even know it was a requirement. To then be called a liar because \""everyone in the office knows that\"" but no one explained it to me. So fine I asked for the appointment and to please get 1 month of NuvaRing until the appointment date. So the ma keeps bringing up that I missed this many appointments etc etc until I finally got angry enough to tell her not to talk to me the way she was because again I had no idea that I needed to see her, I hadn't seen her since 2012 and I'd been getting my prescriptions since then. So she then tells me \""YOU KNOW WHAT? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR IM ENDING THIS CALL\"" and then she hung up on me. I'm most definitely not letting this go. She wants me to come in to see the dr because it's a \""liability\"" if she continues to write me prescriptions without knowing what's going on in my body yet here they have been giving me birth control without seeing me since 2012.

The MDs refused to refer my daughter to chiropractic for her migraines and wanted to push meds on a teenager.  When her dermatologist suggested birth control to help treat her acne, Dr. Mihic gave her the third degree about sexual activity and made her cry.  My insurance does not fully cover the cost of vaccine and I alerted staff that my children were VFC patients.  I was charged for the vaccine as they chose to use private for sale vaccine to make more money and NOT use VFC vaccine since I have insurance.

I couldn't see another doctor and I had no choice, I couldn't wait another hour and a half for the doctor to maybe show up! They have a very large sign that says they charge $125 if the patient doesn't cancel within 24 hours, if only that worked both ways. What a waste!",0.0,0.9945705533027648

I have had at least one visit with each doctor here.\n\nLet me start by saying, if you are looking for a doctors office that you can call with questions, this is not the place for you. This isn't a small practice with one or two doctors. I have had a couple times where I wasn't sure if I could take a medicine or just had a general question and I was told to ask my doctor at my next visit. While the office staff is not rude, this isn't very helpful when you have a cold that will probably be gone by the time your next visit comes around.\n\nThe doctors and the Quest Diagnostics staff that are here are all very nice. If you come in for a pap smear or a standard pregnancy visit they will be in and out within a couple minutes. If you have questions though, they will take the time to answer and discuss them. Being a first time mom with a history of miscarriages I was full of questions. My first couple of pregnancy visits were with Dr. Schoenhaus. She stayed and listened to all of my concerns and then asked if I would like a referral to a high risk doctor. At my next visit she went over my chart and had written notes about all of my previous questions and made sure I had gotten any answers I needed.\n\nIt is wonderful to have the Quest Diagnostic staff and an ultrasound tech on site because I do not have to go to a different location for blood work and ultrasounds. The only problem I've had with the blood work is that they only call and inform you of bad results. When I had my Gestational Diabetes test they never called me with the results. They have always called me with results if action had to be taken (i.e. a positive pregnancy test or a positive test for a genetic disorder), but sometimes you just want to know the results for sure instead of assuming or guessing until your next visit.\n\nOverall I would recommend Essential Women's to most people I know, but as I said in the beginning this isn't a small practice.

I finally decided to head in knowing my symptoms weren't ER worthy, but realizing that my primary care wouldn't be able to swab for the flu.  \n\nWhen I walked in I noticed a very strong scent.  Being sick, it was actually a little unbearable.  I wasn't sure if it was a strong cleaning product or a room deodorizer but I was really bothered by it! \n\nWhen I checked in at the front desk I asked the woman if they swabbed for the flu.  She said yes but that I'd probably be there for hours.  I wasn't sure if she was just informing me of the long wait, or discouraging me from waiting, but I proceeded to sign in.  \n\nThe good: I was only there a couple of hours in total, which was better than I though with how badly they were playing up the wait time.  The place was clean.  Plenty of seats in the waiting room.\n\nThe bad: One of the techs or medical assistants didn't introduce themselves when they came in to do a test on me.  When I received my discharge papers no one went over the prescription (side effects, how and when to take, etc.).  I'm not sure if this was because they knew I was in the healthcare field or not, but either way I would never hand my patients a prescription and then say, \""you're free to go.\""  \n\nIt's never fun to have to go to Urgent Care but if you really need to, this isn't a bad place to go.  It's better than waiting 8 hours and clogging up a busy ER with flu-like complaints, and it's probably more beneficial to you than waiting a few days to see your doctor.  I'd go again if needed.",0.0,0.9915665984153748

Our shortest wait was 1 hour. It usually takes about 2 hours to see your doc. Be prepared to kill your precious time in the office. The nurses are nice and friendly, but cannot say the same for the office staff! \n\nAlthough we saw Dr. Fleisher regularly throughout the pregnancy, we didn't get him for the delivery. Instead, and UNFORTUNATELY, we had Dr. REBECCA TYRE who was on call for the delivery. In all fairness, we knew from the onset that getting Dr. Fleisher was not guaranteed and that we could get any of the six doctors for the delivery. And we had hoped that it would be OK to have someone other than Dr. Fleisher for the delivery as we had developed a good relationship with him. \n\nNow, the perplexing thing is not that we had a HORRIFYING and TRAUMATIZING experience with DR. TYRE, but that it is almost an established fact that DR. TYRE universally and repeatedly gets bad reviews! And please go check as many webmd reviews as you wish! She is unacceptably unprofessional. Now my question is to the office, Green Valley OB GYN: Why do you still have TYRE on board despite the fact that she has an established track record of traumatizing your patients??? It is such a shame when her own colleagues from the same office badmouth her practice and professionalism big time, yet still keep her there and allow her to ruin people's most important and emotional moments... \n\nNow please read our personal experience with Tyre below if you think that I am a little too harsh and decide for yourself...\n\nWhen Tyre came in to the delivery room at St. Rose Dominican Hospital, she didn't even bother to greet us! First thing we heard from her was \""where are you from?\"" We knew that it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience, but she was on call that night! In only 15 minutes, she was able to traumatize us big time and to completely ruin the most magical and memorable moment of our life. Our daughter was born with a minor birth defect and Tyre broke it to us in an extremely unprofessional way. She looked at our baby and said \""what is wrong with this baby? Take \""it\"" and check \""it\""!\"" She didn't even let us enjoy our baby for one moment, shed happy tears, or celebrate the arrival of our precious angel. Then, of course, we completely freaked out, trying to figure out what was going on, but she refused to elaborate anything, stating that it wasn't her job to diagnose the newborn! \n\nA heartless and unprofessional woman, a monumental shame to her profession! She should not be involved with childbirth, one of the most emotional and magical human experiences ever.

I called to make an appointment and let his office know that I was a cash patient with no insurance and was looking for a specific type of doctor. I was never told that he does not write refills, but rather forces his patients to come into his office every month, which for a cash patient is initially $220 and then $150 every subsequent  month. He charges ridiculous fees too. He charges a $25 fee if you are more than SEVEN (7) minutes late to appointment and then they cancel the appointment and make you reschedule. This while I waited in his waiting room for almost 2 hours before I was taken back to a room and then waited another 30 minutes. They also charge a $50 fee to fill out paperwork that may be required by an insurance company, if it's more than 2 pages long!! Another Yelper wrote that she liked the tablet computers you use to do your paperwork on, but she perhaps didn't notice the additional fees they charge you to have digital paperwork/files. He refused to help me with the initial cost of the visit and told me he NEVER works with his patients if they cannot afford to see him. Apparently they would prefer to lose patients rather than help them out. Also when I called to make an initial appointment I was never told the doctor does not confer with other doctors, such as your prior doctor, and never writes refills. He also refuses to give patients additional medication if they run out over a weekend and can't get in to see him before they run out. Had I known about all this beforehand I would never have made an initial appointment. When I told that to the girl on the phone, she insisted that only two people make these types of appointments and they always tell the patients this. NOT!! Save yourself some serious hassles and stay away from this guy!! I've never seen a provider that refused to help out his patients monetarily if they are in a bind and really need help. I've never seen a provider that refused to speak with my old doctor in order to get additional information about me. And I've never seen a provider that refused to write refills and forced his patients to see him every month instead. Seriously, who does this? Oh yeah, Dr. Allen does!!

I have been going to this office for nearly 3 years, and I have never had a problem with them--they are courteous and professional. Before, I went to a different doctor at this location, with whom I was generally satisfied, but she moved out of state--so, I recently saw Dr. Hughes.\n\nMy main concern is that Dr. Hughes made NO effort to understand me or my concerns. I was a new patient for her, yet she was in and out of the exam room in less than 6 minutes. I ultimately left feeling upset and confused, when I should have felt reassured and and cared for. Overall, her questions were short and to the point, but there was much more information she could have gleaned--there was clearly no interest in me as a patient or as a human being.\n\nThere is a very important word in the Healthcare profession: CARE. I did not feel cared for at all by this physician. Furthermore, being in my mid-thirties, and at what I thought was an annual exam (she instead needlessly charged me as much as she could), I wanted to ask her about being mature and becoming pregnant for the first time. I wanted to learn about her as a physician, and specifically about her as an obstetrician--it was clear that Dr. Hughes had no time for or interest in such conversations. \n\nAlso very frustrating: this visit felt like a complete waste of my time and money. I went for an annual exam and simply mentioned that I have been having abdominal pain and wanted to ask about it. As a result, I was told I would have to come back for another appointment. --This is egregious. The whole point of preventative care is so that patients can ask about problems, BEFORE they are problems. What was done in that exam room should have been a part of a routine exam anyway. This makes me feel even more like I was not cared for as a human patient, but seen as a medical issue and dollar signs. I find this disrespectful of my time, as I have to leave work for appointments, and money, since my deductible for the visit was over $200 for all of under 6 minutes of contact with a doctor. \n\nAs a result, I am leaving Women's Specialty Care. I write this review not only so that Dr. Hughes will improve her practice, but so that physicians in general may recognize that patients deserve humanity and respect. In return, they will be rewarded with our business and our loyalty. When care and respect are absent, soon so will patients.",0.0,0.9993687272071838

Very unprofessional.  Never going back,  A doctor should never be rude with its patients.",0.0,0.973186731338501

I had been to other locations in previous years for the same problem. I was happy to discover this new location located less than a half mile from where I live. The waiting room was empty and my wait was only about 20 minutes. The examination took even less time. I was given an Rx for antibiotic, which cleared it up. I had just become eligible for Medicare and was told that I owed nothing on the day I visited. Today, almost 4 months later, I received a bill. FastMed had billed Medicare $295.00 for the visit, of which Medicare paid $156.31, leaving me a balance to pay of $138.69. This is more than I have paid in previous years when I had NO insurance! The $295.00 billing is outrageous! Next time I will make appointment with a regular doctor. By the way, the bill (the first I have received from them) also shows \""over 90 days\"" which will undoubtedly show up on my credit history. No thanks Fast Med. This is a rip off!",0.0,0.994176745414734

I scheduled an appointment and at my appointment I was told that I could not use the voucher for what I wanted. I was informed that it would be an additional $200 fee to see the Dr. PLUS an extra $90 or so each month. Basically, I was lied to. I followed all necessary steps in calling the location to have all my questions answered first and when I came in they tried to squeeze an extra $300+ out of me.

He may be a good surgeon (however I would not let him operate on me so I will never find out) but I have been to doctors that care about their patients, that don't interrupt their patients, and that have some empathy for their patients and that are reasonably punctual). Unfortunately, Dr. Baig during my office visits has exhibited none of these critical characteristics. I know there are much better choices out there unfortunately from Dr Baig's demeanor it is obvious that he doesn't know that.  His staff is nice, no issues.
