They do have lots of various prepackaged gift sets too. \n\n\""For the very best, look for the pineapple shape!\""  Indeed!   I love chocolate and my favorites are any of them dipped in milk or dark chocolate - you can't go wrong!   A little pricey for a small cookie, but you only live once right?!",1.0,0.9988945126533508

My half pound of container filled with poke came out to $7.77.  I got the creamy sauce with a hint of sriracha, green scallions and white onions.  I would like to try the shoyu and the garlic sauce next time.  \n\nAll the cakes look so delicious, but because I am on a healthy streak, I limited myself to two only.  I got the chantilly ($4) and guava cake ($3.75).  My bf, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, kept coming back for more bites while I was enjoying the chantilly cake.   It was a moist chocolate devil cake, with two layers of custard like frosting.  It has the perfect level of sweetness (not overly sweet).  Yum yum.\n\nThe guava cake was delish.  I had that the next day prior to hitting the gym, and the cake was still so moist.  It truly tastes like guava.  Gosh, I wanna head back for more, but I can only do so on a cheat day. \n\nThe owner is such a friendly and awesome person.  He gave me a guava malasada and that is such a nice gesture.  I totally did not expect that.  Also, it shows how detailed he is since that guava malasada choice must be due to my selection of the guava cake.  \n\nI can't wait to go back and try other tasty cakes and a different type of poke.  Yum Yum Yum.",1.0,0.9957148432731628
