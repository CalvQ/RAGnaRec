It came highly recommended by Yelpers and a personal friend who used to live nearby, so we were excited to check it out. Set in the Royal Palms, you walk through a lovely garden to get to the restaurant. It was raining the day we went, so we coudln't sit outside, but I'm sure it's beautiful.\n\nWe started with a couple glasses of wine, and the charcuterie plate. My bf loves cured meats, and we often order a similar appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants close to home. So we were terribly disappointed to be served a plate with only a couple slices of maybe 4 different meats, a small slice of pate, sliced pickles, a bit of mustard. That's it? For $13? The bread was served with some delicious pesto, but quite a bit of it, considering there were only 2 of us.\n\nFor entrees, bf ordered the seared scallops, and I had the short rib. His tasted fine to me, but I only had 1 bite. Halfway through the meal, he thought it smelled like BO, and couldn't finish it. Mine was ok, really nothing to write home about. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but we just were not impressed.\n\nService was great all the way through, thus the 3 stars. For me, the food wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular, as it should have been for the prices. Not sure what I was missing, but I just couldn't say this was a great experience.",1.0,0.8815516829490662

Loved the big fireplace and really appreciated the ambiance.  Classy and contemporary; not overly stuffy.\n\nThe bread basket was fantastic, especially the olive bread.  The salad I had -- I think it was the California? -- not so fantastic.  Very bland, and kind of limp greens; not fresh enough. I'm not sure if it was romaine or iceberg lettuce, but it wasn't very good. The lump meat crab cocktail was decent.\n\nMy dinner party shared several sides, the most notable being the scalloped potatoes and the creamed corn.  The tomatoes with spinach and cheese were not as good as I'd hoped ... heavy and, again, lacking in freshness.\n\nMy entree, the Dover Sole, was mediocre.  Not terrible, but not nearly as flavorful as I was hoping it would be, especially for the price. I almost never eat beef, but someone else in my party had the rib-eye steak, so I tried a bite and I have to say ... it was pretty incredible.  The portion sizes were ridiculously large.  Each entree could have easily been split among three people, they were such huge chunks of meat.\n\nFor dessert, our party of six split the brownie sundae and the deep-fried oreos.  The oreos were nothing like what I expected ... they tasted quite good, but I could only take one bite before feeling overwhelmed.  The sundae was nothing special.\n\nIt was a pleasant dining experience, and felt nice to indulge, but I was disappointed in many of the dishes we had.",0.0,0.885121762752533

It was quite interesting and a fun contrast to the spiciness of everything else. \n\nI ordered the dragonberry mojito. They have awards for their mojito's so I was expecting a lot.

We were greeted by a server that was QUITE enthusiastic almost to the point of annoyance, but hey he was friendly and attentive. \n\nWe looked over the menu and I suggested that we order every single item on it. I was reigned in and made to pick out 6 dishes. We ordered the: \n*Tortilla Espanola -amazing, I could have devoured the whole slice by myself. \n*Brussels sprouts- I didn't like them. For some reason the cook must have gone crazy with the lemon. We sent them back. \n*Chilled Asparagus w/Romanesco sauce- YUM! Big thick spears of asparagus covered with a creamy red sauce. \n*Gambas a la plancha- LARGE shrimp with a garlic aioli. The shrimp were tender and juicy. Fantastic. \n*Skirt steak ala plancha with romanesco sauce- tender, juicy nice char flavor and more of that glorious sauce. \n\nWe washed it all down with copious amounts of sangria and I was in heaven! \n\nI will CERTAINLY return to Sol y Sombra again!

Portions were mostly averaged sized, some much more generous than others. \n\nThe Meh: Like many tapas places, Julian Serrano can get really pricey if you're on the hungry side.
