It was a brand new, never worn Invicta, worth about only $200. But it was given to me by my uncle right before he passed away, so it has more sentimental value than monetary value. I just moved here to the Summerlin area not too long ago, so I figured that bringing it to the closest place that can give me a new battery would be a good idea. This place was also the location we purchased my dad's Father's Day gift and moms birthday gift from. They have nothing but Rolex, Breitling, Tacori and other high valued jewelry so one would assume they would know what they're doing. But as the phrase goes, \""never judge a book by its cover\""... When I first brought it in the lady at the counter said it would only take a couple of minutes, but then the repair technician said it would take about an hour because the back would not come off. So I left, called 3 hours later to make sure it was ready before I went over there, the lady who answered said it wouldn't be ready until tomorrow at the earliest, but we'll call you as soon as it's ready. No problem. So then tomorrow comes around, 2pm I just drive over there to pick up my watch whether it's done or not I intended on bringing it home with me. When I get the watch and am looking at it while the lady is ringing me up, first the wristband falls off, no big deal, easy fix, but then I notice a nice size scratch on the watch. I felt it with my finger and it's pretty deep. When I first mentioned it, the lady insisted that it was just the plastic. I inspected it and it was not the plastic. (Let alone, I own several Invicta watches and none have ever had plastic on this area.) I told her this definitely was not the plastic that was scratched. She took it back and had the technician look at it and he said it was the plastic, then with an attitude and confidently said \""like I told you, it's obviously the plastic, so is it ok to take the plastic off to show you?\""  I told her sure.... Minutes later she came back like a dog with its tail between its legs and said \""you're going to have to leave it overnight, it's a scratch\"". Told me to come back tomorrow and they'll have it ready, \""free of charge\"".  When I came back, of course they went against their word and wanted me to pay, which I did and decided it would be easier to pay the money then to have to deal with them any longer. If they can't properly service a $200 Invicta, I sure wouldn't trust them with my $7,000 Rolex I have from my grandfather.

Um, I didn't appreciate getting that lecture. I went to Macy's looking to buy a nice present for my husband - and I thought a watch would be perfect, and it looked stylish, too. So sue me! The watch works fine, and still works and even better than other watches we have here at home that are made by \""watch making\"" companies.\n\nAnd speaking of fine \""watch making\"" companies, I needed a new wristband for my Skagen watch. The watch was designed in a way to look stylish, but it actually was a design flaw that made a weak point for the writstband, which had worn through. I took it in to Dykman's to get a new writstband, and OK - I happen to love colors and because I love colors other than boring black or brown, I wanted a red wristband. Apparently, that was asking for too much and apparently to Dykman's, grownups don't wear colorful wristbands. My only choice was a black wristband - so a black wristband I got. I was told that was all Skagen had to offer as it had to be ordered from Skagen (that's how special the watch was), but I'm suspicious about that.\n\nThen, during the former occasion, I took in my \""Nine West\"" watch - the scandal of it all! This time, it wasn't a Skagen - so I knew I could safely ask for a red wristband. I did get a red wristband - but later, when I got some time to think about it and examine it more, I think I got a child's wristband. I mean really! Is it so hard to have a variety of adult wristbands to choose from? Is it too much to ask for something other than black, or brown?\n\nThe last straw was when I got a battery put in the Nine West watch after the above lecture on the inferior quality of timepieces made by companies that don't specialize in making watches and clocks - and suddenly, the battery didn't last very long at all. At first, I thought - darn fashion company for making an inferior watch - but then I went to get a new battery put in just to see and funny thing, it kept on ticking and still works to this day (although maybe there was a slight point in the lecture, as the hands are a little bit off, but it still works. I cannot even tell you where my Skagen watch is, as the stupid design flaw has rendered that watch unwearable and missing in action to this day.)",0.0,0.9981626868247986

Paul, the young man working there, is very knowledgable about watches and clearly knows his stuff, so I have nothing but praise for him in terms of knowledge.\n\nHowever, I was very disappointed that they could not do anything in the shop about a single one of my problems. Right away, I was told that the Skagen and the pocket watch had to be sent back to their makers for repair (even though I've been told that Dykman's is a Skagen-authorized repair shop). As for the Fossil with the battery, they kept it for a week, only to tell me when I came and got it that one of the screws was in too tight, and that it would have to be sent back to the maker as well! My frustration comes from feeling as though I had wasted my time in visiting a watch repair shop that, evidently, cannot repair watches even to the point of getting a stuck screw loose.

I dealt with an older gentleman (whom I had not dealt with previously) and on Staurday afternoon he took two of my watches (one needed to be cleaned and one needed the bracelet reattached), looked at them and said they would be ready on Tuesday. I was not able to make it back in until Wednesday afternoon but when I walked in the older lady who was out front looked around for a bit and then said they were not done. My annoyed blank stare must have prompted her to ask if I could come back later that afternoon. They took my number so a call would have been nice leeting me know they were not ready. Regardless, I came back three hours later to find that the one watch was cleaned but they were just begining to work on the other. I said that I could not wait around so I would take it back broken and pay for the cleaned one. While I am sure I was visibly annoyed, I said thank you, paid, said thank you again and walked toward the door. At this point the older lady made a comment under her breath. I turned around and said \""Excuse me?\"" she replied \""There goes a happy customer\"". I told her I was not happy and did not appreciate her comment.

They have been in the mall for 20+ years and for such a small operation, they knew their stuff. I was impressed that they knew about my watch and were quick to install the links for me so I could decide what size I wanted to wear it at. We adjusted the links a couple of times to get it right and they were very nice about it. Time was about 30 minutes total, which was fast compared to a couple of other watch places I visited prior to this one. I was surprised that they worked with Swiss watches but apparently they do movement repairs and everything. The price for my watch link adjustment + pins (I dented one, so he replaced it for FREE) was under $20.00 total. These people actually enjoy talking to their customers, which is nice because a lot of local watchmakers out here prefer you leave and come back later when it's ready. They are the polar opposite of that. Nice people, I'll give them my business before going to an independent place because they were efficient and friendly.

I would use the word \""lousy\"" except I'm trying not to use such a lousy word. :P\n\nSo here's my story.  I've been lazy in getting my watch batteries replaced, well, all of my watchs' batteries replaced.  I scooped up my 4 powerless watches, and headed to the nearest watch repair shop.  According to yelp and other searches, this was it.  I had no idea how much it costs to replace batteries in a watch ($30!!!), and instead of getting all 4 replaced at once, decided only to get my favorite two.  \n\nMy absolute favorite watch is a silicone Swatch watch in bands of blue.  It's from their line of super-thin watches and requires batteries that are similarly thinner than normal.  The other watch, a silver Kenneth Cole, quickly had its batteries taken out and just as rapidly replaced and set.  The Swatch however, ran into issues.  The battery was easily gotten out, and employee #1 selected a battery to replace it.  But because of the width of the replacement battery, the cover wouldn't close right.  I bit my tongue because well... these people were supposed to know what they were doing.  \n\nThere were 3 employees there, and they all took turn pushing, prodding, and even at times pounding at the watch to try to get that battery to fit.  10 minutes into it, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to go walk around the rest of the mall for a while.  When I came back, both watches were presented to me and I was told that \""they work\"".  I believed them.  \n\nI was really used to not wearing watches, so it took me a couple of days to notice that my Swatch never showed any time besides 4:32.  I sighed and resigned myself to going back to see if there was anyway to fix it or get my money back.  At the store there were 3 employees, 1 of which was the main guy working on the watch the last time.  Another guy, I believe his boss, quickly took over the watch, remarked, wow, it doesn't work.  Right.  /sigh/  He went through a few of the battery drawers, looking for a battery they don't carry.  \n\nAfter I had been there for 20 minutes or so, I gingerly asked if I could get a refund.  No was the immediate reply, and I was directed to look at their no-refund policy next to the door.  Normally, I appreciate and respect policies that stores hold.  However, as I was absolutely assured that the watch works when I walked out of the door the first time, I didn't consider this a valid policy in this case.  I felt cheated, lied to, and incredibly pissed off.  There were so many moments between these two times where I just wanted to grab my watch back from their seemingly clumsy hands.  \n\nI stormed out of there.  The end.  I was offered store credit, but what the heck would I do with it?  Burn it, torch it, incinerate it whichever way I can???",0.0,0.9996473789215088

The man working there told me it would cost 10 dollars for a new battery but the rubber gasket which makes the watch water resistant would need to be replaced as well and that would cost another 7 dollars.  I agreed to the extra charge and left the watch with them.  While I was walking through the mall, I happened to realize there was a Fossil store there.  I walked into browse a little.  A very nice employee asked if I needed anything, I was just curious...so I asked if they replaced batteries for their watches there.  He said yes and told me it would be 8 or 9 dollars depending on the model and type of battery.\n\nI immediately realized I had been ripped off by Fast Fix but wasn't too upset because I figured it was my fault for not researching the Fossil store from the beginning.  Yet, when I returned to Fast Fix to pick up my watch, they still weren't done with it...I had been gone for over an hour.  After standing there for 5 minutes, the male employee loudly smashed the back cover back on and handed it to a female employee who looked it over and smashed it again for good measure(?).\n\nI reluctantly paid for the new battery and was about to put the watch on when I noticed a medium size scuff on the face of the watch and dozens of tiny scratches in the back cover.  This really made me upset and I mentioned it.  My comments were met with annoyed silence...to which I pointed out that they had over charged me, citing the price given to me by the Fossil store.  The male employee stood up and yelled at me for 5 minutes about while their prices might be higher - it is because they take greater care of the watches and use higher quality batteries...he also strangely added that he takes \""all the liability and risk\"" of damage which also increases his costs.  I pointed out that they had - in fact - damaged my watch but made no offer to compensate me for the damage.  He told me I should have thought about that before I came in the store and pointed to the \""No Refunds\"" sign.\n\nI told him to have a nice day and walked out - only to look at the watch and realize they hadn't even done me the favor of resetting the watch to the correct date and time.

They work great for me as a work watch, however the bezels keep coming off. The bezel came off my first one, so my wife bought me another watch. The bezel came off of that one too. I called the company that handles their watches and they sent me a bezel for ten bucks. I could not get it to stay on, so my wife took them into the store and they advised her to send them into their watch repair company (GENEVAWATCHGROUP), so we did. We also paid for shipping and parts another $46.39, now $56.39 (more than half of what one watch cost, but as I found a few months ago in Big 5 sporting goods on sale for less than the cost of repairs $49.00). I couldn't bring myself to by another, even at half price. Two weeks later we got them back and one by one the bezel came off again. So my wife bought me another Tommy Bahama watch, this time a more expensive one (really Babe, I love but). So now I call the store ahead of time to tell them my situation. They asked me to bring the watches down to the store (36 miles round trip). I wanted to get my money back on the two that keep losing the bezel, but I didn't have my receipt for either. However, I did have the receipt for the more expensive one that my wife recently got me, so according to the receipt if you wanted to return the item, you could as long as you have the receipt. I then asked for my money back for the one on my wrist because I did not like it (I only had one box and it would not hold more than two watches, so I had it on my wrist). When I did the salesperson asked why I was wearing it if I did not like it and how many times have I worn it. Really lady, the receipt did not mention anything about how many times I have worn it and it made me unconfortalbe to say that I only wore it to make my wife feel good.

Ask the full price stores themselves if you don't believe me.\n\nAnyways, that being said, Fossil employees are alot more knowledgeable about the warranty details of YOUR WATCH from Michael Kors or Armani than the original retailer themselves.

The man behind the counter said it was fine and I would be able to collect my watch in some minutes with the new battery. \n\nOn retrieving my watch the man insisted on placing it on my wrist for me and although I thought this a bit odd I was okay with it as I would inspect the backing once I left the store.

The man insisted it was the fault of the manufacturer, that it was a cheap plastic watch anyway, that my battery was replaced as I asked and he could have done no better a job (I've no doubt of the last statement!). After pointlessly pushing my case that had brought in a complete watch and left with a broken one, which I would have happily taken somewhere else if there had been any indication from himself that he was struggling with getting the backing off (but there wasn't), and that I had every right to be upset, particularly given that he tried to deceive me by placing the watch on my wrist so  that I might not notice his savagery, (which he in no way denied and it was obvious from his speech and manner that he knew he had damaged my property), another man working there said they would be willing to refund the cost of the battery. Well, better than nothing but the cost of the repair would be better!  \n\nAs it was clear this was the best I was going to get from this simpleminded lot and that further efforts would be better spent hitting my head off of a brick wall, I was 'kindly' asked once and again and again to leave. At no point did I raise my voice beyond a reasonable level or curse or dance around like a maniac but I certainly felt justly angered for this treatment, expressed myself calmly and coherently and was met with idiocy and false truths. \n\nNeedless to say I would not shop at Poundsavers if it was the only show in town after the brutality my watch endured and the treatment I subsequently received today.

I had to have both of these parts replaced which ended up costing hundreds further (sapphire crystals are expensive).  The date, which is supposed to click over within a few minutes of midnight per specifications was clicking over 20 minutes early.  To quote the second horologist, that indicates sloppy workmanship in replacing the hands after removal.\n\nIt ended up costing me around $800 in parts and labor to have the watch properly serviced and Dave's and company's mistakes cleaned up.

Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. \nI started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \"" missing manual or dead battery\"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. \nI was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. \nI asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. \nI get \""as is\"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.\nNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. \nThank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.\n\nPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad",0.0,0.999321222305298
