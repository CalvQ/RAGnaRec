Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!\n\nOf course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?\n\nthe CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.\n\nOn to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep. \n\nGreat atmosphere, great employees, great food.\n\nOh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.",1.0,0.5732595920562744

Asked for a refill on iced tea. 10 minutes later had to ask for iced tea again.\n\nVery disappointed that this place has declined so noticeably. Hate to say it, but this was our last visit.

Wow, were we surprised at out visit.  We have eaten there before and were not disappointed, but this time was not a treat.  We arrived at 6:30 and they were about half full.  We thought they would be packed for a Saturday night.  The music that was playing was so loud that it made you flinch.  We sat at a 2 top and had to yell across the table the entire time.  Not fun.  When our server did finally arrive, she was pleasant.  However, she could not answers our questions and had to keep going to the kitchen for information.  I am not talking about crazy questions either, I just wanted to know if their green tea had caffeine or not.  \n\nWe eat sushi often so we are always eager to try something new.  We ordered 4 items.  The first one we received was something we didn't order.  We didn't realize it until the correct one came next.  No worries, not a big deal.  Every plate was brought to us by a different person, which I appreciate the teamwork and making sure our food gets to us freshly made.  The sushi was warm, room temp at best.  The flavors were bland, even the on with jalapenos in it.  \n\nWe couldn't even tell anyone that we were not please with our food because no on came back to check on us.  When our server finally did come back to drop the check, she asked us how everything was and we told her it was not delicious and we would have rather told her that 30 minutes earlier but she was MIA.  She looked embarrassed and offered us a dessert.  I told her that if we didn't like the dinner, why would we even want to try a dessert.  She spun around, flipped her long hair and walked off into the sunset.\n\nThere are far too many great local restaurants to eat at and support to waste your time and money on mediocre.

He took our drink orders, delivered them and then took our food orders. \nI ordered the chicken mushu and my friend ordered the Jean's Long Life Noodles. The food came out and while I was mixing my food together I saw a piece of plastic in my food. Most people would complain about it and send it back but I already knew our waiter could have cared less so I just decided not to eat anymore and pick off my friends dish (which was tasty by the way). Our waiter never came by to see how our food was (no surprise there) and never offered us a dessert menu, he just came by and dropped off the check. \nThe funny part of this story is, when he saw me pull out a bunch of $100 bills he suddenly became extremely friendly towards us. I left a small tip for him (I used to work for tips as a blackjack dealer, so I sometimes feel guilty when I don't leave anything).

WAnted to go someplace nice but not over the top. \n\nMade reservations for 9 on a Saturday night. Arrived to a small line. Told her about our reservation. She robotically told us to go to the other line. Once I was in the fro.nt of the second line, another hostess gave me one of those square light filled waiting thing. Felt kinda like chili's. All hostesses seemed overworked and none really smiled. It seemed they were all overwhelmed students doing this for the first time.  eventually a hostess led us to our table. Asked her how her day went and she said it was busy. I thought to myself, but it's sat in Vegas. Is this something new?\n\nUpon entering, you see well decorated interior. Everything in the place screams Paris sophistication. Dimly lit amber chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings. Decorative windows w colored cutouts. Marble tables. The place looks like a million bucks. Decor is a comfortable elegance. Everything is beautiful yet approachable. Perfect for a romantic dinner.\n\nI ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes au gratin and sting beans. CJ ordered the seafood platter. A combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. Food came relatively quickly. Was all as expected. Taste was ok. 3/5. Which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. Platter was also $24/person minimum 2. Considering, it was very little food for the price. Was more ice than anything else.\n\nWait staff was also peculiar. Waiter walks by. Makes eye contact. Then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. Now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said \""I'll be right back\"", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  He was cordial and informative though. Food as said came out as ordered. But minutes later he is refilling our water. After a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. Overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. This place has one of the best locations across from the Bellagio fountains.\n\nOverall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant.

When we arrived, we were early, so the hostess suggested that we sit at the bar until our table was ready.  We sat in the lounge area and ordered drinks.  Shortly after, our table was ready, so we asked the hostess to tell the bartender/server that we had been shown to our table and to please bring the drinks when they were ready.  After being shown to our table, we waited for about 15 minutes before the bartender brought our drinks and said she had been looking for us since she had no idea where we had gone.  Turns out, the hostess never passed our message along.  Very poor communication in a restaurant that should pride itself on great food AND service.  Moving on, it took some time for our waiter to finally address us, but when he did, he was very nice.  I had already decided that I was going to get their Seabass, and my mom was going to order the Filet Mignon.  When we go to order, our waiter informs us that they're out of BOTH of our selections.  Wait, so this is a steakhouse, and you're out of the Filet Mignon at 8pm????  And the Seabass???  Very very disappointing, but what can we do at this point?  So, we order and ask for some of their bread, which looked so delicious from the pictures that other Yelpers had posted.  He brings us out two orders because, guess what, they're about to run out and he wants to make sure we have enough.  Very sweet and thoughtful gesture, but you're going to run out of BREAD?  What is going on here?  My mom and husband shared the 40 oz. Ultimate Steak, which I thought was a good value.  But, the steak wasn't very impressive.  I got the Salmon, and didn't even finish half because it was just....eh.  And, the waiter had no idea how I felt about the meal because he didn't check on us.  The favorite part of the meal were the sides of the Mashed Potatoes (YUM!), Macaroni & Cheese, and our drinks, which were very creative and tasty.  Service was just okay...it took a while to have plates cleared and we were never checked on, despite the fact that there were multiple managers walking around who passed our table plenty of times.  I understand that running out of food wasn't our waiters fault, but then he didn't even offer a complimentary dessert or anything, which again, just seemed a bit odd for a nice restaurant.  Having been so excited to dine here, I was very disappointed when we left.  My family always lets me pick restaurants because I love yelping and reading other reviews, but this time, I was completely let down.  Maybe it was an off night, but unfortunately, I'll never return (and, we go to Vegas quite often...actually going in 5 more days).",0.0,0.9897401332855223

A hostess then escorted us out of the Mansion into the MGM and through the casino the the entrance of the restaurant.  \n\nWe were seated at a table for two across from each other such that polite conversation was not possible without some sort of public address system.

As we were deciding what we wanted, one of the waitstaff arrived with the bread cart and began explaining the options right over my partner and I both being otherwise occupied  looking at and discussing the wine list.  She did not leave.  She did not pardon the interruption.  She just stood there talking and pointing to the bread.  \n\nThere were many courses.  It was all quite interesting and appetizing in the descriptions.  When they showed up, most of them did not please the palate.  I won't go into a description of each course and my thoughts because food is very subjective and much a matter of taste, but I will say I was disappointed in all but the braised veal cheeks, they were incredible and I highly recommend them.  \n\nEven after multiple courses and many items on carts to choose from, I enjoyed a few things, but was just not impressed overall.",0.0,0.9699469208717346

Both my friend and I thought this would be one of our highlights!\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. My friend has a few food allergies. Their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. She didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. Things that have been easily done by Red Robin and other chains. Easy stuff. They called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.She was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. Great!\n\nWe get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. He went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. Despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone. \n\nWe split the raw yellowtail app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. It was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! There was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. They also messed that up but fixed it. My friend had the black cod and I had the short rib angolotti. The cod was again a very small portion. The angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. It was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for Vegas.\n\nI had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. I watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. Luckily he did not. My annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so I decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.\n\nMy friend and I have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. This was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. The food was ok. Maybe it was an off night, who knows.

She looks up... no smile.  We're told the wait is about 15 minutes, and we reply it's not a problem, asking if it's ok to sit at one of the many empty seats/booths across the bar near the entrance.  She pauses before answering that it's ok (and only later do I sense that her response was a bit cold).\n\nHowever, I'm still in high spirits from having arrived in Vegas that evening for extended weekend of friends and partying.  As we're led into the dining room, I marvel at the coziness.  The room is quite small, with what seemed like 3 rows of tables, with the window seats overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  It's more intimate than I expected, and I immediately filed the memory as a good place to bring a date.\n\nWe're led to a circular, chic booth that had, in hindsight, almost a diner-like feel to it... but it was an upscale setting, and was something I actually enjoyed so we could eat family style.\n\nWe had chosen to dine here because Arvin T had heard they had an amazing spaghetti.  But let's continue chronologically.  The bread basket came out, and it was amazing.  The stromboli was tasty, though I'm no expert, and we ended up asking them for a second basket.  The waiter was slow in bringing that second basket out, and I definitely felt like we committed a taboo... but that didn't stop us from reminding him to bring that out for us.\n\nI'd go down a play-by-play for each of the items on the menu, but, to be honest, it wasn't very impressive.  I really hoped the food was so good that I could look past the mediocre service, which bordered on indifferent.  But, alas, it cannot be said.\n\nI would still recommend this place to bring your date for a nice, intimate dinner.  The dim yellow lighting exuded a warmth that I only wished was completed by quality service I had come to expect from the Cosmo...  If service isn't important to you, esp in relation to money spent, then I would still suggest giving this place a go sometime.\n\nHowever, I think of Vegas as a place to escape - a sanctuary away from the hustles of life.  Scarpetta let me down, and it was only the first punch in the stomach by Cosmo that night.",1.0,0.9807164072990416

All I was thinking was \""WOW\"". Look, I GOTTA testify, their food is good enough to treat people like dirt and still succeed - the fact that they care so much makes it a NO-BRAINER. I've  trained Customer Service for a living for over 26 years, I know what I'm looking at -  Thank you, Shannon, thank you, Rise And Shine!",1.0,0.99624902009964

They wanted help consuming food to fulfill their $20 credit for this particular casino restaurant, so being a nice guy, I agreed.\n\nServer was nice and friendly. Probably the most positive part of the experience. No cleanliness issues or anything, and ambient music isn't too loud at all.\n\nIt felt like my friend's coffee took at least 5 minutes to arrive. I'm pretty sure service at the buffet would have been faster. Whether the server is being stretched or is just slow, don't expect a super fast meal here.\n\nFirst food to come out was the shrimp cocktail, my friend's order. Let's just say I've seen better. Nothing all that wrong with the flavor, but the shrimp were definitely on the soft side. Also, they were small. Not the miniature size that you'll sometimes find in, say, a package of dried shrimp, but pretty dang small and unappealing.\n\nThe other two items arrived simultaneously. My order was the honey bbq boneless chicken wings, which I'll fully admit was a questionable call. However, I was anticipating more than heavily battered school cafeteria-quality meat doused in a ridiculous amount of mystery sauce. Guess I was wrong on that. At least there were some carrots and celery for me to dip in ranch and make myself feel a little bit better about the whole thing.\n\nMy friend's other order was the fish and chips. The fish were not too bad actually, with four huge fluffy pieces and a reasonable batter. My issue here was with the lackluster shoestring fries. I've had better from pretty much every fast food chain that I've tried. There was some crispiness, but there was little flavor and no imagination.\n\nPer my review of my last visit here, the food and service time was not good and I was only keeping the rating up for some arcane reasons that I won't fall back on now. Even the 24/7 hours don't matter to me because I would rather take a few extra minutes to go to another always-open place in Henderson by the name of Henry's American Grill.",0.0,0.9928717017173768

Frankly, given they were new to downtown Phoenix at the time and just beginning to build a clientele, so I was a bit surprised they turned away a party of about ten people.  No worries--we found another local place perfectly willing to accommodate us.\n\nMy more recent visit was just a couple of days ago; a party of two in the afternoon hours.  At first, the server seamed quick and attentive, but after serving drinks and entrees, disappeared.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after finishing our meals to get a carryout container, then she never brought the check.  So much for the service.\n\nThe food was mediocre.  I say that because my friend enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, my I didn't care for the Danny Boy's Shepherd's Pie at all.  The mashed potatoes had the texture of cardboard and the mystery meat had no flavor of beef.  I guess the two meals averaged out to \""mediocre.\""  Of course, the absentee server might have known that if she bothered to check back with us.\n\nI don't ask for much --- I really don't.  I never send my food back, but is dropping $50 on two entrees and two drinks in exchange for discernible food and a server who doesn't forget you exists too much to ask for?  :::Sigh::: \n\nOh, and I like to be able to hear the game on tv as much as anyone else, but PLEASE turn it down a notch so I can hear the person sitting two feet away from me speak.",0.0,0.9986531734466552

After our drink orders were taken, everything went downhill after that. They were not busy and we were one of 4 tables outside and there were 3 servers on duty along with a bartender and manager.  \n\nOur server only refilled our drinks unless I tracked her down or asked another server to go and grab her.  I did this three times. Our food took about 45 minutes to come out and not once did our server give us an update on our orders. I had to go into the restaurant and ask her what the status of our orders were and again ask her to refill our drinks.\n\nBy the time our food came out, we were just wanting to eat, pay and leave.   Two of my friends ordered the Bagels with Salmon.  Both came out with no cream cheese. My other friend ordered eggs over easy and bacon and the eggs were over cooked.  The server did not ask us how our food was nor did we see her again until it came time for the check.\n\nWhen it came time for the check, I was charged for a Bloody Mary. I did not order a Bloody Mary.  I will never go back to that place again.",0.0,0.9975267052650452

I'm certainly willing to give them another try, but here is what I experienced on my visit. \n\nOn first impression, I love the d\u00e9cor and feel of the restaurant. They got that 100% right. However, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on...that night (Wednesday) it wasn't very busy so there was no hustle/bustle to give the place a warm vibe or maybe it was the sound system and how the music didn't really fill the room.  Not sure, but it felt like we were the last table in a restaurant that was about the close for the night. Just a little too quite.\n\nI'd actually give the food 3/4 stars. It was decent. I think my favorite was the crispy gnocchi and would love to see that as a meal...it was darn good. \n\nWhere the night went wrong was partly due to the staff.  It wasn't that they were not friendly, they were, just inexperienced and their \""professionalism\"" seemed forced, which if they are new to serving tables I understand it takes time to get your mo-jo going. Our appetizers came out on time and when I asked the person who delivered them (not our server) what type of bread came with the spinach and crab dip, as there were two different types served, his answer was, \""I don't know. I can ask the chef if you want\"".  I feel like if you work at a restaurant and you are one of the people that brings food to the table, you should be well aware of the menu and what is on it. Maybe it was his first night on the job...who knows. At least he offered to ask the chef, I guess. \n\nAfter the appetizers my soup came out and then shortly after he said our entrees would be out shortly.  They then delivered one entr\u00e9e followed by about a 10 minute wait...there was four of us in the party, so we were waiting on 3 more entrees.  They then delivered one more entr\u00e9e, still nothing on the other two, just apologies for the wait.  I even asked the waiter what was the hold up on the entrees, to which he answered \""I'm not sure, let me ask them\"".  Hummm...we've been waiting now for 15 minutes + just to get out entrees served and you are apologizing, but you don't know why you are apologizing. When our entrees finally did come out the manager (I assume) finally gave us the reason...our steaks had been over cooked and they had to redo them.  Which, if they would have told us that right from the get go then I would have been understanding to the wait.  Also, while we were waiting during all of this the manager brought out a free appetizer, the spinach and crab dip, which we had already had.  It was a nice gesture, but also shows that there was no communication between the server and manager.  Why bring a table something they've already tried? Why not ask us what we would prefer considering we were the ones inconvenienced. \n\nI hope it does improve and will go back another time over a weekend, perhaps to see if I can have a better experience.",0.0,0.9881238341331482

Here's a few comments to help you decide whether or not to do it:\n\nBooking was easy on their website.\n\nMeet up location was not inside as stated on the instructions after booking.  Instead, we met outside in the freezing cold (Vegas is in the 30's/40's right now) with the wind blowing hard.  Disappointing.  Then, the guide started the tour by giving us some history/trivia about Vegas (very cool) but he did it in our outdoor meeting area which was right under a blaring speaker of music that is piped in the outdoor area.  Hard to hear him.  10 steps away was a quiet serene place that he could've done this.\n\nTour guide Joel is awesome - very knowledgeable, doesn't go too fast, cares about the group's experience.\n\nWe visited 5 locations and it took 2.5 hours to do so.  That's fine, because nothing dragged on.  The problem is that I was told on the phone and by email that the tour would start at 3p and end at 430p.  I was upset that we were just barely getting to our 5th restaurant at 510pm.  We had somewhere to be at 530pm so we had to leave the tour early (we tasted the food there first though).\n\nOk - now to the food.  AMAZING, except for our last stop.  All stops had plentiful tasting portions and by the end we were full - a perfect early dinner!  The first 4 stops were absolutely delicious, and fun too.  The manager/host at each restaurant was clearly proud of their work and happy to share info with us about what we were eating, how it's made, etc.  The 5th/last stop was pizza - and it was gross.  Yuck.  My husband and I agree it was the greasiest pizza we had ever eaten....the crust was soaked in it it was that bad.  Yuck again.  Shocking that this stop was included because the first 4 stops were outstanding, using high quality ingredients and techniques.  Yuck on the pizza.  Ok - I think I've got that out of my system now.\n\nOverall - we'd happily sign up for this tour again the next time we're in Vegas....even if it means hearing the same spiel from each restaurant manager and tasting the same food because it was that good.  Oh - except for the pizza....we'd skip the last stop.  And now that we know the tour will last until 530p and it meets outside, we would be better prepared.",1.0,0.754807710647583

My husband and I have been to Cuff together, with friends and with workmates no less than a dozen times.  While the food is great, the menu is small and the service (outside)sub-par at best.  Every time we've been, yes, all dozen+ times, we've had to ask more than once for water for the table. We love eating outdoors but the service is terrible and then the constant clatter and interruption of dirty-dishes traffic to the building in the back makes it impossible to dine in peace.  We were there with a group and waited forever for our drinks, food and then sadly, the filet-mignon was all terribly over-cooked.  (Think cremated)Unfortunately we don't think Cuff can manage a full house, hence, they will be their own worst enemy if there is a crowd. Fingers crossed they can work out these kinks as we are trying hard to help this place.  BTW...I tried three times today in person and by phone to obtain gift cards totaling $500.00+ and  no one could help me or bothered to call me back. Ended up getting them from La Santisima who was all too happy to accept my money.\nBest of luck, Cuff.",0.0,0.9983521699905396
