I went to Heng Hong because a buddy of mine said he was the best in town, and he was 100% right. Heng is an expert at his craft and his prices are great. I told him I needed my coat done asap and I picked it up 48 hours later. He is a funny guy and he does excellent work on everything I bring in.

Because the reviews for nearby Fifth Ave Alterations suggested that suit jacket tailoring was around $20, I took my two jackets to them. Before leaving, I asked about the cost and was told that the boss would call me with an estimate. The next day, someone at Fifth Ave Alterations called to tell me it would be $32 (cash only) for two suit jackets that just needed sleeves to be tightened and shortened. Those jackets came out just fine. \n\nA few days later, I ended up finding another suit jacket with longer sleeves and decided to give Zizzo a try. The customer service at Zizzo (Phil?) was awesome. He knew I had limited experience with tailoring (as did Fifth Ave Alterations), determined that I needed the sleeves shortened, and told me to return next Wednesday. No confirmation slip or price estimate, but to be fair, I didn't ask for either.\n\nWhen I returned, he didn't remember me and of course, I had no confirmation slip. I suppose he's just so friendly that he usually remembers everyone. Luckily I only had the one jacket and was able to point it out -- after he asked me if it was some other jacket and almost gave me someone else's item. The total was $28 (credit accepted) for shortening the sleeves on one suit jacket. So double the cost of Fifth Ave Alterations for essentially the same thing (shortening sleeves). \n\nIn short, great customer service at Zizzo, with the exception of almost being given the wrong item at pickup. And perhaps I'm missing something about the quality of tailoring at Zizzo, but compared to Fifth Ave Alterations, all jackets seemed to come out fine. Because of the double price difference, I'm likely to stick with Fifth Ave Alterations in the future.",1.0,0.8278807997703552

Shame then that I'm rubbish at it.\n\nThe second time I went in was to add a button and a button hole onto a shirt which tended to flap up annoyingly quite a lot. The button was taken from the shirt (so I imagine that reduced the cost slightly) but the hole was made and stitched so that it looks no different to the others. The price for this service which has bought renewed life to a shirt I no longer wore? Three pounds. You absolutely cannot argue with prices like that; I would've happily paid seven pounds for the same and I really respect the fact that they charge for the amount of work they complete and not just what they think they can get away with.\n\nIn terms of time for completion for both items, I believe I had to wait a couple of days but I wasn't really in a rush for either so didn't push for them to be completed any quicker - I do get the impression though that if I'd have been desperate they could have made the alterations quicker, although I imagine there would have been some extra cost attached. \n\nSo why only four stars? Well the new lining in the hems of my trousers only seems to be properly sewed on one side meaning I get my foot caught in it when I put my trousers on. That may sound like an odd reason to detract a star but it's small quality issues like these that stop it from being a perfect service and just keep it as a very good one.\n\nI have absolutely no hesitation in going back to Stitch Express and fully intend to use them for any other alteration/repair work needed on my wardrobe.

I can say that after my first experience though, I thought I was being overcharged. But after receiving the shirt back, the cut was perfect and nicely fitted. She explains everything and will try to keep costs low. I've since taken several pieces of clothing back and its always perfect every time. I've had everything done from pants hemmed, to fitting my dress shirts, to fitting my pea coat and even a suit done. \n\nTailoring a suit isn't cheap. Since I lost a little weight, I needed it to go down a full size. It cost $120, but after experiencing a good fit, there isn't a comparison. Nothing feels and looks better than a well cut suit. A good tailor is hard to find, similar to a good mechanic. Prices here aren't the cheapest, but they seem to be average. Regardless, she provides good service and great quality work so I don't mind spending the extra buck.",1.0,0.9966149926185608

Pasquale is an artist, offering bespoke suits, shirts and jackets, as well complete tailoring of off the rack items.  His knowledge of constructing a suit from scratch allows him to alter a suit's chest, waist, jacket length, shoulders, lapel, etc. - services I have not found elsewhere.  He has an artists eye and will tailor your clothes to fit your entire body, not just sleeve and pant length.  Pasquale does the fitting and tailoring himself, so you are assured of quality throughout the process.\n\nThe emphasis is on quality craftsmanship, so some patience helps, though Pasquale often helps those who have an emergency and need something done in short order.  The atmosphere of the shop is casual and friendly.  The prices are a bit more than some other shops, but considering the quality of the work and the hours of craftsmanship involved, they are really dirt cheap.\n\nIf you have never had a suit (or other item) expertly tailored, I highly recommend bringing something to Pasquale.

After finally getting fed up with hemming (if you can call it that) my own pants, and then tripping when my heels get caught in my bad hem job, I decided that I make a decent enough living and can afford to pay a tailor to do it right.\n\nWasn't sure where to go, so my first thought was Delia's Cleaners, since they have a sign that says they do alterations. While I do make a decent living, I do a lot of second-hand-clothes shopping, so I was not about to pay $12 to hem some pants that cost me $8.00. And then I read some reviews about this and the reviews didn't inspire much confidence in the quality of the service I'd be getting for that.\n\nAs I drove out of the Safeway shopping plaza where Delia's is located, I noticed a small \""alterations\"" place across the street: A Stitch in Time. Coincidence? I think not. Fate is more like it.\n\nAnd \""fate\"" is part of her name: FATEMEH! She is awesome! I walked in there with a large bag full of all the pants I ever hemmed badly or rolled up. At least 8 pants on that first visit. \n\nFatemeh had me try each one on, and she quickly put some pins into one leg of each pair of pants. She asked me when I needed them back, and when I said by this time next week (expecting her to say no way, or that 'll cost ya) she said OK! Not a problem. \n\nI was worried because I didn't even check for references or anything and had just driven up there. So this was a big leap of faith with almost all the pants I own. \n\nI was THRILLED when I got them back. Every single one of them was a perfect fit, and the stitching was excellent. Not only that, she ironed all of them! Those poor pants hadn't had face-time with a good pressing in a looong time! \n\nWhat's more, Fatemeh was so grateful for the business. She thanked me an awkward number of times during the 5 or 6 minutes I was there to pick up my items. I thought it was maybe because there were so many and it was a big bill, but she was just the same with the other people who were there as well. I say it was awkward because I rarely encounter a business owner who THANKS customers or clients, as most people act so entitled or like you owe them something. It was refreshing. She just genuinely appreciates her clients. \n\nWell Fatemeh, this client genuinely appreciates you, too. I appreciate her so much I have been a repeat customer at least 6 more times in the past 8 months.",1.0,0.9901356101036072

I'm not talking about the prices!  Forget the fact that a suit is $5 and they do it onsite!  I am a magician and have some tough suits to clean with special pockets and all sorts of stuff.  The real problem is that my suits are made of shiny material with a really tight special weave.  Stains are hard to get off.  The first time I went in they didn't notice there were a few stains that stayed on (you have to look at them in the light at an angle anyway to see through the shine of the suit sometimes.)  They happily and gladly redid it twice, until the spots were all off!  When it came time to pay (The stains and suit are my fault not theirs) they asked for $5.  I thought they were joking!

Dont be turned away by Phil's sarcasm and perceived lack of caring - it is a ruse that creates a special bond between him and his fellowship.
