She had me convinced I needed to see her 3 to 4 times a week for 6 months. Luckily, I worked at a hospital and a good friend of mine is a neurosurgeon, he laughed hysterically after looking at my x-rays and told me she was scamming me and there was nothing wrong with my back by just looking at my bones. He would need an MRI to actually know what was wrong.\n\nHer office is beautiful and it's a great location but parking is terrible.

Don't worry if you don't or can't fall asleep since she will check on you to see if you're comfortable.  You can meditate or zone out but most people power nap.

(have used acupuncture since 1982 for various health problems in different parts of the world when I was not helped by orthodox medicine or when the medications had severe side effects) \nFor most of the last year I have been receiving treatment from Dr. Ran and it has made a great difference. My back used to go into spasm while I was driving even for a short distance. That got better after the first time. The rest of my back is in pretty bad shape but her treatment means I am able to do most normal things and even at my age 69 I feel I am constantly improving.\nThe needles are so very fine they honestly don't really hurt, maybe just a tiny sting - gone as soon as it is felt It is not anything like having an hypodermic injection. Dr. Ran places leads on the needles which gently vibrates them so the result goes deeper and is more lasting. She is very careful and asks all the time if what she is doing is comfortable for you and will stop when ever you want her too.\nI have seen many very  good acupuncturists all over the world but none as good and genuine and as caring as Dr.Ran..
