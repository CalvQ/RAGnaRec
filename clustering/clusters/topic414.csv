After they removed our old carpet they told us it was going to cost another $180 dollars to glue down some tacking strips.

If you have a house like mine and you need couple of tiny rooms cleaned they charge you the full price of a room.  I spoke with 2 different people and neither one cared to hear the square footage.  I have 500 square feet in 3 areas- 300 sq feet-125 sq feet -75 sq feet.  Even though they'll do 600 sq feet for the price of 3 rooms if one of those rooms is larger than 200 sq feet than they charge you AN ENTIRE ROOM for the extra area.  Even though one room is tiny.\n\nI understand this is common with carpet cleaning and companies will say it's to keep a structured plan- or to have the same rules for each house-or some other excuse.  The truth is it helps them charge more.  If they charged per square foot they would make less money.  Epic Carpet is not different from any other carpet company and I will not use them until they have fair pricing system.\n\n\n11/2/13**After writing this review the owner called and said he was sorry for the answering service he was using.
