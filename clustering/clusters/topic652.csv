I got friends visiting in town from Cali. We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme \u00c7a, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CR\u00c8ME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \"" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\"" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn't enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager. I will keep my business in Comme \u00c7a, Mon Ami Gobi and Bouchon and never come back again.",0.0,0.995005190372467

Got there around 915pm with our group of 5.  Seated immediately and were greeted by our service staff.  Wine (red or white) is AWFUL like horrible cheap in a box but worse stuff.  Still, due to someone daring someone else to drink we killed 2 carafes of white and 1/2 of red.  Blech....still tasted bad and it didn't get any better!\n\nAmbiance was OK, not super 'old school Vegas' as others would recommend; however, the wait staff was pleasant and not in a hurry to shuffle us out the door at 10pm when they closed.\n\nThe first course included soup or salad, and we mostly got the salad - mixed greens from the bag at the grocery store, complete with bottled dressing and crappy bread.\n\nFood included spag with meat sauce (extra sauce requested and it came on the side, a-plenty), Aurora sauce (not the best, not the worse), Filet of something that basically was Fajitas minus the Tortillas and the fish stew, which had two small halves of tough, chewy crab, shrimp that was equally unappetizing and overcooked, perhaps purchased in bulk at Sam's Club,  \n\nSeriously, the ONE saving grace was the cappuccino - homemade and amazingly wonderful - honestly, the best ever.\n\nSo, if you're looking to spend a few $$ for a great after dinner drink come here.  Otherwise, skip it.  Wish someone would have warned us more sternly!\n\nI've attached pics so you can see the seriously average food.",0.0,0.9607236981391908

It will give you the blues!   Went to HOB for dinner as I was craving their new Citrus Steak Salad - which I've had twice before.  It usually on point, delicious and unforgettable.  However I was very very disappointed tonight.  The salad did not have the same flavor as it used to - it was missing the hint of ginger and heat of jalapenos.  It tasted like a plain old forgettable chopped salad with a tasteless vinegarette dressing.  I mentioned it to the waiter - who didn't really seem to care - but offered to have them redo it and add some seasoning to it - I told him what flavors were missing....He brought it out after they remade it - it tasted the same....bland.....A manager came over and I told him that  I came specifically for this salad as I've had it twice before....and he explained that they took out the ginger and jalapenos because customers were complaining.....totally did not make sense to me as it is on the menu (which was created by chef Aaron Sanchez) He offered to bring me some chopped ginger ...and he thought they may still have some jalapenos in the back - and expected me to fix it myself......I said no thank you....He said they probably had a different chef this time.   Well...my thoughts were that that chef should follow the damn recipe that was created!!!!  Service was disappointing  - they just didn't really seem to care.  Once I complained....they stopped bringing refills.  They had a live band on stage - music was way too loud in the restaurant - not the place to go if you want to have any sort of conversation.  There is also a 10% entertainment tax that is now charged in many Las Vegas venues - so be aware!!  I will NOT be going back  - Thank you to the 2 employees of HOB for ruining my previous high praises.",0.0,0.9996294975280762

We also wanted a place we could walk to and since we stayed at the Signature, we first looked at all the MGM restaurants.  I suggested CraftSteak.  Even though I have a crush on Tom Collechio, I don't think that justifies $120 per person for dinner.  We liked the varied menu at Seablue more so we made a reservation.\n\nI have to say, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable.  I don't know if that's a Michael Mina thing or an MGM thing but it is duly noted.  The decor and ambiance of Seablue really impressed us as well.  We sat against a beautiful aqua wall that was a fountain and it was quite serene and relaxing.  The dining room also wasn't too loud, which was impressive.\n\nSo they start you off with \""bread.\""  As noted in several reviews, this is delicious flatbread with three types of dips (hummus, egg plant, and feta spread).  Delicious...I didn't need an appetizer.  Also, they have a build your  own salad option, which I exercised (baby lettuce, beets, fresh bufala mozz, cherry tomatoes.  YUM!  Neither hubby or I are big fans of oysters so I can't tell you if they were good but they had many types to choose from.\n\nWe moved on to our own version of surf and turf.  I got the filet and hubby got the two pounds of king crab legs and we split them between the two of us...see?  We made our own surf and turf, isn't that great?  We're so smart.  \n\nWe both had two glass of wine as well and the bill was $170 so not too terrible but definitely a splurge.  I recommend Seablue for a lovely dining experience.  The food is very good, the service is amazing and it's away from the ding ding ding of the slot machines.",1.0,0.9996424913406372

The one star is for a great sommelier who was able to recommend a great wine by the glass each time.\nThe first time we went for dinner we ordered the friti mixto which came out a bit salty. I pointed this out to the waiter and was told that \""we don't use salt so its impossible for it to be salty\""..well it was and I had to insist that he taste it for him to take it back and come back and apologize and replace it.  The pasta dish my wife ordered was surprisingly too al dente and my dish was overcooked. We had ordered a side of roasted butternut squash which came out with slices of squash that had been boiled.  At that point we skipped dessert. \n\nOf course not willing to give up on this place, gave this a shot two years ago and again a few days ago.  I don't know what's up with this place but the service has been very bad with the waiters having a very laissez faire attitude towards everything.  On the last visit the appetizers were very slow coming out (did have a fabulous rose) and were not really up to par.  The octopus was a quite chewy (not what you expect from a Batali-Bastianich branded enterprise) and a rabbit confit was quite unremarkable.  I ordered the pork chop and was told it would be prepared med. rare.  I wanted it more medium ...which again led to an argument with the waiter (argument is too strong a word..but he did say that it was better to which I pointed out that a skilled chef ought to to able to cook this even through and yet leave it juicy...which is what I have actually had in Italy!)  This chop which was quite an expensive cut of pork came out quite dry though the mostarda went quite a long way and given the paucity of time, I tried my best to choke down as much as possible, skipped dessert and went out to the cheap noodle place for a roast pork dish which was 1/5th the price and much better IMHO.\n\nFor me, this place is a total avoid.  Its kinda funny to see Mr. Bastianich on MasterChef with a purile expression on his face throwing away food from home cooks when a branded restaurant cant do better than a home cook.  Just sayin' I do like his wines though.",0.0,0.998646080493927

I went in on a Friday late evening with three other ladies after an exhaustive afternoon of shopping (swoon!). We didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. The service was just below average. The waitress bustled over and asked for our drink order right away. Two women knew what they wanted. The other two of us said we wanted cocktails but we needed to know about their specialties to decide. The waitress told us at lightspeed about some of their cocktails and the vodkas they had then hustled off and didn't come back for 15 minutes, long after our other two ladies had received their cocktails from the bartender. We were ready for water or something at that poin as we were left without anythingt. 3 ladies split the wedge but we made our own. The one on the menu uses Thousand Island dressing so we subbed blue cheese. It was ok. I mean, seriously, it's a wedge. Anyone can make one; it's not really rocket science and it's always a staple on average menus. \n\nI ordered the chicken burger with the side salad. Side salad was some sad wilted lettuce with grated carrot. They have a house special vinaigrette but it was so lacking in flavor that I don't even remember what it was. Blah. The chicken burger was so bland and boring and dry. I ate half and wasn't even interested in taking the rest home. The beet and goat cheese salad one of the women ordered was great, though, and I would order that if forced to eat here again and it's the only reason this isn't a 2 star review. Overall, for one cocktail, a split salad and a boring, crappy, dried out chicken burger, $35 was a bit much to pay.

We generally have to drive out to Chandler or Ahwatukee to get anything decent; Maricopa isn't exactly booming with great places to eat or shop. When we walked in I liked the atmosphere of the bar; all the things hanging on the walls and from the ceiling was fun. It was pretty busy and it took a few minutes for someone to find us a table. Once sat our server introduced herself and took our drink order. She came back and we ordered some chips and salsa to start. We got our appetizer. The chips and pico de gillo was great but the other salsa tasted off...it had a metallic taste. We were waiting for our server to come back to take our entree order but she was running around to other tables. We waited, and waited...and waited. 25 minutes later another server saw our menus still on the table when she went to grab them l I told her we'd been waiting quite a while to order. She took our order; I asked for the fish and chips and my boyfriend ordered the meatball sub. Now we waited and waited...and waited again. The woman who took our entree order brought us more chips and salsa on the house for the delay. Finally after another 25 minutes we got our food. We were trying to stay positive thinking maybe all this waiting will be worth it. It really wasn't. My fish and chips seriously looked like those fish sticks you got as a kid. They looked very unappetizing and the portion did not match the price. Also the breading on them was falling off and was moist instead of crispy. I couldn't believe I was paying near $13 for 5 little fish sticks and some under seasoned, frozen, crinkle cut fries. This meal should really be priced around $8...$9 at the most. My boyfriend's meatball sub was also on the smaller side as well but he did say it was tasty, however they really jipped him on fries. Our original server came back, apologized, and refilled our drinks. The whole evening was kind of blah. I could honestly overlook all the waiting but what I can't overlook are the prices you pay for the food you get. It's truly not worth it. I'd rather make the drive out to Chandler or Ahwatukee and get better food and better service. We're not sure if we'd be back. Who pays $33 for cheap fish sticks and fries and a small meatball sub!? We could have gone to Outback Steakhouse and gotten delicious prime rib for that price.",0.0,0.998881995677948

The service was great. Linn was really nice. The sports bar tvs were really nice. The specialty cocktail was pretty nice. The food was not so nice. It was naughty and should get a lump of coal for Christmas. \n\nWarm Brie was disappointing. I thought it was going to be baked. It came out on a large dish with raspberry sauce, and all they did was warm up the brie a little bit and add six crackers to the side of the wedge of brie. I was expecting a more exciting tasting experience for $9. I could go to the market and buy cheeses myself and make a better cheese plate than brie and crackers and raspberry sauce. It was... a disappointment. Le sigh...\n\nProsciutto wrapped chicken was salty and a bit on the dry side, possibly because they had prepped the meat in advance and the salt in the prosciutto sucked all the moisture out of the chicken and made the chicken very salty before they finally baked it. The asparagus was good. The rice tasted like an instant rice, not from regular grains. It was flavored well with the olives, but the olives were also salty, so it was too much sodium for my taste. \n\nThe steak salad wasn't fully dressed. You need to finish tossing it yourself. The meat wasn't bad, although I asked for medium rare and received medium. Linn offered to change it for me, bless her soul, but I didn't want to bother the chef. \n\nThe bellini tasted pretty good and was enough for 2 to share. I heard in January they have a 6 oz. filet and martini special for only $9.95 that they're going to bring back because it was so popular before the end of November. Linn said that there would be a line starting at 4:30PM all the way until 10:30PM. I might come back and try this special.\n\nThe property is beautiful. The ambience is elegant and when it's warm enough, you can sit outside for a beautiful view. \n\nOverall, if it weren't for the service and the yelp voucher, I would probably not try this place again unless somebody else really wanted to try it. \n\nFood was meh... Service was the best you could get, the only saving grace.

The current online menu is from 11/12/2013. 4 of 20 items were the same.  \n\nMeat plate\nCheese plate\nMeat/Cheese plate\nBurger\n\nRestaurants, an online menu makes sense when it's updated! \n\nOdd door-front curtains. It's a cool entrance but corny from inside.. is it to separate crammed dining room from those waiting? It sticks out, and Bar Marco is more a dim-lit+high chatter+blend-in vibe. Dark with a stifling dash of hipster.\n\nService was slammed, one guy working the 8 tables out front. Our second round of drinks took 25 minutes. He apologized before we could comment when he dropped the check, so they're good enough to realize it. Descriptions were on-point 75%, occasional stuttering and stammering when questioned. \n\nThe bar is novelty. \""We have no cocktail menu\"" she challenged with a smirk. Game on! Drink #1 was awesome, ordered in person. Drink #2 was third-person via waiter, and it came out with 2/5 the ingredients asked for. Conclusion: SIT AT THE 6-PERSON BAR, WHOLE MEAL. That said, neither drink was more standout than a good cocktail from a printed-menu.. anticipate that novelty wearing thin on return trips.\n\nFood is decent at best, mix of tapas and classy bar. Cheese plate is a cheese plate, the earthy honey and jalapeno jelly the highlight. The fried smelt needs more lime and salt, the fish arguably too delicate for frying though the light mayo cuts the oil well. The tartare is well-diced with few clumps but way over-spiced, cumin masking the meal. The bolognese was bland and the sauce watery with chemical hints. Definitely could do with more salt and another minute on the noodles.\n\nIf the bar is one reason I'd return, the pork belly is the other. Everyone does pork belly these days. Bar Marco actually does it right: perfectly crisp edge with the piping hot sticky gob of fat melting in your mouth. No \""sour\"" per the menu, but the definite highlight.
