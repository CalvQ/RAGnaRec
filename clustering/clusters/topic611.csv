I went during the normal hours on a saturday.  Parking was fine, with no entrance fee.  I walked in to the store at the entrance to get some of their snacks.  They have great cinnamon buns, brownies, and other things they make right there with their own stuff.  I also picked up some pumkin butter they made there as well.  The largest thing for me was going into their pick-yourself harvesting.  Grab a bucket and walk to the field, and pick whatever you want!  Only $1.50/pound, and I walked out with $2.60 worth of vegetables which was enough for 2 people to eat for two days.  Everything is organically grown as well, which made washing the produce so easy.  Spinach, cauliflower, sweet peas, lettuce, broccoli, and a couple of other things.  I'm definitely coming back on a weekly basis while I can and getting my fill of vegetables!\n\nOne thing to remember when coming to this place is that it's a farm, not an amusement park.  There are things that may resemble an amusement park such as a train, roller coaster, and petting zoo... but remember above all that when you enter it's a working farm.  Also remember that every action you perform can destroy plants, so watch where you're walking and don't pull them out of the ground :-)  Also... please... control your children....",0.0,0.9833816289901732

We did strawberry picking in California with him a couple months ago and he loved it, so we were really upset when we left the Gilcrease Pumpkin Patch. The pictures are very inaccurate.

But my goodness this poor excuse for a \""pumpkin patch\"" is ridiculous!\n\nFist off, you can't tell who is an employee here. My boyfriend and I were both bewildered as to how the pumpkin purchasing worked, and on top of this we simply walked into the ranch without paying (upon us leaving I noticed a sign that said \""$20 per family\""). 20 bucks?! No. Way. I would never pay that much to walk into this tiny \""ranch\"".\n\nThere are a ton of horses, which were pretty much the highlight of the whole experience. But there was no clear way to feed them - or if it was even OKAY to feed them! There was also a Shetland Pony and a Clydesdale. After wandering around a bit we were both kind of amused and disappointed in our random trip here. \n\nNote: the place is like a hodge-podge of old stuff. Let's say an episode of Hoarder's threw up all over an outdoor farm area - that's what this place looks like. Oh, not to mention the random chickens just wandering around and the poor little billy goat I saw cowering behind a fence surrounded by cacti, probably because he was tired of all the little kids and people messing with him.\n\nMy boyfriend and I grabbed a pumpkin on our way out, but then realized neither of us had cash on hand to give to the guy collecting money at the door (first time I noticed any exchange of funds). So we deposited our pumpkin back where it came from and walked out, not having paid, not having had a really good time.",0.0,0.9995892643928528

Seven years later, I finally made my way down the driveway to check it out, and I'm glad I did!\n\nI went to meet some friends at their pumpkin patch.  Since it's unseasonably hot lately, and we all have young babies, we decided to meet first thing in the morning (at 9am, when they first open).  Smart move... even then it was pretty hot outside!  Luckily, MacDonald's Ranch has cold refreshments such as snoballs which we all enjoyed. (Thanks Jake B for treating!)\n\nUnfortunately though, none of us knew that the actual pumpkin patch was a hayride away, and none of us felt comfortable bringing our newborns on the hayride, even with the car seats in tow.  So, we did make it to the ranch but left empty handed.  I guess I'll have to purchase my pumpkin elsewhere this season.  That said, MacDonad's Ranch does offer a ton of other fun activities including a petting zoo, pony rides, music, etc.  They host all kinds of events too, such as birthday parties, weddings, and corporate events.\n\nOnce Baby M is a bit older, I will definitely return to MacDonald's Ranch, but I don't think I got my $8 worth (the cost of entry) this time around.

To the people who comapred the farm to places like the zoo or indoor amusement centers, keep in mind those places charge alot more than $3-7 per person, and they are a completely different thing.  \n\nAs for the person from CA, seems very arrogant to come in with an iPad expecting them to honor the coupon that way. Not everyone can afford  ipads, and mobile payment is still pretty new, this is a down home farm, not Starbucks, so that is like asking for special treatment.
