Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band.

She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator, we were lead to believe that MHI would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu. We wanted traditional Laotian food. They said that this was possible and so we signed. Everything that transpired from that moment went downhill. They did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the Chef to prepare our dishes. After several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these), the food came out ok. \n\nThe final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full,  which was completely inaccurate. They tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense. My planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to Billy, the owner. She also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok. After several back and forth, we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount.  MHI Planner emailed us midday and said the owner, Billy, would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled. We told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take. He said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay. We were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event b/c we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card w/o our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day. We never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there. I don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well. We had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of Billy. \n\nFolks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that.

I complained about the management and received little compensation for all that had gone wrong. \n\nIn the 6 months it took to begin planning my wedding reception to briefly following the reception I had 3 different events coordinators. The first two were amazing, but they left for good reason, the hotel events department was barely a-float. \n\nThere's literally a list of things that went wrong, but the two most concerning: \n1) The hired serving staff (many from temp agencies) didn't do their jobs! \n2) One of the hired staff were high/drunk, and when he and others were asked for help by my family were giving them sass and they still didn't help. \n\nDuring the wedding, all I saw was how things were going wrong. So unfortunately, I didn't enjoy majority of my reception. When you spend all that time planning and spending $$$ and things are being executed half ass or not at all.. it's pretty distressful for an already stressed bride. I complained about this, but it wasn't until I got in touch with Marriott International that anyone called me back. They admitted they were going through many staff changes and apologized for the various incidents. \n\nWhen you spend about $14,000 for SOLELY service and drinks (we catered food). I expect top notch service. My overall bill still had the 22% service gratuity (which they deserved NONE of - which I argued). In the end they reimbursed me $990 which was half the service gratuity. I hate to be ungrateful but that's ridiculous. \n\n\nMy only reason to write this review is because I wish I had known that their events services had gone downhill in past few years. I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great. People plannng events here should ask the following questions: \n1) Are they still using temps and what experience/requirements do they have?\n2) If things don't go right (which they have someone from the staff on floor during your events - so they can see it themselves), how can they offer compensation or fix the situation??\n\nAt the end - the temps were what were blamed for all the awful service (not clearing plates - my family cleared plates, serving drinks in CANS - when i made it a point everything should be served in glassware, etc...) So that's who I would ask the most questions about. \n\nI hope that things change for the Marriott in the future. They used to be one of the best places to hold large scale events in Madison. In the end, I do wish them the best in getting back to where they once used to be.",0.0,0.99723619222641

The 5 to 6 pm reception was delicious and excellent in the beautiful atrium. The problem was the wedding planner was given the wrong diagram. It was for the square room when we were given the larger rectangular room.  At least two of the tables was missing a place setting.  No biggie, just get another place setting and we would be happy. Instead, I (mother of the bride) was missing my place setting and had to ask three times and wait 25 minutes. My sister had faster results because after the wait staff argued with her about how the table was not missing a place setting, my brother-in-law went to get one himself. \n\nThe salad and green tea sherbet were great. Our entrees were salmon and New York Steak.  I was extremely disappointed with my first experience with an Omaha Steak. It was supposed to be medium-rare and instead it was well-done and dry. The mashed potatoes were dried out and crusty. The sauce was great and a lot more of it might have helped.\n\nThe result after I wrote to the corporate office was that the catering manager called me. I do not think that she understood what I had to say. She praised her staff for how great they were and how they kept the water glasses full. Hello! I did not even get a water glass! I wanted to hear how that issue had already been addressed and would never happen again to another guest. As for the dry steak, she said that she tried one at the reception and it was excellent. Yes, I probably got the first one off the grill and then it was kept warm too long, as a result, it was dry. Her steak that she got at a later point would be great. Some of my guests did say that their steak was great. I would recommend that if you are having a wedding reception there, that you add 30 minutes to the actual time that you want your steaks so that they are not sitting in the warmer. The catering manager blamed the wedding planner for the dry steaks so you know that she depends totally on the wedding planner's schedule.  Regrettably, she is not watching closely to see if the evening is running on schedule.   I suggest that she should be flexible and in charge of  the time for the kitchen to start the entrees.

As we entered I thought it was a beautiful place. It's vintage and eclectic. I loved the western feel of the place. Here's where my love stopped: the mosquitoes. We attended the rehearsal and the wedding. After being there about half an hour for the rehearsal, I had about 5 bites. Ok no big, deal, right? After the wedding ceremony the next afternoon I doused myself in bug spray that was at the cantina. By the time we left and got home I had 42 bites on my legs and arms. I'm not even someone that gets bit by bugs normally. I felt like I was swatting at bugs all night long. It was disgusting. Obviously the venue is aware of the problem since they provide bug spray, so you'd think they'd do more to solve the problem! I'm so glad I didn't get married at a place like this. I spent the rest of my 10 day vacation in Phoenix scratching at my arms and legs! Not to mention how lovely my legs looked covered in red bumps! HAHA! \nAlso only a handful of people danced. People were too spread out in the grounds and the bride even went \""missing\"" for a bit when she went to see people on the other side of the venue.

The meat was cooked properly, the chicken wasn't dry, the salad crisp, and one of my bridesmaids was SO impressed with the Donna's potatoes she  wrote a thank-you note to the chef on a napkin!  \n\nThe cake was fantastic, and looked and tasted better than I thought it would!\n\nThe DJ was enthusiastic, and (quelle suprise!) has even won Best DJ awards for Las Vegas in 2011!\n\nI was so impressed with the way everything turned out, I didn't have to worry about a thing or come to anyone's rescue.  Thanks to the team at The Wedding Room, it was the first time on my wedding day I  could just relax and really enjoy myself.",1.0,0.9994779229164124

I came here to watch my sister-in-law and her husband renew their vows at the drive-thru and it was a nightmare from start to finish.  \n\nHere's how my run-down with the employees went:\n-\""Hi, my sister is going to be coming through the drive-thru, where should we stand?  She's not here yet and there's another ceremony outside and we don't want to get in the way.\""\n-Blank stare\n-\""Should we just wait outside?\""\n-\""What's the name?\""\n-\""Melissa ____.\""\n-\""I didn't check in no one by that name.\""\n-\""Yea, they aren't here yet.  Is there somewhere we can wait for them?\""\n-\""There's some chairs by the window.\""  Points to outside and then walks away.\n\nSeriously?  You can't even act a little happy in a place where dozens of people get married every day?  You can't be a little helpful?\n\nSo Melissa and her husband show up in their limo and are ready to cheese it up in Vegas.  They fill out the paperwork, pay, and then wait.  And then they waited for 40 more minutes.  In a limo.  In the drive-thru. \n\nThey were ready to just forget the whole thing and get their money back but were told (by a completely unapologetic employee) that it would only be 10 more minutes.  Apparently we were waiting for a minister to do the service, even though they were only renewing their vows.  They don't keep someone around just for regular old ceremonies?\n\nFinally the pastor shows up, apologizes, and proceeds to run through the ceremony.  I videotaped it and it took a whole 4.5 minutes.  After the ceremony, he IMMEDIATELY hands them an envelope and tells them \""he doesn't get paid by the chapel.\""  Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh.\n\nI'm sorry, but you need to work out some kind of contract where you get paid per service you preform.  Or, the chapel should just require a tip as part of their pricing and give it to the minister to save him the hassle.  I really don't want to bad-mouth the pastor because he seemed nice enough, but to me that just seemed like it was in really poor taste.\n\nWhat bothered my sister-in-law the most was that she called THREE times ahead of this to see if she needed to reserve a spot.  Three times she was told no and that it wouldn't be a problem, just come to the drive-thru and she would be taken care of.  I guess the chapel just assumes people like to wait in limos (that are being rented by the hour) next to a dirty chapel for an hour during their vacation.\n\nThe chapel is old and beat up, the cherubs are falling off the ceiling in the drive-thru like they are trying to escape their misery, and the employees are slow and unfriendly.  After having my own renewal at Viva Las Vegas, I cannot believe how completely different this chapel turned out to be.\n\nThe only good thing about this place is that their services are cheap (before your tip to the minister, of course).\n\nI would only recommend if you enjoy top-notch Vegas kitsch or if you think you might have cold feet and you want to give yourself an extra 50 minutes before the ceremony to really think it through.",0.0,0.9996324777603148

We decided on the ever-so-famous Little White Wedding Chapel. \n\nNICKEL AND DIME YOU TO DEATH: They kept charging for everything that was supposed to be included-- Example: We already paid our $200 and something in total, but charged an EXTRA $50 for NOT USING their minister, which is weird since a minister is not required in real life, for anything, ever.  \n\nUNPROFESSIONAL: When it came time to check in naturally they said we owed even more money than that even though I had paid in full. It's interesting because I asked several times for a receipt in the weeks prior so I would NOT have this problem. WHy is it SO hard to email a receipt?! So here I am looking like a cheapskate arguing with an angry, incompetent female who apparently doesn't have shit for math skills and can't get her head out of her ass long enough to explain what the F is going on.\n\nMONEY HUNGRY: They also said they'd record it in case we want to purchase an over-priced DVD, come to find out they never recorded it and gave our friends the run-around. The staff is ridiculous and rude. The organist who didn't even play for us asked my hubby for a tip because she \""doesn't get paid much.\"" It's like this: Kiss my ass old woman, the ceremonies last 10 minutes, meaning you get a TIP every ten minutes. You didn't PLAY the organ for us. Of course my hubby tipped her anyway because he's a sweetheart.\n\nUN-SKILLED: If you opt for pics don't expect much. The photographer took every pic straight on. Every angle identical, no rule of thirds, no angle from above, below, or different sides... and forget lighting or anything else that makes a picture unique. (Not that I'm a professional. But I'm also not pretending to be a photographer like this dude.) Good thing we're a \""fun\"" group and made the most of our photos. :) At least the photographer was a nice guy.\n\nSO! if you want a bunch of rude, incompetent, no-talent ass clowns you've found your venue.\n\nOn the plus side it's surrounded by porn shops and passed out hookers.

My husband and I got married here last weekend. After a brief snafu with our reservation and a mix up we ended up with a better transportation option. We were supposed to have a regular limo for us and six of our guests. In the end we ended up in the hummer, which worked perfectly. All of our party was allowed to travel with us. Sam was a fantastic driver, he let us pump up the music, and dealt with our rambunctious party in a way that seemed happy and not annoyed. Sam also was gracious enough to take many pictures on many different cell phones for our party. \n  The chapels employees made everything so easy. We filled out a few details on the paperwork provided by the chapel and the marriage department of Clark County, then it was time to get on with the show. \n   I do not know which chapel we were in, I only know that is is the smaller one to the right of the main entrance. The Chapel was pretty, not to overdone. The best part of the chapel were the mirrors at the back of the chapel, these provided a nice back view for my dress, which would have gone unseen for the most part. \n    Our minister Chris was hilarious, charming and got our whole party involved. We are a slightly rowdy group when you add a bit of alcohol. The ceremony itself was perfect, short, sweet and to the point. Chris also has a great Elvis impersonation, and we have the pictures to prove it.\n     Carlo our photographer did a fantastic job of catching the love and happiness we feel for one another. He included our friends in a few pictures and let us cut loose and have a bit of fun. \n     We accidentally left our papers in the hummer and when we returned the following day and asked if anyone had found them, we were pleasantly surprised that they did in fact have them set aside. The package we chose came with a DVD and photo disc, one of which snapped a bit on our travels back to Los Angeles. When we called upon finding out that morsel of information, they offered to make a replacement for us for a small fee. \n     I could not have imagined a more fun and easy wedding, I am very happy that we ran off and wed. I highly recommend it to anyone that isn't the traditional bride and groom. In addition to the ease, it was extremely affordable. \n\n       Love Is Grand, isn't it?",1.0,0.9991807341575624

Well me and the hubby, it was OUR special day not just mine- seriously though, I was not a bridezilla.\n\nOnce upon a time, a very long time ago. Well 2007 hubby proposed. I wont go into the story of how he proposed as that is not necessary. We straight away decided to start thinking about where to get married.\n\nWe had both decided against getting married in a church in the UK and wanted something different. Our first thought had been Hawaii, however, as both sets of parents and our siblings wanted to be there it soon became a reality that it would be way too expensive.\n\nSo, Las Vegas it was.\n\nAfter much research we picked the Chapel of the Flowers, firstly because there was a choice of chapels and secondly because it looked like a decent place to get married. We settled on the victorian chapel.\n\nWe booked a package online. Had we been staying on the strip (which we were not) we would have had a limo provided to pick us up and drop us off. Obviously we didnt get this part of the package.\n\nThe package included roses, a photo pass to allow us to take photos for extra time after the photographer which they provided had taken pictures, the service itself, music and we also got a dvd of the service. The service was broadcast online for 8 hours after the event to allow our friends and family to watch in the UK.\n\nWe headed to the chapel a couple of days to do final things such as provide them a copy of the wedding license and pick music. They also ran through with us what times we had to get there.\n\nThe day of the ceremony was without a hitch- it was clear that they were extremely professional. What did make me laugh was the reverend had a stamp to stamp his name on the certificate rather than signing. It makes you realize that they truly must carry out a lot of weddings!\n\nWhilst having photos taken you can quite easily forget that you are on the seedier end of the strip- in one of the photos one of our party had taken you could see a sign for another business and at one point we had a bum walk through.\n\nA couple of days after the wedding we went and had the chance to look through all the photos which had been taken on the computers they had there. Of course we couldnt pick so ended up paying for the whole disk!\n\nChapel of the Flowers really made our day special and we didnt feel like just ANOTHER couple getting married in Las Vegas.",0.0,0.995455265045166

The prices are pretty cheap when compared to the hotel chapels in Vegas. The pictures here at this chapel is pretty expensive but they capture the moments to make your wedding that much more special. Now I do have so gripes about this chapel. I don't think it's reasonable to not allow the guest at the wedding to take pictures during the ceremony. I understand that the guest flash could throw off the pictures by the photographer but I still believe at some point the guest should be allowed to take pictures. Other weddings I have been to, the guests have taken picturess and the weddings still turned out good. Another issue that really upset me is the fact they I was not allowed to say my real vows. If you allow people to write their own vows then let that be. You can't give them the option but still dictate what can and can not but said. That eliminates the creativity of the couple. Lastly, the ceremony had to be restarted due to technical difficulties with the webcast. I'm very superstitious so I hope that isn't a sign of things to come. Now I got that out the way I loved the ceremony once it started. My bride and I worked with a lady named Michelle and she was very attentive to us and tried her best to accommodate our needs. She gave the best package for our money and the number of guests we had. She gave us numerous options to have our reception dinner and many are pretty reasonable. The chapel of the flowers take great pictures and capture the moments that we really wanted.  It started a little late but what wedding starts on time lol. The staff there is very nice and do there very best to make you comfortable. I'm not sure of the lady's name but she seen I was pretty nervous and she told me \""Mr. Jones, you need to have a sit and chill out\"" lol. She talked to me about her family and where they were from. That took my mind off things. The minister, coordinator, photographers are all friendly.

While it was initially difficult to get a hold of the wedding planner assigned to me, she explained when we finally talked and more than made it up with her helpfulness and friendliness. She answered every question I had and helped walk me through the entire process- even when it came to getting the marriage certificate.\n\nI picked this place because it had one of the most elegant looking websites. I was not disappointed. The photography packages are no different than if you bought any professional photography package. It may seems more expensive than other chapels in Vegas, but you get what you pay for. I spent more on the photography than the wedding ceremony, and I am so glad. The photos were AMAZING. All my friends and family are surprised at the quality and agree that the photos came out great. Their photographers are truly professional photographers. Ours told us all about her photography schooling and was very knowledgeable when it came to posing us around the chapel based on the natural light. Plus the photographers were fun. We had a blast during the photography session. We got way more photos than were promised to us with our package, though we did get the surprise \""For $300 extra dollars you also get these extras.\"" I bought into it. You only get married once right? (or at least that's usually the plan). They also accidentally made two videos, so they gave it to us for free.\n\nI saw a few complaints about the gratuity envelopes, however it is mentioned on their website and it is optional. Just like waiters and waitresses provide a service and get a tip, these staff members did too. I work in the food service industry though, so that might be why I wasn't bothered by it. I like that they gave a recommended gratuity (min and max) because I really wouldn't have known what was standard otherwise.",1.0,0.9983850717544556

They probably had other weddings right before and right after ours, but when they were with us, we were all that mattered.\n\nPastor Al was great. He gathered some information from us to use in the ceremony (where we're from, how we met, etc.), and also managed to pick up on a couple of details about us just from overhearing us talk in the lobby. That was a pleasant surprise. \n\nI could barely remember the ceremony after it was over, thanks to nerves, so the DVD they sent us home with helped us relive the whole thing when we got back. The videographer was pretty good; he caught all the important moments at all the right angles, and he queued our music at exactly the right times for maximum impact (including the Rick Roll of our audience at the end). \n\nThe photographs are stunning. I can totally believe they're rated #1 for photography in the country. Our two photographers were unobtrusive during the ceremony-- I didn't even notice they were there-- and they were very professional while corralling all of our friends and family for group shots afterward. A side note about the price of the photographs: yes they're expensive, but they're also much, much cheaper than you'd pay for professional photography at a traditional wedding. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because, like other commenters noted, the suggested gratuity for the drivers, photographers, and officiants is pretty steep. It should be included in the package price or stated more conspicuously on the chapel website, and the couple should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to tip a little more for above-and-beyond service.",1.0,0.9634835720062256

We ended up spending a grand on the ceremony, and the limos. Unfortunately they love to nickel and dime you. It was really important that my husband did not see me before the wedding and they charged us money to accommodate my needs. They also forced tip envelops into our face once our wedding was over. They wanted us to tip everyone who worked there that night! My flowers were also an issue, I couldn't bring in my own flowers unless I for fitted the flowers I purchased in my package.   Soo lame!!

You can have your ceremony in the courtyard, in the modern art gallery (which is what we did), in the front lobby, or on the front steps by the fountain. They have an enormous hall for the reception.\n\nPros:\n\n- It has that modern, not-at-all Southwest feel that my husband and I were looking for.\n- They do a couple of weddings a year, so they know what they're doing, but they aren't simply a wedding factory. None of our guests had ever been to a wedding there, so it felt unique and special.\n- There are so many amazing locations for individual, couple, and group photos.\n- The event managers, Heather and Jackie, were great. They got back to me quickly when I had a question; they included my husband in the process; they were professional and friendly; they thought of the little details that helped everything flow seamlessly.\n- If you have your ceremony in the gallery, as we did, there's a big staircase for a dramatic entrance.\n- You can have your ceremony and reception in the same place, so your guests don't have to spend time traveling.\n- The guys' ready room is behind a secret sliding wall. My husband got a kick out of that.\n\nCons:\n\n- It's $500 for the ceremony and $4,500 for the reception, so it's a little pricey.\n- You have to use their bartender, ARTenders, so you don't have much flexibility to keep alcohol costs down. \n- You have to use one of their preferred caterers, but they have a long list. We went with Santa Barbara Catering, and they were fabulous.\n- The marble floor can get a little uncomfortable for dancing in heels. We put out a bunch of flip flops in a variety of colors and sizes (labeled \""Sandals of Relief\""), which were a big hit.\n- The ladies' ready room isn't that attractive for the getting ready photos.\n- When you're doing walk-throughs and meeting with vendors, you have to pay $10 admission, but they're free on Wednesdays.\n\nOverall, we are so very happy we got married at the Phoenix Art Museum. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, beautiful wedding location.",1.0,0.990047037601471

The Wright House has soooo much potential, but they fail big time. \n\nI was a bridesmaid a couple of weeks ago at a wedding and reception that were held at the Wright House. I actually told my friend the bride that if I were in her shoes I would not tip her coordinator (Tiffany) a dime. Reasoning below:\n1. Tiffany told us that she would be near the wedding and visible all night, We could NEVER find her and all 4 bridesmaids would have to go looking for her if we had a question/issue. \n\n2. When we were doing the rehearsal, we had issues with some of the bridesmaids sinking into the grass, instead of offering a solution we got a snide \""I cant pour concrete in one day\"" remark from her. Not cool. The brides step dad brought 2 stepping stones from his own yard for the girls to stand on, problem solved. \n\n3. Tiffany told us that the bridal suite would be locked AT ALL TIMES and that we could leave our purses and valuables in there. She said to just come find her (ya right) when ever we needed anything. On 5 occasions through out the night I went to the room and it was UNLOCKED each time and no Tiffany in sight. Not cool. The Wright House is on a very busy street and any one could walk off the street and right inside and could have taken our things. \n\n4. I thought the DJ was our personal butler! Before the reception got started he took the whole bridal parties drink order, brought us our drinks and got us refills when we needed. I didn't realize he was the DJ until it was time to get the reception started. You would think that Tiffany would maybe check on us like he did, no such luck. \n\n5. When the bride went back the following day to get the rest of her stuff, some things had been misplaced and not kept safe like Tiffany had told her they would be. \n\nAs for the place itself. The garden/ceremony area is sooo beautiful and very well maintained. \n\nThe reception hall and bridal suite on the other hand is a JOKE. The carpets in the bridal suit were filthy! The reception hall had decorative tables displaying flowers and such, the tables were shabby and you could see broken off pieces just hanging from them. \n\n\nIts a shame.

We were happy with the services and how everything turned out for the most part during the actual wedding day so kudos to Graceland Wedding Chapel for that. \n\nThis review is actually for after the ceremony. The photo package is very confusing. My fiance specifically asked if we could have a digital copy of our photos upon arriving to the chapel the day of the wedding. He was told yes. Now, what he wasn't told was that the photos included in the package would be an additional cost of $10/photo to have a digital copy. Honestly, had I known they would print and send us copies 3 TO 4 WEEKS after the wedding was completed, I probably would have gone somewhere else. Printed photos don't really do much for us nowadays. We wanted to have one of the group photos as the front of the thank you card for our guests, but now we can't because we the photos will take too long. Anyway, they should be more clear when explaining this. Wedding photos are very sentimental and should be available right away. Especially since the photos are uploaded right away on the photographer's website. I've been around long enough to know that it's probably a simple feature the chapel has disabled. It's time to catch up with the times.\n\nThe next review is for the actual wedding certificate. This is partly the County also, but we weren't told to collect our ACTUAL marriage certificate from the courthouse by the minister or the Chapel. With all the commotion of the pictures after the ceremony, I thought the minister handed us our certificate. I purposely took Friday off work to go to the DMV/SS office to complete my name change but upon arriving, I was told this isn't the actual certificate. I called the Clark County Marriage Bereau and was told it would be 2 weeks before I can receive this or I can go in person to collect it. Obviously, I cannot do that being that I am already back at home in California.\n\nAll in all, the actual day of the wedding experience wasn't too bad for the price we paid. The aftermath is a different story. I would have much rather paid more money to have photos available for download (with purchase of course) rather than wait 3-4 weeks for my pictures. It is 2011 and photos/documents should always be at arm's reach, especially from a chapel that has a wedding every 30 minutes and a county that must collect so much from the taxes paid by the casinos. \n\nWell, I just submitted my request for my photos. Let's see if the 3-4 weeks is a true estimate.",0.0,0.9975760579109192

Everyone had said such nice things I thought this would be the perfect place to have our wedding. I planned this trip for months, we had the dress, the suit, the family, the cake, I mean we had everything a big wedding would have but we wanted it to be fun so we landed here.\n     It started out okay the limo picked us up from the hotel and took us to the chapel. Upon arrival though we were not really acknowledged, there were people lined up to get married after us so the chapel was small and cramped. Not one person that worked there told us where to stand. So we ended up just standing in a corner. Then the person that married us came out and asked us our names, I booked two months in advance he should have known our names. Then my family seated, my husband got into place, and Elvis came out singing. Okay perhaps this doesn't sound strange but it was. He never looked at me, acknowledged me, introduced himself or anything. He just started walking and I had to follow. After the ceremony the guy taking the pictures (who by the way didn't introduce himself either) rushed my family out of the chapel, closing the door on them and calling them the peanut gallery as he did. I mean how rude that is my family, they love me so they clapped after he pronounced us man and wife. They weren't being really loud, they were just happy for us. So on we go, he continued taking pictures all the while talking to the Elvis about the sound system in the chapel. Again here we were standing being ignored, and every few seconds the photographer saying turn, kiss I felt like we were messing up their day by being there. How horrible I felt, I put so much work into this and I felt so bad for my family, they came all the way from Fl. to be with us and got treated so bad. So then the real topper on the cake. As we go to the limo to leave we have to knock on the window to ask if that was our limo (he should have gotten out when he saw us coming). Then we are standing in the sun waiting for him to open the door for about five mins, as he proceeds to have a conversation with some other random guy about the oil pressure in one of the other limos. I thought my sister was gonna claw his eyes out. It was so hot and she kept saying excuse me and he kept ignoring us. It was the perfect ending to this wedding.\n     Everyone has bad days, I guess we just caught all the employees here on a group bad day. It was very disappointing, and I felt so bad for my family.

The steak was cooked to order. My husband ordered the steak rare and it was perfect! I ordered the chicken and it was amazing - it was basically half of a roast chicken - juicy and delicious!

It was a wonderful experience attending as a guest. We enjoyed the ceremony, as well as the reception that followed.\n\nGoogle maps for some reason directed us to the residential area next to the country club. We quickly realized and fixed our route.\n\nThe ceremony:\nThe scenery was quite beautiful. We were outside on the grass adjacent to the golf course. It seems like the perfect place to have an outdoor ceremony. A few people were golfing, but it was not a distraction at all.\n\nReception:\nHors d'oeuvres were served immediately following the ceremony. My family was required to stay with the wedding party in order for the photographer to take pictures. As a result, we missed some of the hors d'oeuvres. I did get to try one of them, the shrimp cocktail. It was nice, succulent, decent sized shrimp.\n\nI have three kids, and we weren't sure if there would be highchairs at the reception tables. A staff member named Lameer was very kind and helped us get two high chairs. Another staffer (forgot his name) was able to sneak us five apple juices, since there were no kid drinks available at the bar. My wife watched the kids while I went to get our dinner plates. A lady staffer offered to help hold one of my plates while I was filling the other. Overall, a very friendly and professional staff.\n\nThe dinner was buffet style. There was an array of items: pasta salad, caprese salad, garden salad, chicken, steak, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a wide variety of desserts. (I wish I had snapped more food pics, but I was busy watching my kids and just trying to maintain control of them while simultaneously trying to mingle and enjoy the moment.)\n\nIn conclusion, Las Vegas Country Club is a great venue for a wedding and reception.

My husband and I were running late to the reception and I got a frantic call from my Maid of Honor telling me that Buca swears that no wedding cake was delivered. I had to get in touch with the bakery, who called the driver who insisted that it was delivered at 9AM and he even gave me the name of the person who accepted the cake. We had to insist that Buca check the freezer for the cake. Finally, they did find it.\n\nOur reception was supposed to start at 1PM. We arrived at 1:30, but my guests were there at 1. Our party wasn't even served salad until 2. Once the entrees came, they were barely even warm. We specifically asked for a vegan salad and entree, which is on the banquet contract, and the server had no clue what we were talking about. My maid of honor had to wait for them to make it, and be served well after everyone else.\n\nThe server barely came by. We had to hunt him down to ask for things and ended up having to flag down a different server a few times. We had 3 people that didn't show up, so we had extra food. The server didn't even offer to box it up for us, he just threw away extras that we paid for without even asking. No one offered to help with the cake or even offered us any extra plates to serve it on. We found some plates on a shelf, and had to get them ourselves. We probably would have had better service had we just walked in and been seated at a regular table.\n\nI planned my reception at Buca because my friend had her reception there a few years ago and highly recommended it. She told me how great the service was and how helpful the staff was. This was only my 2nd time ever eating at Buca, and I was greatly disappointed with the entire reception. I just thought I would give you some feedback on how our reception went. \""\n\nOur wedding banquet was about $600. I wish we had spent the money elsewhere.

Now, I understand having to wait because of all kinds of reasons but 7pm is just wrong in my opinion. Even the kids were beginning to fall asleep.

The chicken dish had far too much soy sauce and I can't even remember the name it was that bad. The pasta dish that came out was cold and thin sauced. One example of service, our table was to have 8 seats, only 7 were set up, so, we asked 3 servers for a chair and plate, and finally one of us grabbed a chair which proceeded with the last server giving a plate and silver ware.\nThe saving grace was the location because it is beautiful out on the golf course and reception hall.",0.0,0.99892920255661

Walking into the Mandalay Bay I was blown away, I love how it smells like sunscreen, I love the classy floors, I love how they have a shark tank, I love the pool, and I can not wait to stay here for the bachlorette party... \n\nHowever, for such a classy hotel their wedding coordination services are sorely lacking. It started out okay, we showed up 30 minutes early and just stopped by to see if the coordinator was available and she was (I now see why!), we waited about 10 minutes and in that 10 minutes I personally saw 2 separate people come in upset with different issues. There was a new girl at the front desk who had no idea where to direct these grandparents where they should go for pictures, nor where she could find someone to help them. The man was upset that no one was answering the phone and they were running behind on some sort of paid for event. \n\nWhen the coordinator came out to meet with my blushing bride best friend, she took us back to the \""chapel\"" which is a beige room, pretty, but bland, not something my best friend was looking for. She didn't really say anything which was really uncomfortable - she gave us a booklet with information and basically left the bride and I staring at her waiting for her to tell us ANYTHING about the facility. No luck. Instead we grasped around for random questions we didn't really care about while standing in the middle of this medium size room.\n\nThis is why I had to give it one star - my friend (the bride) **specifically** asked the coordinator if they had any other options for ceremonies since she is interested in an out door ceremony and she said \""no, this is all we offer\"", so we shrugged our shoulders, thanked her and left for lunch - When we sat down to lunch and looked through the packet she gave us there is a WHOLE SECTION on the other options for ceremonies they offer - you can get married in the shark tank!! A cabana!!? Hello!? Are those not \""any other options!?\"" \n\nMaybe the coordinator was pissed we showed up 20 - 30 minutes early, maybe she didn't want to show us a cabana and the shark tank, but hello!? At least tell us about the options! Come to a meeting with information, talk about the services you provide! To convince a bride to drop 5000.00 you better be prepared! Completely disappointed. I have NO clue how they got the \""best of 2008\"" on TheKnot.com - yuck! \n\nLuckily, we came up with an amazing different option and her wedding will kick ass!

Since I live out of state, most of my communication with her was through email. \nThe day of the wedding, everything was absolutely perfect! Because I got married outside (not the smartest thing to do in winter), we had space heaters and a hot beverage bar. Penny helped coordinate everything from the space heaters, to the flower delivery, to the beverage set up. Almost every single guest has called/texted in the last week to rave about the ceremony! They were all highly impressed! There's no way I could have pulled off such a great ceremony in 3 months without Penny's expertise and hard work!",1.0,0.9990835189819336

We were right!  Nick had the kitchen custom make two cakes for us, accommodated a menu for 30 people and hired the bartender.  All we had to do was show up.  The service at the reception was amazing, champagne was given to each guest as they walked in the door, our Maid of Honor bought us special toasting glasses for the occasion but we forgot to tell anyone working at Skyloft about this, so we decided it was best to walk over the bar, get our toasting glasses and then make a toast, but when my husband and I walked up to the suite we were greeted at the door by the bartender who had our special toasting glasses filled with champagne for us.  It was amazing.  Our party guests were leaving wine glasses and plates of food all over the place, but you looked back one second later and the plates and glasses were gone.  At one point towards the end of the party we were busy playing a party game and the butlers walked over and started filling our wine glasses with a smile.

I was afraid that once we arrived at the chapel, we would feel rushed, like cattle being moved through the slaughter house.  That was not the case.  Actually, the staff was warm, calm, and very welcoming and if there were other weddings going on (which I believe there were), I couldn't tell.  Things did move along swiftly, but not at all rushed. Groom and I went through a two minute-long rehearsal run-through and went outside to meet with Elvis in the Cadillac while our guests were shown into the chapel.  Elvis (I think it was Brian) asked us how we met and about our first date and drove us into the chapel where the ceremony went flawlessly.  He incorporated our how-we-met story to make it a more personal event (nice touch!).  \n\nAfter the ceremony, we were escorted into a side room where a minister asked, \""Do you? Do you?  Okay, you're married!\""  Short, to the point, awesome!  There was a 15-minute photo session and guests were allowed to take pictures with Elvis.  I found him so accommodating and warm.  I know he must do this a gazillion times a day, but we all still felt very special.  That meant a lot.\n\nAs far as the online features, I couldn't be more satisfied.  The live webcast worked flawlessly and we had countless friends and family tune in to join us.  Also, we mentioned that we read the Yelp reviews and that got us a free DVD of the ceremony.  Bonus!  \n\nOverall, it was an absolutely fun and easy way to plan a wedding (how many brides can say THAT?).  The staff was incredibly helpful and made the process so smooth.  All our guests had a blast!  We really could not have asked for more!",1.0,0.9912651181221008

Where do we start. My fianc\u00e9 and I being huge Tom Jones fans, saw their ad for their themed wedding with Tom Jones.  We instantly thought it was a great idea and booked at the same day.  We really didn't know what to expect except for the fact that a Tom Jones impersonator was going to be marrying us.  \n\nIt started with a really great silver stretch limo ride with a really nice guy taking us to the chapel.  He had called in advance to coordinate the pick up time and how many people were going to be riding to the chapel with us.  He showed up on time and was very nice. He took us to the chapel in pouring rain. \n\n We got there and there was a wedding going on at the time. So all of our guest had to wait in the lobby for 20 minutes until we could get in.  We knew that this was one of many weddings taking place their so, we totally get it.  They went over some basic stuff that was going to happen during the wedding but the best was yet to come.  \n\nThe guy who plays Tom Jones is absolutely phenomenal!  He nails it from the looks to the accent and has a whole wedding ceremony that works with the Tom Jones song repertoire.  Everyone who was there was completely blown away, singing their heads off, and fully engaged.  His name is Harmik and he is as good as it gets!  He made it happen and did an amazing job!  Of course there was the kitsch of the theme but let me tell you, He overall message was very touching.  He had very great moments of sincerity combined with his act, making it such a great package.  There singing. laughter and there even some tears!\n\nMy wife and I are very pleased.  The only bummer was that they slow in getting us cabs and rides for the guest afterwards and the bar was slow to get guests drinks in the event center.  Aside from that, I highly recombined it.  \n\nJust about everyone said that this was the best wedding they had ever attended.\n\nThank you VLVWC!  You made our day very special!

First strike! \n\nOn the day of the wedding, we drove 5 hours from OC and get here 45 minutes before our appointment. The bride was behind by like 15 minutes and they didn't let any of us use the restroom until she got there. Second strike! There was no wedding before or after us.\n\nWe asked if they have a changing room so we can get dressed up.  They said there is not And told us to use the tiny bathroom to change. I walked to the bathroom and saw a dressing room open, unoccupied. Again, there was no other wedding before or after us. I don't think they are being very helpful about the situation.  What do they have to lose If they let us use the dressing room for a few minutes. Third strike! \n\n\nOn a positive note, the wedding was done quickly. The photographer seems nice. Hopefully we will get some good pictures since we were not allowed to move around to take pictures during the ceremony and no group pictures were allowed inside the chapel. They definitely want you to purchase pictures from them. \n\nOverall I was not very impressed about this place. I would not recommend this place.",0.0,0.6888222098350525

We looked around for a chapel in Vegas and found that this one was our favorite.  We really liked the marquee option and 50's diner.  On the web site it also said you could create your own wedding package.  I emailed the chapel and one of there wedding coordinators responded right away.  Shannon was awesome and every question I had she responded quickly and it was super easy.  She said I could pay in full at the chapel the day of but I didn't want to deal with that the day of my wedding so she told me how to pay online.  I emailed Shannon and she assured me that I was paid in full.  The day before my wedding I went in and the gal behind the counter assured me it was paid in full and I signed my receipts.  The day of my wedding completely different story. They said I had a balance remaining.  I told them I had just been in there and they said it was paid in full.  They couldn't figure out what the problem was but said I could talk to the manager.  I had my whole family there so I wasn't about to delay my wedding to do so.  We were on a time frame because of dinner reservations.  I paid and said I would talk to the manager after.  When we walked in everyone was there and that's when they decided to ask us what kind of vows we wanted and music.  The flowers were wrong which they corrected.  The photographer was a Gestapo!  Everyone thought she was a *****. The minister was AWESOME!!!!!  SO MUCH FUN!!!  At the end we had to take pics and when I said that I would like a certain pose she cut me off saying we weren't there yet.!!  My wedding was not even 5min long but the photographer was rushing us through.  I ended up writing a email to Shannon to express how I appreciated her but how it fell apart and I would just like a refund for the extra I had to pay on my wedding day.  She responded quickly and was awesome.  Her manager Brian emailed me right away and said he could give me a refund or give me a credit on pics.  We chose the pics.  He was great.  Chose pics and when I finally got them, they sent them to the wrong address,  2 where wrong.  One was the wrong size and one we didn't even order.  I emailed Brian and he was great once again, forwarding my email to Cindy who was in charge of the photos I suppose.  She not so great.  She said the one picture was not the right size because it would have looked bad and she said she would fix the other picture. She never called to explain the wrong sized picture.  If so I wouldn't have even worried about it or brought it up.  She didn't apologize or anything.  \nI was going to give a better review because Brian was on top of it but the pictures are the last straw.  Come on!!!!",1.0,0.8757529258728027

We requested a special theme of our own....Spaceballs. \n\nYoan contacted us early on and was very prompt and clear with his instructions on what we could or could not do and what the charges were. We made our deposit and continued to talk with him regarding plans. We had a wonderful experience but there were also a couple of things that could have been done a bit more efficiently...\n\nPros:\n- Super fun! The officiant dressed up like Yogurt and did a great job at making the ceremony fun! \n- The chapel was a great layout. Loved the smoke and the entire ambiance of the church. The way they introduced Yohgurt was awesome!\n- They accommodated our larger than normal party. \n- All of the staff was super nice. \n- Limo was on time and super friendly!\n\nCons:\n- If you have a fairly large party (more than 10, we had about 30), there is no place to wait other than outside. There is no place for large seating, so most of us were standing in the sun. \n- She asked what names we go by. We stated several times it was Ricky (not Richard), but the name still came up as Richard. \n- There was some confusion as to what we requested in regards to officiant. I talked to Yoan a lot about the officiant situation (we had our own but was told we also had to pay for theirs). We were told their officiant would work with ours to create a ceremony, but that never happened. When we arrived, we were asked repeatedly if we were having our officiant or theirs do the ceremony. It took some time to resolve it and honestly the staff we talked to never really listened to what we needed. However the officiant (Yohgurt), was amazing and fixed everything!!! He really saved the day!!\n- I didn't realize that the live feed was not included in the package. We had to pay another $25. The guests saw it but I can't see the 30 day archive yet on our page. \n\nAll in all, it was a great experience! I don't think any other chapel would be able to pull this off!!! The officiant was fantastic, but I think their support staff needs better organizational processes for details. \n\nThank you so much Viva for making a memorable wedding!",1.0,0.984980583190918

I have to say it was a great experience. My two friends and I had a ball dressing up as Elvis and my wife as a Marilyn Monroe and my nieces and friends as various other characters. \n\nIt was a pleasure dealing with the staff at Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel. Olivia, who was our wedding planner/coordinator was an absolute pleasure. Very friendly and helpful from the time I called to inquire, through the reservation process and checking us in and getting us through the wedding.  Our 'Elvis' was also awesome!  He made the event that much more enjoyable for all of us. Our photographer, Kalin, was also very pleasant to work with. He certainly knew his work and guided us through the staging of the wedding and the photo sessions afterwards. \n\nI would have given Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel five stars but for two reasons, albeit small reasons that could be improved upon. They are:\n1. Although my friends and I got lucky and looked great in our costumes, if you are doing a themed costume wedding, you may want to consider bringing your own costumes. While Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel isn't a costume shop per se, they could certainly look to upgrade the quality and quantity of their costumes. As I said I'm nitpicking. \n2. The limo service driver, who is employed by Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel seemed somewhat disinterested in our wedding when he picked us up. Rather than engage us in a friendly manner and make us feel welcome, it seemed as a chore to pick us up. At the end of our wedding, we were rushed to change out of our costumes and rushed in general because he had another pick up!  Not very customer friendly whatsoever.  If there are other jobs then the limo service should be spaced apart to ensure clients don't feel rushed!\n\nIf and/or when my wife and I renew our vows, I would without question consider doing so at Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel.",1.0,0.6695806384086609

The people there did not seem to be the happiest of employees, but I was too focused on the delicious tri tip to care.  Our waiter was great, though, and was very attentive.  I asked him if one of the food items in the salad bar had nuts, since I am allergic, and he took the effort to not only confirm, but gave me a run down of all the foods I should stay away from.  I am very thankful whenever someone in service is willing to go that extra mile, given the seriousness of my allergy.  This is a must visit for us every time we go to Vegas and people who like meat really owe it to themselves to go (hell, I'm not even that big a fan of meat, but this place is awesome)",1.0,0.9901235699653624

I had a wonderful planner on the wedding side named Lindsay and she has nothing to do with what comes next. Caesars just cancelled my wedding ceremony venue 3 weeks out due to ignorance in construction permitting that led all brides until August to find a new venue outside of the Juno Garden. I have already paid for invitations programs etc with this info on it. I'm sure there will be no reimbursement for this at all. Thanks for ruining my wedding day and all keepsakes from it. You construction manager should be fired and sued for incompetence. In the meantime my wedding is ruined and potentially thousands of other girls who got that call saying from today trough August all weddings aren't happening at the Juno Garden. Furthermore I tried to work last ear with your citywide group to secure a reception venue and they consistently blew me off and misquoted me and changed sept heads over the 3 months forcing me to secure a reception venue off property as well. Not a good sign Caesars it looks like you are on the decline despite years of supremacy on the strip. So beyond disappointed.,0.0,0.9995042085647584

The image stayed with me as one of the most romantic things I had ever seen - then a year ago I became engaged and knew immediately how and where I wanted to get married! I felt nothing short of a princess on our wedding day. The entire team at the Venetian - our wedding planner Rebecca Stebbins, the on-site planner Heather Curt, our minister Pastor Jack Williams, and both the videographer and photographer - were extremely professional and friendly! I was so nervous and excited before the ceremony started, and they really helped calm my nerves. As soon as I met them, I knew everything was going to go smoothly. Our wedding on the gondola was very intimate and special, and the video included in our package captured the ceremony and experience PERFECTLY. We were very happy that we were allowed to write our own vows - Pastor Jack worked around what we said to each other to create the perfect ceremony. My husband and I cry every time we watch the video, and it was so exciting to share the video with our friends! Although we chose to have our ceremony and day private with just the two of us, we also enjoyed feeling like celebrities for the day, as everyone who saw us getting married cheered for us! The icing on the cake was going to the Shania Twain concert after our wedding and being brought up on stage to meet Shania!

I had to make my own room reservations for the other nights and they don't have a way to link all the rooms, so I actually had to call the Front desk.\nI had to call Hospitality to order my cake, which was fine. I worked with Erik and he was extremely helpful. My cake turned out to be wonderful. It was way too big for 50 people, but everyone enjoyed it. \nI guess in my mind, a wedding coordinator is suppose to help with the entire wedding plans and not just filing papers or letting me know it is time for me to walk down the aisle.\nThe overall experience wasn't horrible.

We added an isle runner and rose petals and these stand up vases at each row. The minister was fantastic. I don't remember his name, but he did a great job. Flowers for the bridesmaid and for the groomsmen's lapels all looked great. Photographer was good, but all business...fine with us since we just wanted to get to our reception (pics turned out nice). \n\nThe reception was fantastic. the hand-passed finger foods (mini grilled cheese, brie, chicken satay, beef skewers, macaroni, and sliders) were all delicious, as was the cake. Most of our guests commented how tasty the food was and that is was the best tasting wedding cake they have ever ate. Drinks were great and served by two waitresses promptly...very pleased with that.

About 10pm the music kicked in and our wedding group hit the dance floor with the other patrons in the club.

Our coordinator Aleena was in touch with us every step of the way, which I found quite impressive since they crank out several weddings a month.\n\nWe purchased the First Kiss package which includes the wedding, pianist, minister, package of photos and a nice bar/hot appetizer set up in a penthouse suite.  I have to mention that the only 'hiccup' in this perfect plan was the fact that the penthouse suite was not available as per the package, so they 'upgraded' us to the vista suite (which was absolutely breathtaking), and charged us an extra fee for this 'upgrade'. However, with enough frustration I was able to get some of the charge knocked off and we decided to stay in the Vista suite for the night anyway since we were in the 'honeymoon' suite for the rest of our stay.\n\nI suggest going by the Chapel the day before the wedding even if you don't have a rehearsal so you can sneak a peek at the layout, and get a feel for how STRANGELY far the chapel is from the hotel rooms, you will definately need to allow for plenty walking time through the casino in your dress as people will stop you to congratulate you randomly.\n\nOur guests seemed to enjoy themselves, the only peep I heard out of anyone was that the bartender wouldn't 'open' until we were in the suite and we were delayed because of some outside pictures. In a 'do over' I would ask them to serve without us. The pianist followed us up to the suite and played through the whole reception, which was unexpected, pretty cool.\n\nAs an added perk, Brad and Angelina were staying in the suite directly above us (apparently, they bumped us out of the penthouse! *shakes a fist*)\n\nThe minister was sensational, non-religious by request, he said some very moving words during the ceremony and allowed us to recite our own vows. A very touching moment.  ALSO, I recommend the webcasting, this was a true blessing for all of our friends and family who could not attend!!  (plus us getting to watch it during our honeymoon after all of the hoopla had died down, very sweet moment for us).\n\nAll in all, amazing time.

I changed my venue last minute, so to plan a wedding in less than 5 months was kind of crazy. The decorations, flowers, and colors just all came together so perfectly.

After arriving at the small parking lot, shocked by the size of the chapel which is significantly smaller than the picture, I patiently waited 40+ minuets for my 5 minute ceremony. While being promised professional pictures, the photographer hastily snapped a few crappy photos that doesn't even illustrate the theme and moment. Some pictures were even slanted!! These pictures were so bad that my 7 year old cousin can take better pictures than the \""professional\"" photographer. The camera is a cheap canon that is only worth 450 dollars retail and was only equipped with a standard 18-55mm lens. No add-on flash or any other accessories were equipped with the camera and they prohibited me to use my canon 7d fully equipped in the chapel. Despite the quick 5 minute ceremony, the pastor gave me an envelope asking for a 60 dollar minimum to 100 dollar gratuity. After giving her a good tip, it took her two weeks to file the marriage record. I called them many times about it and the response I received is that they have 10 business days to file your marriage record while there is nothing they can do for me. After the 10th day, they finally agreed to contact the pastor to see what was happening and promised to call me back but I never got a phone call or voice mail from them.  If you would want to wait 30 plus minutes for your 5 minute ceremony, pay a huge gratuity, be over-charged for the crappy pictures they take with a non-professional camera, wait at least two weeks for them to file your marriage record, and poor customer service with no reply after calling them many times to ask for an update, then A Special Memory Wedding Chapel is THE place for you.",0.0,0.9996521472930908

The Patio was huge and accommodated around 125 people to watch the amazing sunset over the mountains. The food they served was pretty descent for wedding food.

I will start with a review of hosting a wedding reception at this venue.  While planning our wedding we knew that the Arizona Biltmore was where we would like to host the reception, but didn't know if it would be affordable.  We were in love with the Aztec Room - it is so romantic with two fireplaces and an intimate feel which was perfect for our smaller reception.  \n\nWe made a call and met with Lindsay Russell and she was FANTASTIC!!!  She took us around the grounds, explained the different options and provided answers to all of our questions.  She was very responsive when things came up along the way and we had a lovely wedding reception.  It rained the day of our wedding and Lindsay went above and beyond to cancel the heaters we rented for the outdoor reception since it was being moved indoors.  She didn't have to do that, but she took the extra step to save us money which was really awesome!  \n\nSo, why isn't the review 5 stars?  Well, a few things:\n1. When we planned our reception the Arizona Biltmore contracted out the wedding caked to Classic Cakes & Confections and we did not have a good experience there.  I brought this to Lindsay's attention and she ran interference so that we didn't have to deal directly with the bakery.  \n2. The suite I stayed in the night before the wedding was COLD.  I kept turning the heat up and called it in, but it didn't get better.  On top of that, the hot water went out about 10 minutes into my shower on my wedding day.  I reported it to the front desk, but left to get my hair done having had a cold shower which was a bummer.  \n\nI would highly recommend the Arizona Biltmore to anyone looking for a venue for their wedding or special event.",0.0,0.9642314314842224

I should've been more concerned when everything was so laid back, but that's me so I wasn't stressing.\nFor starters the package we purchased came with a one night stay that the chapel is supposed to book... Which they did not! They're reasoning was that we didn't tell them we were staying any other nights at the hotel. I'm not sure what difference that made but they fixed the error. \nThe ceremony itself was fun and the officiant really made it feel like it wasn't the same thing he had just done 30 minutes ago which I really liked. \nAs for the video.photography it was rotten! Our contract says no recording and no flash photography during the ceremony... the photographer announced NO PHOTOS period!!! NONE!!! After the ceremony the photographer was doing all the typical wedding photos that are wanted. Unfortunately she was relying on me to tell her what to do and when I finally said \""Ok, I just got married, never been married before this is your job why don't you tell me what pictures I should be doing?' Her response was \""Ok we're done here\"" With full on attitude... Umm I'm sorry but weren't we paying you to handle that part?\nSo we go the next day to check out the photos and was ready to have to drop some serious money as we assumed they wouldn't be cheap. We walked in to a desk with 2 8x10's, this cheesy collage thing and some other random stuff. We had 24 images that came with our package so we decided to go thru the 120 or so pics the photographer got. (Which was actually quite a bit for a 30 min ceremony) We seperated them in have to have & maybe & No.... WE HAD 12 HAD TO HAVE PICTURES!!!! That was it! 10 Maybe!!! The edited ones were elemntary photoshop... thr ironic part was that in one of the black  white images my flowers were the only thing in color.... my flowers should have been lavender.... THEY WERE PINK! I didn't catch it until then!! My best man should've had a lavender boutenierre and it was white! Long story short we left with strictly the 24 that came with our package and I had to call her again to get the photo album that was supposed to come with it as well..... which was recieved with yet another attitude! At the end of the day I'm married to my best friend and the service itse lf was great.... But I definitely wouldn't recommend them!\nP.S. saw the video when we got home.... not worth what we paid for it either!",0.0,0.99755597114563

I first contacted TSG in early 2013 for my October wedding, and spoke with one of the owners Crystal. She was friendly and to the point, and I decided to book with their catering business due to the great reviews and availability. Our meeting and tasting went well, and over the months they were relatively responsive to my requests. However, it seemed like after time, the responses were shorter and less thorough, to the point where sometimes I wouldn't get a response. I am very detail orientated and probably over-emailed on some subjects, but when you are planning your own wedding that does tend to happen...\n\nThe day of the wedding I was mostly busy getting ready, but as soon as the caters arrived I started receiving complains from my guests and wedding party about the attitude the caterers exhibited. I am not really sure where this is coming from, when they arrived there was even less work for them to do because I went ahead and had us set up all of the table arrangements... apparently there was a discrepancy about the placement of a table, where the coffee cups were, about a pregnant woman having some Hors d'Oeuvres before they were passed, about the home owner of the venue (my uncle) requesting a bottle of champagne for their table but being denied by  the bartenders..... ah, on and on and on. Cleanup was a huge rush, almost like they were rushing the guests to eat. \n\nMy biggest irritation was when I spoke with the rental company I used a few weeks after the wedding. There was 14 missing napkins and a ton of missing silverware, all of which I have to pay for. It's not so much the cost of it, while the caterers were responsible for the cleanup I realize some of the guests may have \""thrown\"" their silverware in the trash on accident.... but without any information from me or my guests, the owner of the company asked who I had the wedding catered by, because he could tell that \""whoever it was, did not take care of my items\"". He was referring to the dishes, the glasses, the silverware, etc. Hearing that from someone in the business, without any prompts from outside sources, was extremely discouraging.  \n\nOn a positive note - the food was excellent. Perhaps if they just remind themselves why they are there at the event in the first place, that it's not just a chore or a J-O-B but an extremely essential part of a landmark for a couple, they can align their attitude with the quality of their food. If that were to happen, they would definitely deserve 5 stars.",0.0,0.9903207421302797

We went for two tastings, and both times, we were amazed by both the quality and selection of food (along with our ability to consume and unbelievable amount of food in one sitting... come hungry!).  The catering for our wedding itself was professional, and the food wasn't incredibly different than what we tried at the restaurant (usually not the case).\n\nThe cons:  One of our buffet items never made it to the line for the reception.

So we have been in contact with the wedding coordination group since January 17th 2012, planning our wedding from away as we live in Ohio, letting them know our plans to be out in AZ the last week in March and planned on getting together to discuss in person. When we got there, the girl in particular was very stand offish and by NO MEANS put a personal touch on the planning. She stood on the patio and pointed where we'd be at for our wedding and did not even have the courtesy to go down to the lawn to show us options for rehearsal and set up. We asked if we could decorate, and we got the comment of \""you can decorate a little, very minimal, but NOTHING that would distract our dinner guests\"" SO...it is very apparent that they care more about disturbing their guests that people planning for their ceremony. We actually had additional people there and received comments from them saying \""It felt as if you needed to be careful to fit into their world and to be sure not to inconvenience them\"" Already bothered by this, we decided to still go through with it has we had exchanged 20+ emails with them, and thought we were in to deep as it was. When we received the contact, there was a 100% PRICE INCREASE!! I immediately emailed them back ad received the \""amount of effort, set-up and landscaping costs we incur.  We had some issues at the start of the year that have caused us to raise our pricing.  And we reserve the right to increase pricing\"" I abruptly asked\"" in the 20+ emails you could not have let us know this\"" and we got the ever so nice response of \"".  We communicate with hundreds of people each day and we cannot keep track of who has the most current information if it's something we emailed a while ago\"" REALLY?? REALLY?? Needless to say I was threw with them, and decided to take our wedding party elsewhere.

They only had amazing things to say about Trini and once I read about the rave reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to meet her. \n\nDue to a schedule conflict, Trini offered to meet my fiance and I at a place of our choosing on a Wednesday night during rush hour. Right off the bat, I knew she would be awesome to work with. We informed her that since we were paying for the majority of the wedding expenses ourselves and have roughly 300 guests, we were on a tight budget. We also have some venue constraints due to catering limitations since it will be a bi-cultural wedding (I'm Vietnamese and my fiance is Irish).  Trini not only listened attentively to our wants and concerns, she was also very proactive during the meeting. She asked us tons of questions, gave us options to look at and really tried to get a sense of our vision. Trini offered to review our existing budget to  see where she could possibly help us save on costs. A few days later she emailed me her proposed budget. I just could not believe it! She put sooo much time and effort into her proposal. Most event planners/coordinator will not do this until you actually hire them. \n\nAfter much thought, we decided to hire another wedding planner. It was a VERY difficult decision for us to make. We absolutely LOVED Trini, but decided to go with the other planner because she has experience working with the Vietnamese wedding vendors in the Orange County area that we already decided on. My parents are very traditional and therefore my venue options and creative vision for my wedding are limited. \n\nTrini is awesome! You can not go wrong hiring her.",0.0,0.9814578890800476

We asked for ZERO cheesy wedding songs, ie YMCA, shout, electric slide, etc..you get it... Welp, I guess cheesy wedding songs are his agenda because that's exactly what we got.  We were beyond disappointed and even more embarrassed. Not only that, they wanted me (the bride) to remove any and all decorations I had provided the second the reception was over.

Me and my now husband live in Seattle, he is from Phoenix so we decided to get married in his home town. I was destined to find a venue that had some components of the Northwest. I researched a few other places but it meant a lot of work like picking out individual vendors. For us that would have meant several trips to Phoenix and added stress. After some thought we decided that The Venue at The Grove was a good fit.\nWe booked an all inclusive package and I felt taken care of the moment that we signed our contract. Planning a wedding from out of town could have been really complicated but for us it wasn't.\n First of all I think that over a year I must have exchanged nearly 150 emails with our wedding coordinator. She was patient, helpful and thoughtful. Second, The Grove is highly selective when it comes to the vendors that they coordinate with. The Grove made sure that the vendors contacted me versus having to track them down. This was priceless in my opinion, my fiance are busy and I didn't have much interest in planning a wedding. My cake was delicious and beautiful, we were hoping that it was going to be a bit larger but it's not that big of a deal. The flowers were stunning. Our photographer was Cheryl from La Bella Vita Photography, she was amazing. Cheryl has a calm confident energy and she knows what she is doing. The DJ, Tony from Infinity Entertainment was attentive, energetic and smooth, he even stuck around when it started to rain at the end. \nThe Grove staff is amazing, one of my favorite experiences was the tasting. We got to sit down with the owner Edward and also met the Chef.  We went into our tasting with minimal expectations. My husband and I are big city food snobs, but we were impressed with the food! It was tasty and they take the time to make food from scratch which is something that we value. \nThe wedding day went off without a hitch, with the exception of a little rain. The ceremony was lovely and the reception was fun and entertaining. \nI must say thank you to Taylor, she was our coordinator and she took very good care of us. She even went to grab my other pair of shoes out of the bridal suite after the ceremony. \nI feel like our wedding planning experience was effortless on our part aside from making decisions like table cloth colors and sending invitations. Most of my friends and family stated that I didn't seem stressed or worried. I repeatedly said that our venue is taking care of everything so there isn't much for me to worry about. \nThanks guys!!! \n- Gretchen and Ben",1.0,0.9988545179367064

So here goes... \n\nWhen planning my wedding, I was looking for a caterer who shared my food values. I wanted someone who would present my guests with some delicious local food; someone who would be low-key and easy to work with.  UFC seemed to be just what I was looking for. But then, I should have known it wouldn't be so easy.  \n\nFirst, I had to email approximately 15 times before I was able to set up a meeting with them. Since I live in San Francisco, I had a window of about a week  to meet with them. Needless to say, they weren't very interested in accommodating me. \n\nThen, the meeting. After the general unhelpfulness of our scheduling exchanges, my expectations were low, but wow! Now, I generally expect that when I meet with a caterer, I'll get to taste some of their food. Not so. I (sort of) understood, since they don't have a kitchen facility, per se.  I reminded myself to keep an open mind.  \n\nMost caterers will lead you through the initial meeting, getting a sense of what you're looking for, your budget, your style. Not this guy. What we got was... well, not much besides a lot of chef peacockery.  Now, being from San Francisco, I'm used to food snobs. I am fluent in their language - they are my people.  But UFC made me feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman - the scene when she is hysterically pulling wads of cash out of her purse, begging to be waited on in Beverly Hills. \n\nSurprise, surprise, they never called me back - another giant red flag - and I didn't pursue them either. I did send an email letting them know how disappointed I was, which (of course) was never replied to.  I would caution anyone against working with these folks.  Even though their mission and food seem to be top notch, their diva behavior is just too much. I only wish I could give zero stars.",0.0,0.9957457184791564

I got married at PH May 2013, and worked with Ali. She was absolutely wonderful! I can't say enough good things about her and the other ladies at PH. I was planning my Vegas wedding from the east coast and had never even seen the chapel. It's hard to plan an entire wedding by email and phone without ever seeing anything, but she helped put my mind at ease. I probably asked her a million questions, and she always returned my emails promptly and never seemed annoyed with all of my questions. I know that I wasn't theeasiest bride to deal with, but she was always very courteous. \nWe had two children in the wedding party who have a hard time with unknown situations (and this was the first wedding they were ever in.). The wedding coordinators at PH were nice enough to let them tour the chapel the morning of the wedding so they knew where to walk down the aisle, where to stand, etc. It really helped them be a little less nervous at the wedding! \n\nOur officiant, Nathan, was super nice and easy to talk to. He said very meaningful things during the ceremony, and coached everyone on what to say at what time before the ceremony. Everything went very smooth, espcially considering that we didn't do a rehearsal. \n\nThank you Ali and the rest of the PH Chapel staff for helping make our wedding day wonderful!",1.0,0.9995323419570924

Canna Lily was not the least expensive and not the most expensive. They were however, the most proactive and reliable company we spoke to.

What killed it for me? The lack of professionalism that was presented when my fiance and I came to look at this venue. I will admit that we were 10 minutes late to our appointment, however I do not think this warrants being treated like a herd of cattle.\n\nFirst when I called the venue to make an appointment whoever picked up the line sounded as if they were in a rush and not even interested in making the appointment which was the first turn off. Upon arrival, we walked into another entrance thinking it was the main entrance, then we were re-directed by an employee to the adjacent door. As we walked out there was (I don't even remember her name), the wedding coordinator waiting. She quickly greeted us then had us sit down as she began to talk about the venue. \n\nUsually when you want to sell the venue you run, you'd think you would see someone with a little enthusiasm and fire explaining why their venue is so amazing. Well, we didn't get that from this individual. What did we get? A quick 10 minute spiel about what they do and the services provided and 3 wedding books shoved in our faces as examples then a quick 10 minute tour of the place. That's it, no effort, no emotion, no interest in wanting to get to 'know us' and get a feel for what kind of wedding we would like to have, just a quick, here is the place, goodbye. She was very snooty and acted as if she was not in the mood to showcase the venue.\n\nSo why two stars instead of zero? One star is for the venue itself. It is very chic, modern, yet elegant. The reception area is beautifully decorated and where the ceremony is held is beautiful as well! There are many ways one can decorate this place! The other star is the PRICE. This venue offers all inclusive packages at unbeatable prices. I mean an all inclusive package where they provide virtually everything for roughly 100 guests is $9495.00 taxes and gratuity included!!! That's a steal, trust me, I've looked into a TON of venues, you will not find an all inclusive price as cheap as this. \n\nHonestly, if my fiance and I were the only individuals funding our wedding, then we probably would have considered this place (more than likely, VEGAS).

Traci and Scheme did it.  We flew down in September and met with her and finalized everything.  She spent multiple days with us explaining and showing us everything we'd need to have a great day.  What a huge load off our minds.  I can't imagine planning an event without some help and Scheme is one of the best in Las Vegas.  I started to sleep better once I hired them and I don't regret it for a single moment.  Do yourself a huge favor and hire them.

I could go on and on about how unprofessional and disappointing this was. They had an hour left to serve but she refused. The other trucks were AMAZING and they both reached out to my husband and I and apologized for Bee's terrible behavior.

But, for me, my future wife and mother-in-law, choosing Portico as our venue was a no-brainer.\n\nHere's what we loved:\n\n*Completely private venue. You don't share anything, not even the parking lot, with guests outside of your party. That way, photo-bombs are limited to drunk uncles.\n\n*Beautiful covered reception area with outdoor garden and large patio. The weather is unpredictable, even in April. At Portico, you've got a covered pavilion area for dinner and dancing. Outside, there's a fountain, several seating areas, a full bar, and even a beautiful garden ready to host your ceremony (if you choose to do so). Side rooms are also available for added privacy.\n\n*Optional BYOB! This is seriously one of the most underrated points. Like most other venues, you'll have to select a bartender. Here, you have the choice to bring your own liquor, wine and beer (keg). We created signature cocktails for the bartender to serve up. Note: Costco will let you return unopened bottles. \n\n*Inlaid dance floor. Though a subtle attribute, having a dance floor flush with the ground is a very nice touch. \n\nTrust me, there were many many more features of Portico that made it stand out above other venues we toured. Price and flexibility, included. I highly recommend anyone looking to have their wedding in Chandler/Gilbert to check it out.

So she had no idea that one of the bridesmaids was not in the wedding. She then shows up to the wedding late! Over an hour! The basic characteristics of a wedding planner should at least be smiling and being positive. This women was angry, always on her cell phone, and overall had a nasty attitude. She showed up in shorts and a tank-top, looking like she partied the night before. We asked her when dinner would be served and she actually put down her phone, and responded so nasty. To top it all off, the flowers for the bridesmaid arrived late where the stems of the flowers were to long. As the bride is in her dress, she asked for help to cut the stems. That wasnt Matu's job to help! So I see the BRIDE IN HER DRESS CUTTING WET STEMS WHILE MATU IS JUST STANDING THERE!! Out of control!! I was appalled by this women behavior.

I already booked them for up lighting and instead of simply asking what color I want the lights, these guys came out with their equipment and showed me all the different purples possible in up lights to help me customize the color for my big day.  They also have layouts and designs of the venues and meet with venues they are unfamiliar with to get a layout before the day.  They have intelligent lighting as well to add even more elements to the decor, they have the ability to do cake lighting, centerpiece lighting, gobos (monograms), pretty much anything you want to light up they can do it.  Besides up lighting, Ryan, Ren, and Troy also provide DJ/MC services...this being their primary passion.  They also brought sample mixes of their music.  They even joked that they thought about bringing out the turn tables to the meeting :p.  The other services they provide include: videography, event decor, planning, photo booth through iflick, photography.  With Vegas being a wedding city, there are endless choices for vendors.  Lighting options are a little more limited and I probably researched all the companies in Vegas and some in the LA area as well, including DIY up lighting and these guys have extremely reasonable prices for their services and they came at the recommendation of our venue who has seen their work in the flesh.  I would definitely recommend setting up a meeting with these guys to check out their services.  I never felt like they trying to pressure me into adding additional services and Ryan took the time to answer my endless questions even prior to the meeting.

I guess they figure people are blinded by love before weddings willing to be price gouged.  We proceeded doing a very simple ceremony at their very simple front room with many extra clutters nearby...\n\nAfter the ceremony started, the minister asked everyone's religions, which created a moment of awkwardness.  The ceremony went without any Christian references.  I guess the owner-lady was pissed at us for being cheapskates not falling for her money traps and assumed we are Mormons since we came from Utah.  She started lecturing us on how Mormons are not Christians, and proceeded to describe true Christianity to us sounding a lot like Jehovah Witness scripts, but we did not turn it into a religious debate, since all of us just wanted to get out of there.\n\nTheir last attempt to gouge money was a large tip for the minister, and an $80 dollar fee to apply the state issued marriage license for the newlyweds.  We did check at with the Marriage Bureau around the block and it only cost $15 to do so.

I found this place through Yelp, i saw some good and bad comments, when we looked originally good comments came up, 5 days before the wedding after I reserved i noticed some bad comments.  I called Melinda, Let me say that she is very helpful. she discussed the issues about how her minister is puts God first and puts that in his wedding vows. (we are ok with that), the the day before our wedding we arrive to look at the venue, once i wiped my tears and gathered my thoughts, i realized we need another location.  I wish i had pics of the outside.  its literally on the second floor in an office building not bigger then a 10x10 room.  However, she offered us another location for $100 more.  I had no choice but to take that.  we had 25 people coming the room she had fits 10 tops!  the next day we arrive at the new location (yes I am nervous to see what it is like) it is located on las vegas blvd. Vegas wedding adventures.  and the photographer on site. (anthony) didn't know we were coming.  so i again stressed! once that all got cleared. i went to a bridal suite to be out of the way.  melinda was running late, she still needed to pick up the fruit and vege platter and place it all for the guests.  mind you the guests had to then help to set up and we were 43 min early.  Anthony the photography by trade, helped my mom with her camera and bam he started taking pics.  about 15 min later, melinda walks in and starts taking pics,  she is the designated photographer (not by trade).  she ended up taking decent pics (that were part of the package) and I got about 200 pics instead of 75.  not to mention we had all our guest take pics and the ones from my mom's camera.  the minister (he husband) called my husband  a different name and we corrected him but it turned out just fine.  they are great people but i wish Yelp would have shown pics of the front of the location.  so if your in for a small quick $50 wedding this is the place to come.  if you want something reasonably priced call Anthony at vegas wedding adventures he will hook you up, and take GREAT pics.  \n\ncredit cards - yes they accept credit cards however there was a problem with the machine and it ended up double billing us.  we are still two weeks later trying to resolve it.",0.0,0.9715074300765992

We aren't those kind of people. We just wanted to be married without all the fuss. We were approached in front of the courthouse by this guy who said we could come here and have that done. He talked us into coming here, even though we were already going to go somewhere else. (Now I wish we had just gone there) We walked into this building and it's next to a bail bonds office in a run down office building. We were brought into a small office. We told Melinda that we did not want a ceremony, and that we just wanted to have the license signed to say that we were married. We told her we did not believe in that kind of thing. Immediately she started talking to us about god (neither of us are religious) She could have asked us if we had a religious preference, but no. She continued on her preaching by telling us that if we didn't have god in our marriage it would fail, and that it was no longer about my husbands happiness but only about mine. I DO NOT agree with that statement at all. Marriage is about both parties being happy, not just the wife's. Finally she stopped talking about god, but then wanted us to recite vows, which my husband is strictly against. He went back and forth with her for a bit, and she told us \""if I would have known this was going to be a marriage of convenience, I wouldn't have done it\"" She then proceeded to ask us if we were in the Military, I suppose to insinuate that we were there for a contract marriage. Now my husband and I both served in the Military and we are both out now, so this is for sure not a contract marriage! She then tried to tell us that it was illegal for her to sign the marriage license if we did not say vows, which is complete BS! She then said she would sign it but we would have to pay a minimum of $50 as a minister gratuity. Overall she got $100 out of us just to sign a piece of paper and give myself and my husband a headache. Our wedding will surely be memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Maybe they use the B team in the off season in Vegas.

The chapel and/or the minister should have asked about our religious affiliation or given us a description of what the minister was going to say. My SO is an atheist and despite being Catholic, if I had wanted to hear an old fart hint at my wifely duties in a heavy French accent, I would have gotten married in a church by Pepe Le Pew.  We assumed when we asked for \""normal vows\"" that the minister would simply ask us to take each other as husband and wife in sickness and in health blah blah blah. Instead, the minister went on and on (and on it seemed) and I suspect he was simply trying to kill time. I wanted to tell him to shut the hell up so Elvis could sing the next song. \n\nJack our limo driver was a class act. He took so many photos of us outside the chapel.

We liked a lot of the photos taken of us by the chapel photographer. \n\nIt's a lovely chapel with hardwood floors now, but really nail down which minister will be officiating and what he or she will be saying.

The photos online look amazing, and we were anxious to visit the property.  We called and made an appointment, and arrived a couple of minutes early.  We stood in front of the open door of the office for nearly 20 minutes, all the while the two employees inside (who could clearly see us) joked and laughed.  We finally stepped out back to take a tour ourselves.  \n\nWe were not nearly as impressed as we thought we would be.  The place is in need of major repairs, and the attention to detail just isn't there.  The windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time, as they were coated with smears, fingerprints, goop-like substances, and a layer of the desert's dust.  The floor of the main ball room was absolutely disgusting, and the women's and men's bathrooms smelled HORRIBLE (seriously, they smelled like a well-used Port-A-Potty after midnight at an all-you-can-eat deep-fried sausage event).  \n\nWe were just about to walk out the door when one of the two employees who had been jibber-jabbering in the office came to stop us.  When we told her that it was over 30 minutes past our appointment time and we needed to get going, she inquired as to why we just didn't come into her office and sit down.  Really?  So it's our fault that we didn't begin the meeting on time?  We told her that the place just didn't look how we expected it to look. She remarked that they had had a big event the weekend before, and that the place still hadn't been cleaned.  That might be true, but there were things that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!  \n\nFurther, the \""castle\"" is situated in an industrial area which is currently under construction.  If you're planning an event that does not take place in the evening, construction noise is a very real possibility.",0.0,0.9964823722839355

Did not choose them myself as they had an exclusive contract with the venue. When we did our tasting, I was already concerned with the presentation and quality of food. We were paying approximately $100 per plate and I did not think it met that level of food quality. I emailed her to express my concern. Her reply is that she \""never had a bride complain about her work.\"" Big red flag! Since I was stuck with her, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOn the big day, as I suspected, the food was a disappointment. We had a cocktail hour and paid extra to have more selected appetizers passed. My guests told me later that items were still frozen in the middle. Plus, they did not bother to save us a plate of the items so when I asked where our plate was, they had to scramble to put something together and we only got 1 out of 6 items. Pretty sad since we were paying for this event that they did not honor the bridal party. \n\nThe entree choices were prime rib and chicken. Once again, it was one step above cafeteria quality. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. Chicken dish was average. \n\nI budgeted a good portion so the food would be right. I feel food is a big part of a great party and it was my priority to have it well done. Even despite my concerns to her beforehand, she still blew it. So embarrassing to have frozen items served to close friends and family. You would think she took extra care to make it right after speaking to her.\n\nAfter the event, when I brought up the issues she basically said that they only budget $25/ plate. The rest is decorations and other stuff. Ridiculous that you do not inform us about that when planning the event. She did refund some money but it still does not repair the damage to my special day and the lasting memories of this problem. Warning to any bride if you are using them! Clearly there are other dissatisfied customers so this lady cannot even be trusted with her word. As a business that is a cardinal sin. \n\nI hope the owner reads this. If you are in the wedding business, you should have some ethics to realize your work is the realization of a lifetime of dreams. Do your job right! Not in a half ass way.
