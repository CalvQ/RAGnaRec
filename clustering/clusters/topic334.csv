Victoria's Secret may have big time busty supermodels, and leopard prints, but ain't got nothing on I C London fitting and customer service. I'm a totally different size than previously thought. \n\nWhen you're 100 pounds, even a 32 band is too big.  I C London is one of the few places where you can get a 30 band-- or have your current bras altered.  Who knew this service even existed!?\n\nWhen you get fitted here-- you will be adjusted, and re-adjusted and try on tons of bras until the SA or owner is satisfied with the determined size.  Over at VS, you're told what will fit you for the sizes they carry in store.  The fitters there are all given a formula for their pink tape measure, and once they determine what size you are-- eyeballs the fit.  \n\nTrust me.  The difference between wearing an ill fitting bra versus one built for your body is incredible.  Your posture will be different, the girls will be perkier and overall better shaped. \n\nNo, there is no funkified feathered stuff or neon colors-- primarily nude, white, black and neutrals.  Practical pieces that wear well under clothes.  (Need something for that strapless dress or one-shouldered tank, you'll find it here.)\n\nKeep in mind, the designers who make special sizes aren't cheap, but you'll be taught how to care for your bras correctly, and be shown special detergents to use while washing.  \n\nPS:  There's a nice section for super-comfy sleepwear too!",0.0,0.9418307542800904

So you can imagine my problem when I trawled round Marks and Sparks and Primark looking for a cheap bra in a 28FF, they didn't have it. In fact, the only place that had it was Bravissimo... funny that. So, by making up sizes that you can only get in Bravissimo they have a huge following. The prices are extortionate and while the underwear is very nice it's not really worth the price tag.\n\nPerhaps for women with huge huge knockers then Bravissimo does the job but I'm still not convinced when Marks and Spencers has been catering for all shapes and sizes for years.

Nothing crazy. Just standard special occasion underwear. Most gals wear such things under a bridal gown. I spent a week scouring Madison. All the department stores from JCPenney to Boston Store to Macys to Kohls. I checked Victoria's Secret, knowing it would be in vain (as their sizing is hilarious on a good day) and even the lingerie department of Lane Bryant as they stock a broad range of sizes. Very few carried special occasion bras, and none carried larger sizes. I tried David's Bridal. Nope.Then I did some Googling and learned of Contours. While I was away from Madison, some great new things definitely have happened, and Contours is one.\n\nAlthough I did have to wait a while for my personal fitting appointment (as the shop owner was with another client), the sales gal was super kind and offered us (I was shopping with the mother) water and a comfy place to sit. For a small boutique, they have a really great selection of bras and underwear in all shapes, sizes, and colors. And guess where they get most of their stock from? The UK! So, happily, my knowledge of my current bra size in UK terms made for a super easy try-on session. I walked away with a very expensive, but very perfect bra for my big day. Did I pay a little more in Contours than I might've online for the same garment? Yes. Was it worth it for the personal service and knowledge that I was supporting a local, independent business? ABSOLUTELY.\n\nI plan on going back here for other undie needs and will be sending anyone I know who mentions their need of big-busted bras!

I've been wearing B or C for as long I can remember. I questioned this, but she said that's the size I am.\n\nI tried on the 38 DD bras she brought out. ALL of them were uncomfortably tight in the ribcage. I would have much preferred a 40, but the salesperson said I\""d get used to it. I didn't want to have to get used to it. I wanted a bra that was comfortable. So I tried on all the bras and had a lovely red mark around my ribcage from twisting the bra around when I clasped it.\n\nThe DD wasn't right either. All the bras were gaping and I was swimming in the cups. The saleslady didn't seem at all interested in finding me a new size. After 12 bras, I just gave up. Their bras are expensive and I couldn't see me looking forward to wearing them.\n\nSo I went to Soma and had them fit me. I was fitted for a 40 C and bought 4 bras from them. They fit wonderfully! \n\nIt seems from the other reviews that the salespeople are really stubborn in the way they fit a person and don't listen to any suggestions from the customer.

I was immediately greeted by Mary even though she was busy, she was with me shortly.  I told her that I hadn't been fitted in a very long time and that I was probably not wearing the right bra size.  She asked if I had some time to spare, as the fittings take about half and hour.  First, she had me fill out a little Q&A deal asking me what I wanted from a bra, what I didn't like about my current bras, and so on.  After, she showed me around the store a bit and pointed out that they also sell underwear, swimsuits and other sexy things.  When we were in the dressing room, she was very helpful and informative, all while maintaining the highest level of professionalism.  She showed me some of the flaws of my current bra and then showed me a bra that actually fit me, and holy crap! What a difference!  I will be honest here, cause that's just how I roll.

That really astounded me, this whole time I've been buying bras that were way too big in the band and too small in the cup...how could I not have known?!  She brought in a TON of bras for me to try on, which NEVER happens to me...I usually consider myself lucky if I can find one.  There were a lot of really pretty embroidered ones, lots of different colors and she even brought in a few sports bras, too. After trying them on, she came back to chat with me about how to properly take care of the bras, how many days in a row you can wear the bra without compromising the elastic, and she also said that they will alter their bras for you free of charge!  The price is a bit high, but you have to consider the small investment you're making in yourself.  It's totally worth it to have a bra that fits right, looks great and is super comfortable.

The VS associates are more than happy to help you and the ever present dressing room assistants are so very helpful and great at bringing you as many as you need to find the right one, and quickly I might add.  The store was small and unimpressive.  The only unique thing was they had plates of cookies and sweets for the guests out but I was here for a bra, not to make my butt fatter.  So here at intimacy, I went in with 2 bras.  The dressing room was ok but the lighting was not as good as VS.  After trying the 1st bra, it was clearly the wrong fit so I poked my head out the door to get my \""fit expert's\"" opinion.  She was gabbing away on the phone to a friend (I could hear everything!) and ignoring me so I waited a few min and peeked out again.

So after I was about to finish, my sales girl knocks.  I open the door as she is wiping crumbs off her face lol!  Ok, I get it if you missed lunch and you gotta eat the store cookies, I understand-but please finish your snack before you resume to your duties!  Bras range from $50-high hundreds (they are all european and most seemed flimsy).  Even sports bras started at $60.  I expect much higher quality at these prices.  On the plus side they did have bathing suits with huge tops for dd's and up and offer free lifetime alterations on purchases.  \n\nI never found anything close to being what I was looking for, am unlikely to come back and left empty handed.

My mother (36E) lost weight recently, gained some back, and I'm pretty sure has never worn the proper bra size.  We walked in, were greeted promptly, and my mother went back for her fitting.  We seem to have finally gotten her properly sized (I measured her recently and got the same bra size our fitter got by eyeballing it) but the bras are so expensive, and neither of us could see that they were really twice(!) the quality of a bra at Dillard's or Macy's.  My mother liked none of their styles (what few they had).\n\nI was fitted next.  If you're on the smaller side (34C in my case)? Don't do it.  I requested bras without padding and lining--I have more than enough of those bras for several lifetimes.  The three bras my fitter brought to me?  Two had padding, one was lined and--I don't know WHO it was designed for. They were all a cup size smaller than what I usually wear.  The two padded ones, I spilled out of (I suppose that's the point, but I was straightforward: it wasn't what I wanted).  The lined one just looked terrible, and the cups were too small.  None of them flattered like the unlined bra I went in there wearing (which I purchased from an online merchant).  I can get much prettier (MUCH prettier) padded/lined bras at places like Aerie, or VS, or any department store for less than half the price (or even a quarter the price), if that's what I was in the market for.  \n\nNone of the bras we saw seemed like they were any higher quality than Wacoal, and Wacoal makes some beautiful bras--hey, also, unlined in my size that fit like a glove and flatter like crazy without making me something I'm not.  It took me damn near 34 years to learn there's nothing to be embarrassed about by a 34C, and I managed to have that stripped of me in under 10 minutes.\n\nThis store just doesn't have the kind of selection they taut.  They say they offer over 90 sizes, but I suspect they have a very limited selection in each size. . .  Or, perhaps, just a very limited selection in the smaller sizes.

My daughter wanted to by a bra that had a sign with a picture of the same bra and it said $29.99. When we went to pay the bra rang up twice the price and when we showed the sign to the clerk she took it down and said it should have been taken down a while ago and that we couldn't have that price. She then tried to say it wasn't for that bra even though it is the exact one in the picture. She said the description is for a different one that isn't the picture. That didn't even make sense. We left with nothing after being told we had to pay a different price then was clearly advertised.,0.0,0.9996328353881836

I was happy to find someone who was knowledgeable about the materials that were used to construct the bras since I had allergy issues.  The salesclerk assured me that the bras I wanted to get were free of an allergenic material and said that if I had any problems with them, I could always return and either exchange them for something else, or get my money back without hassles.\n\nThere were many sales going on at the time, and I wish I had more time to peruse through the store, but time was of the essence.

Her boutique is cozy and welcoming and cute. We sat down and talked a bit about what I needed and she got up and picked out shape wear in my perfect size without asking for my measurements or anything! This was a really great experience because last time I went to buy under things, I had a sales associate at Frederick's take me to the back of the store and say \""these are our full figured bras, they should work for you because you look a little heavy set.\"" Um. I think I'll be sticking with Love and Lace from now on!'\nAlex told me her shape wear doesn't sell well but it really should because it works better than anything I've ever had before and on top of that it's really breathable which is essential here in our Arizona summers.\nI also picked out this super adorable pink lace sports bra that I use for weight training days at the gym. It makes me super happy because now I don't have to worry about wearing ugly old tee shirts to cover my ugly old standard sports bras. If somebody sees it, it doesn't really matter!\nShe had a nice selection of lingerie which made my mouth water because I adore lingerie. That wasn't what I went in for, but I plan on going back for some at another time.\nAlex was adorable and helpful and her store seemed to reflect who she is and you can tell she has a passion for this.",1.0,0.9994413256645204

There is no ifs, ands, or buts - get your girls down here. \n\nMy mother desperately needed a bra, and I was just double-checking to make sure I had the right size for my jiggly parts. I did not. \n\nRan into a woman named Jennifer Applestein who was extremely helpful, courteous, and pleasant who measured us and even brought us bras. That's right, we stayed in the dressing room and had everything come to us. Legit. Not only that, but for my mom she made sure to run out and do a \""white t-shirt test\"" and had my mom try on a white tee with her bra to make sure everything was smooth and invisible. My mom loved the t-shirt so much that Jennifer went above and beyond and went down to the women's department to grab a bunch in different colors for my mom to try on. She ended up taking the bra Jennifer picked out as well as four of the t-shirts. My mom is not a spendy woman like I am so for her to drop that much dough in a Nordstrom's says a lot. \n\nFor me, Jennifer picked out two amazing black bras, one of which was Betsey Johnson (this woman just KNEW me!) and even offered to send an item to my home when they didn't have it in stock in the store. I declined for the time being but I was very flattered and impressed that this company does that. My mom ended up getting me the non-Betsey bra and we were both extremely satisfied with our experience. The entire store was very neat and organized, and no salesperson was pushy whatsoever. It is fast becoming my favorite department store in Las Vegas.",1.0,0.9951139092445374

I saw Soma on Yelp and figured I'd take a shot, even though there were mixed reviews.\n\nI couldn't have been more happy with the service I received.  The store was super busy on a Saturday afternoon, but Nicole was the employee who helped me out and she did an awesome job at fitting me for the correct size (totally different from what VS told me I was) and helping me find a few bras that worked for me.  \n\nThe prices aren't that bad.  You get what you pay for when it comes to bras.  They had a 2 for $59 sale when I visited, so I got two of those bras, but even not on sale, they were only $42 for a good basic tee bra in size 34D (which I LOVE by the way) and $48 for a strapless/convertible bra in 36D.  I was happy to save the $30, but would have paid full price for what I got.  I wasn't sure how the strapless one I got would work with some of my shirts/dresses, so I asked about the return policy...60 days, no questions asked.  I appreciated that, since this was my first real bra shopping experience outside of VS and I wasn't sure what would work best for me. \n\nThe only kind of negative thing I'd have to say was that the employees were chatting freely a lot about personal stuff and other employees, in front of customers.  It didn't bother me at all and I didn't think it affected their work, but I also wouldn't want my employees doing that in front of customers.",0.0,0.9870772361755372
