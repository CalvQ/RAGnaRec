That means if you open something and it's defective, you can't return it.  That's pretty crappy, especially for a store that offers some pricy items.  This is my biggest problem with the store by far.\n-They run out of a lot of stuff close to Halloween.  I went a week before Halloween and they were out of many styles of wigs and couldn't order them in time.\n-They didn't have a lot of what I was looking for.

Its fine for once in awhile b/c it does look really nice and all the ppl usually look really nice too. They have really nice and expensive private cabanas. They also have big flat screens and a beach theme (duh). Their stools are pretty uncomfortable and its hard to get a booth. I just don't want to have to get dressed up everytime I go to a bar and pay $10 for a shot. I liked going here for Halloween to see all the funny costumes.,0.0,0.8752363324165344

What I first noticed upon walking in is how large the store is. I don't know the dimensions, but it seems much larger than any other Saver's location I've visited in town. The aisles are wide, and the store is also very clean (despite how crazy busy it was when I visited). There also seemed to be more volume of clothes at this location, but once again, it could have been due to the size of the store, and the layout.\n\nThe staff at this location was very friendly, and despite the long lines, they were very level headed, helpful and friendly. With many impatient people and families shopping on a Saturday afternoon, I was not expecting this. \n\nI was there looking for Halloween supplies, and they had a lot. Right now they have a large section of the store setup for Halloween. They have both new and used costumes as well as accessories for costumes. The prices are much cheaper than Party City (where I also shopped for said supplies). The most expensive costume I saw at Saver's was $24.99, where as the comparative costume (a Pirate) was running for almost $15 more at Party City. I was there to buy masks, and was able to get a goalie mask for $1.99 where they were $4.99 for the same style mask at PC. \n\nI wish I had more time to walk around this store, as it seemed to have a lot of quality merchandise. I will have to visit again soon.",1.0,0.9542235732078552

From late September through Halloween, retail space in Windsor Square that normally sits dormant the rest of the year turns into a hauntingly ripe playground for all your needs.\n\nAs Chad E. said, the props and decorations they sell range from tame to down-right creepy (this year's demonic children are something else...).  They do try to have novel decor to purchase every year - I can't quite tell if they are catering to what's popular or defining what's going to be popular this year.  As far as costuming needs go, I have been unimpressed the past couple years.  It seems the assortment leaves much to be desired and the prices are steep.  This year, I was in search of something feudal or Renaissance in nature and found no such thing...not even a Robin Hood costume I could modify!  I did find a few things I could use to piece together my chosen costume at Party City, though.  And ladies, your only choices are \""Sexy (insert occupation).\""\n\nAll told, Spirit Halloween Store will remain part of my \""getting in the spirit\"" tradition.

Once to get a Halloween costume for my oldest, two days before Halloween, and one today to pick up some party favors.\n\nThe Halloween trip was....fun? It was crowded and annoying, but given the timeframe I didn't expect anything less. We looked at all the pictures on the wall just like everyone else and I've my daughter decided on a costume we asked one of the associates working the floor. They got it from the back quickly and we were able to try it on. The experience was relatively pain free and quick. They have a large selection and although sizes were limited, they had more than expected.\n\nToday I went to get some favors for my daughter birthday party. She wanted a Monster High theme, and after searching Pinterest I found that Party City had a lot to choose from. I went to the website first and sure enough, it looked like I would find a large selection. I was able to get some fun favors and party hats for just over $40. They also had some \""value packs\"" that would have been less.\n\nThe store is a little dirty, but it's very well organized and they have a lot of themes and characters to choose from.

Every year I have a halloween party.  I am a really good customer at Morris Costumes in this location: 4300 Monroe Rd. Charlotte, however during  my last visit I was very taken aback by the woman (older woman) that owns the store.  You have to ask to try on the wigs behind the counter, so I did and then I proceeded to put the wig on and look at it in the mirror by the dressing room. The owner came over and said to the young girl manning the booth \""Watch her\"" as I was trying on the wig in a tone as if I was going to walk off with it!!!!  First of all I am a grown woman who is a faithful shopper, probably one of their best, I have 2 kids and I am a business owner myself why on earth would she ever get the impression I was going to steal her wig is beyond me!  I would never do that and didn't give her any reason what so ever to think I would!  She said it loud and embarrassed me and made me feel like a criminal.  I said, \""don't worry I am not going to steal your wig\"" and that made her get even more of an attitude and she said \""I don't want someone like you shopping here, leave\""  OMG never in my life has something so surreal like this ever happen to me. The woman sorry to say is delusional.  Not a good vibe with friendly customer service in there, they just eagle eye you thinking the worst which is unfortunate because they had some good items but it makes you not want to give your money to such a crazy person. Although the store is big it's not the \""IT\"" store to go to for costumes, she should be careful because now a days there is a lot of competition out there with Halloween stores opening, so why be treated like that and why support her and give her your hard earned money when you can go somewhere else?  On-line, party city, halloween stores that just open space for the holiday to just name a few!  Get treated with respect when you shop!  I felt very violated.",0.0,0.996681272983551

There are no dressing rooms, so you'll have to try everything on in the aisles. Each costume normally has a set specific for you to try on, but if you need a different size and they don't have a sample in that size then you're SOL. \n\nThe customer service left something to be desired. I went in yesterday trying to get an early start on a costume for my 5 year old. I found a wonderful costume online, but I'm often nervous about making online clothing purchases and not knowing if it'll be a proper fit, so I thought I'd see if they had it. I was immediately greeted by a man who asked if there was anything he could help me find. I told him about the costume and even showed him a picture. He said he'd check their computer and made a point of telling me that he'd find me in the store if I left the aisle I was in. I continued looking around, but after 20 mins...He didn't return.\n\nI picked up a small mask that caught my child's eye and made my way to the register. The man was there along with SIX others, buy none of them said a single word to me. I awkwardly looked about me to ensure I was standing within the roped area that signals a customer is ready to purchase and still none of them asked to assist me. Finally, one of the pudgier guys who had walked back and forth behind the counter and made eye contact with me twice before...looked at me again and without saying anything just waved his hand to motion me forward as he rolled his eyes. I get to his register and he says \""I'll help you.\"" There was no mistaking his unpleasant attitude. \n\nMost of the costumes here can be found elsewhere and much, much cheaper. I went to Party City before going here and Halloween Mart is selling the same exact Queen of Hearts costume for $40.00 more than Party City. \n\nIf it's not Halloween and you absolutely need a costume and cannot wait to have it shipped from online then, ok...you can go here as a last resort. It might be a better idea to try the costume on here and buy it online as Halloween Marr isover priced and the staff is rude.",0.0,0.9979092478752136
