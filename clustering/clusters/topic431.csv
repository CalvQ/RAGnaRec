Very exciting, and I have already been twice: once on opening night (free cheap champagne and fabulous people watching, like all of Scottsdale's bad plastic surgery in one place) and once this morning.\n\nThis store's layout is supposed to be modeled after one's own closet, which is laughable because if my own closet looked like that I wouldn't be shopping at BR. It's a bunch of little rooms based on \""looks\"" - work, casual, etc. That's OK, I guess, but it makes the whole shopping experience somewhat disjointed. I was hoping that they would be carrying a bigger variety of items, but if anything, it's even less than the old store - kind of a bummer. \n\nIt was nice to see that the store was well stocked, and that even after opening day hubbub in our anorexic town, there were smalls and extra-smalls in everything that I wanted to try on. The staff is extremely helpful and responsive, despite the chaos. The fitting rooms are huge, beautifully decorated, and very flatteringly lit. They had wicked deals this weekend - get a $25 card for every $100 you spend - that's pretty good. \n\nSo yeah... big brouhaha for the new store, but really?

Other brands in the same section include Warehouse, Oasis, Kookai, and the reliably decent Mango. One floor up you've got perfume and cosmetics, stationery, a small amount of jewellery, handbags, and a newly opened Caffe Nero. The perfume and cosmetics are pretty organised, but the rest is a bit of a random hodge-podge.

I was only able to help my mom pick out a door knob for our bathroom, so I would say it was successful. \n\nIf you are a woman or young girl Hipster, I am sure you would love this store.  It is a little pricey, though.",1.0,0.9987503290176392

It's much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.  The merchandise is pretty decent but like most thrift stores these days it is a little on the high side. Things are organized and clean except when people allow their kids to wreak havoc making a mess, breaking things, ripping open bags and losing the pieces to games and toys.\n\nI finally spoke to a clerk about it last time I was there.  \nMe: Who wants to be the \""Crabby Old Lady of the Day??\""\n\nMe: ME!!! (Raises hand high!)\n\nThen I proceeded to let them know, nicely,  that it was unsafe for all those toys etc to be strewn over the aisles where a nice old person who was a real customer was trying to walk. And that they are losing money on the broken and lost items. They were totally sympathetic and let it be known they agreed with me but couldn't do much about it due to liability or fear of being sued or whatever.  \n\nHowever, the employee went over and spoke to the kids in Spanish and resolved the problem.  Hopefully he was telling them that the Bruja over there was going to come eat their eyeballs out at night while they were sleeping if they didn't cut it out.\n\n\n If I can ever remember to go on a Wednesday, that's Senior Day, 50% off.  They have different color tags on sale every day and certain catagories, like 30% off kids clothes on Thursdays.  I haven't gotten into the habit of going often enough to memorize these.",0.0,0.990047574043274

The security guards were a little bit intimidating, staring at you and looking bored out of their minds.  In other nice stores at caesars, they at least smile or say have a good nite.  Anyway, like Fern mentioned, the purse bar was kind of interesting and fun.  Once the associate found out my aunt might get something, she pulled out 7-10 bags for us to see and took off the protection tape on each.  I forgot her name, but she was very patient and very helpful.  She disappeared for a long while after we decided, but I would still recommend it if you are seriously looking, and even though they would probably ignore me if I was by myself!",1.0,0.980993628501892

(I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. \n\nMy friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, \""That one is $1400.\"" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says \""Okay,\"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!\n\nNothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? \n\nFor the hard-working middle class schmo and \""normal\"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip.",0.0,0.9396209716796876

The \""discounts\"" on framing, however, seem to be a permanent thing -- don't get swept away just because they're offering 70% off.  It's always 60-70% off.",0.0,0.9957701563835144
