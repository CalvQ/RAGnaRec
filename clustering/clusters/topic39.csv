They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.\n\nWe kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake.

I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \""pork\"" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards.",0.0,0.9951125979423524

In fact, don't come here at all. God forbid you get all butt hurt b/c someone said f*ck in public. We wouldn't want your meal to be ruined.

Apparently I would write on Yelp about though.  =9 It was alright.  A little bit on the expensive side.\n\nOverall the meal was decent.  They had HUGE signs of Live Crawfish posted everywhere and when we asked they said they didn't have it.  They really should have taken the banner and signs down.  Would I come back here?  Nahhhh...

Good thing we're not picky eaters, plus we were on a time crunch so we were more interested in eating and going.  Our food came with a good amount of meat so it turned out to be very filling.

I guess you can say it doesn't sound very nice to say, but the food here is my favorite Vietnamese cuisine. I'm not a huge fan of the pho but I'm a very big fan of their vermicelli noodle bowls! It's the perfect amount of food for someone with a middle sized appetite. They're open late night so if you're out on the strip with your friends or are looking for a late night snack (hardly the size for a snack), Mr. Pho Kim Long is your best bet to satisfy your Vietnamese craving.\n\nThe service isn't super because of the lack of personality their staff has but they bring your food out fairly quick. Does one base service on how quick you get to eat or how pleasant they make your visit? I say it depends on both but lucky for Pho Kim Long, their service is very fast and consistent.  It wouldn't hurt the staff to crack a smile or two, crack a joke, or laugh even. They don't have a problem splitting your checks as long as they get their money.  The atmosphere is very traditionally Asian and being of Asian descent, it doesn't do much for me.  In other words, you wont catch me with my iPhone in hand snapping shots like some tourist or something. Maybe, the food for Yelp but that's all ;)\n\nNever had a problem customer service-wise, always accommodated the big groups of friends I go everywhere with, and doesn't take log to bring what you ask for. That's a big thing for me when the server takes the detour to bring you something you've asked for. And having to ask for it twice really peeves me but as busy and as impersonable as their staff is, they go and get what you ask for right away. Maybe to get you to go faster? If I wanted to be In -n- Out of a joint, I'd go get a burger! Hahaha! Go for the pork vermicelli, add the sauce they give you with some of the oyster (brown) sauce and a bit of the hot sauce and you'll be good!

Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.\n\nPho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.\n\nWhen I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.\n\nDuring my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more \""true\"" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.\n\nHowever, here's the issue:\n\nNOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.\n\nSo...... basically......\n\nEat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want.

The last couple of days we had hiked the grand canyon, along with camping out so we were kinda tired of American food. After stopping at the Rio Seafood buffet the night before we were up for a change. \n\nGood pho in vegas?  No way, but i figured my Vietnamese friends would know better than me. I'll go ahead and separate my review into two parts,  the food and service. \n\nFood,  the pho was just ok. I got the Pho bo vien which is the Pho with meatballs. I thought the soup was a little bland for me. The portion size was decent and I got a lot of meat in mine, which is good. The price was a little higher than what I'm used to, but its Vegas, not So Cal, so not too bad I guess.The question I asked myself was, would I come to this place if it was located in So Cal. The question is probably not. The food was very average, nothing made it stand out. \n\nNow on to the service, The order came out pretty quick which i liked, however thats where the service got interesting. We had to ask for napkins, seriously what restaurant doesn't give you napkins to start off ? Someone in our group ordered the rice with pork chop, looked good, but we had to ask 4 or 5 times for a knife. Overall the service was pretty bad, and this is with asian people. \n\nI was told that with Vietnamese places, the ideal is to get good food out fast and not care about service.

The service was good; my drink stayed full.  I really enjoyed the decor.  There were at least two large fish tanks that looked very clean and housed gigantic, interesting looking fish.  The place has a distinctly Asian feel that isn't done justice by its strip mall exterior.  I don't have other Vietnamese restaurants to compare it to (yet) but I would happily make another dinner trip to Saigon Palace.",1.0,0.996292233467102

I'm happy to say that our food was pretty much on par with VG, and my boyfriend actually preferred his pho at SP.  We got almost exactly the same thing that we did at Vietnam Grille so we could compare: he got pho with brisket and steak, and I got bun with chicken and a spring roll.  We started the meal with fresh spring rolls wrapped in rice paper and served with peanut sauce--it wasn't my favorite and I probably wouldn't get them again.  But when the entrees came out--watch out!  The pho had cilantro, which I missed from VG, and the meat was done perfectly.  Only one fatty piece, which is pretty good.  I loved my bun even more, which had a lot of chicken (more than VG), well seasoned and tasty, and the sauce that came with it (mirin with some other things) we mixed with hoisin and soy, and it was delicious.

Having never been, I checked out the buffet, which had a great selection, I was a little overwhelmed and asked to order from the menu. Maybe not the right choice since the menu was 7+ pages long, with very little descriptions.  I started with the spring rolls & peanut sauce, and the egg drop soup, both very good. I then ordered the shrimp with vegetables and fried rice. The portions were very large, which I enjoyed for dinner, but both good.  I will say the fried rice was the BEST I have found in Charlotte!\nAs for the three, here goes.  Although the food was good, I was disappointed with the overall service.  There are plenty of waiters there to attend to you, however, there isn't one specifically assigned to your table so there are different people bringing the water, meal, receipt, etc. which turned out to be a mess. And, without knowing how the restaurant works I felt a little out of place.  I will say that I will definitely go back and try the buffet as that seemed to be the thing to do among most of the other patrons.\nOverall I enjoyed the meal and would recommend this spot for vietnamese and pho lovers.",1.0,0.8579573631286621

I grew up cooking and eating Vietnamese food, savoring with all possible senses what every dish entails. Vietnamese cuisine is all about the fresh herbs and vegetables. It doesn't matter if you're making a spring roll to the infamous pho soup broth, there are so many ingredients to titillate your palate. Personally, I think that is what Saigon Palace lacks. I am never guaranteed that my cravings will be fulfilled upon entering and that's quite a let down for any foodie. I do admit that when they are on their game, the food is great! Personally, I don't want to risk the hit or miss wager.\n\nIf you're new to Vietnamese cuisine and would like an ample selection to sample, I would recommend their Sunday buffet. As Sunday brunch, Saigon Palace serves a good variety of classic Vietnamese dishes such as banh xeo (Vietnamese crepes), grilled quail, various soups (banh canh, curry, bo kho, congee, etc) and desserts. I believe it is only on Sunday, $16 and only lasts til 4. If you're having a hard time figuring out what sauce goes with what dish or what herbs should be eaten to best complement a dish, feel free to ask an employee to help. I'm sure they would gladly lend the knowledge. \n\nEven though Saigon Palace does not meet my high standards, overall I do think it is a good family- owned Vietnamese restaurant. The restaurant is clean and filled with friendly staff. The owner will often roam through to make sure everything is to your satisfaction, which is always great. The menu has a vast variety of choices and the portions are always huge.",1.0,0.9961937665939332

The pho was okay, it was not the best Pho I've had, and I think it was below par for the midwest as a whole.  I'm starting to think though that Madison simply doesn't have the Asian food thing going...so by Madison standards this place might be a little better.\n\nThe fresh rolls were not very good.  They were just rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp, and lettuce.  There was no cilantro or mint, nor any other fresh herbs--which I think is a key ingredient.  Without fresh green herbs, the fresh rolls have little flavor.  I also think the noodles used in the rolls were too big, and there was too much meat.  And the meat (both the shrimp and pork) had been cooked in a sauce that was too sweet.  This made the rolls come across as heavy, starchy, and bland.\n\nThe pho was mediocre.  I've had worse, but I'd say this is in the lower quartile of pho quality I've encountered.  The broth was heavy on the cinnamon, lacked complexity, and tasted too sweet (possibly because of too much cinnamon).\n\nOn the side I was given bean sprouts, lime, and hot pepper, but no cilantro and no basil...which in my opinion is essential.  Again, the experience was disappointing.\n\nI could be convinced to come back to this place.  It is possible that the chefs aren't Vietnamese and just don't know how to make this type of food well.  But if I came back, I would order something different.  And as it is, this place gets two stars.  I'm no culinary genius, but the mistakes / omissions this place made were VERY basic.

It's worth the 4 stars, but a lot of the traditional things that you'd expect from a regular restaurant you can't from this place.\n\nFirst off, it's been here forever. I've been coming here since I've been like 12. It is, IMO, one of the BEST Vietnamese restaurants here in Phoenix. Like all good Vietnamese restaurants, it is in the hood. It is also old, and grungy, and the service is not always on point. (I actually find that the service is usually better than some other Asian places. Some in Cali are truly AWFUL.) It is, in my opinion, usually brisk, to the point, and gets things done. I don't often have to wait for my water to be filled or feel like I've been ignored when it comes to being seated. But they're not smiling at you making conversation about how your mani-pedi just went. This isn't that kind of place. Same with the facilities. It's not disgusting. The bathrooms are clean and dry, there's always tons of TP and soap and it doesn't smell. But there are cleaner, newer places around. If that icks you out, go find one of those nice new Pho places in Scottsdale. This place isn't for you.\n\nThe food is, in general, outstanding. It's got one of the best ranges of Vietnamese food that I've seen. Most places just serve Pho, and that's it. But they have amazing beef stew, bun rieu, banh mi... I checked out their banh xeo here after my vietmanese coworker said that's his favorite thing, and it's the best I've had so far. So crispy it shatters, with tons of flavor in the dip and great toppings. My husband always has to take away their liver spread banh mi after we've come here. Their spring rolls are fresh. And it's all cheap. We can get an appetizer, drinks, dessert, noodles, and banh mi to go for $35, including tax and tip. The only dud for me was the bun bo hue. Bland and disappointing, there are places that make it better. \n\nAnd the proof is in the pudding. This place is almost always busy. I get my food quickly, it's hot and good, and you get taken care of well. If that's all you need, then this is your place for Vietnamese food.

I will start with the service.  3 people--3 entrees ordered.  The Pho came out 25 minutes after ordering,  the next dish came 25 minutes after the PHO and the third dish.....well..... we wondered about since it was NOT arriving.  We actually thought they had forgotten about the third dish. Embarrassingly, the third dish was for the out of town guest who wanted to try Vietnamese food.  So to sum it up, the service gets rounded up to  \""zero\"" stars.  How can you serve 3 entrees in the course of an hour and 20 minutes to the same table and have each customer eating their food alone while the others watch?  It is called \""dining\""  not eating because the act is part of a larger social experience.  If I wanted to \""eat\"" I would have bought a gyro and eaten it in my car.  So, definitely a big zero for service.\nNow for the food.  The chicken PHO was mediocre at best.  Hubby said that on a scale of 1-10, it was a 4.  He named 6 other vietnamese restaurants who do it better including the PHO place in the Gila River Casino in Chandler.  Really Da Vang?  You allow yourself to be beat out on PHO by a casino food court outfit?  Shame on you. Pho's should be your go-to dish!   Next:\nStir fried noodles with pork & shrimp.  Way below par.  Had to add Siracha sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce to get any taste out of it.  And the pork  appeared to be scraps of pork (not pieces) cut lengthwise and very thin; and by the way Da Vang, thanks for the 3 small (and I mean small) shrimp you added to the dish.  Never, never, never, never, EVER---that's what my stomach is saying about me even thinking about ordering this dish EVER again.  Next:\nSauteed beef with lemongrass over rice.  This was the definite winner of the three with a score of 5 out of ten.  The beef was not trimmed and fat prevailed.  Now, I know that fat is where it's at in terms of flavor but enough is enough.  Again, fish sauce and soy sauce had to be added to make it palatable.  AND FINALLY:\nThe spring rolls ordered with Tofu instead of shrimp and pork were good and a good value.  Other than that... Not too much to be said for Da Vang.  Between the service and the less than stellar food,  I won't be there any time soon.....  Wait......wait....., wait a minute, I hear something.........  It's my stomach ....saying NO WAY JOSE....   I guess I won't  be going back ever again.  Stomach rules!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9990309476852416

The dac biet here was seriously lacking in ingredients and portion size.  I finished my bowl in no time and I did not leave full.  This is the first time a bowl of pho did not fill me up.

There were much less noodles and no tripe in the soup.  Also, instead of giving us limes to eat with the pho, they gave us *lemons* - another first.

It makes it much easier for newcomers to swallow when they can see what they're ordering is going to look like, especially with such a lengthy list of dishes whose descriptions otherwise would probably not do them justice. Plus, Vietnamese food can be intimidating to noobs, and they have their entire menu online, so you can prep your friends before you take them.\n\nThe sandwiches are great, as should be expected. At around $4 a piece, it's a little higher than I'm used to, but the rest of the menu is comparably priced. I prefer the special combination, but I'm partial to pate and all things related to organ meat. The chicken salad stands out, as does the BBQ. They're all very good.\n\nThe gem of a dish from this place, in my opinion, is the pho dac biet. I've eaten this at probably 20 different restaurants, and this is by far the best I've had. The thinly sliced beef is, as a rule, quite chewy in this dish, and Hue Thai's version is the exception that proves it. It was incredibly tender. They also have beef tendon in theirs, which I've never had before.\n\nThe one thing I hate about this place is the horrible top 40 satellite radio station they play. Horrible. But, I'm still willing to tolerate it for the great food.\n\nThere is a huge selection of beverages here also. I'm usually a plain hot tea drinker, so most don't appeal to me, but one has the option of probably 30 or 40 different drinks. The obligatory durian shake is present if you're adventurous, or you could elect to get one made with jack fruit, if you're feeling a little less so.

And even though most non-Vietnamese will order the combination sandwich, I urge you to try the egg banh mi.  The eggs are cooked sunny-side-up and a tad runny.

I may like the local dive, but.... you'd best smile at me.  Either way, I perused. Spring roll - check. Grilled pork and egg roll on vermicelli - check. \nWell. The spring roll LOOKED good, but upon closer inspection, it was clear that it wasn't made just then.  The shrimp was cut very thin, and the pork in it was very dry.  Hmph. Then the vermicelli came. Now, before I describe this, the price on this dish was not high. $7 and change I believe, however, I would have preferred to pay an extra dollar and get better quality. The pork, though the taste was delish, was sparse and very grisselly (is that a word?). The eggrolls were ok, but some of the meat (pork) inside appeared to be pink, which I interpreted as not fully cooked. Eeek. Uncooked pork??  I took those out. The sauce was yummy, and the veggies (cucumber and carrots) were cut larger than I'm used to in this dish.  \nI'll give this place one more try another time, but at this point, it looks like I'll still be making the trek to Chinatown for my authentic Vietnamese.",0.0,0.9979494214057922

It really is sad to see such a place fail...when it could actually be something good.  Not only do the ratings here on yelp speak for it self...but take a visit...the place is practically empty even on peak hours.

They have the best Vietnamese food that I've found in the valley, and I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the heavily Asian part of Chandler (Cyclo, Pho Van, Anise, etc.).  The pho here is absolutely terrific and is really packed full of flavor.  The other dishes I've tried have also all been fantastic, and everyone I've taken here has absolutely loved it.  Seriously, nobody has had a bad dish or a bad experience.  The staff is extremely friendly and if you have questions about anything, they'll spend as much time as you need helping you out, even though it might be in slightly broken English.  Add on to all of this that you can get a huge bowl of pho for $7 and there's really nothing bad that can be said about this place.\n\nGuess what else?  They have boba tea.  I was concerned that when I was living in North Phoenix for a few weeks I wouldn't be able to get boba tea as easily as I could in Chandler, but Pho Avina once again saves the day.  Their boba is a little bit softer than I prefer, but it's still good and definitely worth getting.\n\nFinally, if you're feeling really adventurous, Pho Avina has both durian boba tea and durian ice cream.  I haven't checked, but they may even be able to bring you a small plate of durian if you ask nicely.  For those who don't know, durian is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and is known for having one of the most foul odors of anything in the world.  Durians smell so bad that some Asian countries have banned them from subways and other public places, similar to smoking bans.  People either love them or hate them - I personally think durian tastes like a mix of rotten onions and garlic, so I'm not a big fan.  A friend of mine thinks they taste like a mix of feet and death and actually instantly threw up the first time he bit into a piece of the fruit.  Still though, some people absolutely love durian, and it's definitely something worth trying once in your life.\n\nThis place has it all, and although I'm moving out of Phoenix in just a few days, I'm going to make damn sure that I visit Pho Avina every time I come back.",1.0,0.9987369179725648

Now Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for their service but this place was amazingly bad. Our server never once asked us if we wanted refills, and it took nearly a half an hour to get our Pho. For those not in the know, Pho is extremely easy to make once you have the broth. It should only take 10 minutes or so to have this ready, TOPS. \n\nIf you think I'm off my rocker do yourself a favor and visit one of these:\nKhai Hoan (the best), Da Vang (really good), and Cyclo (kind of over rated, but this place puts Dragonfly to shame ).",0.0,0.9917282462120056

I put in a simple order of Chicken fried rice to go then she walked away leaving me in the middle of the restaurant so I went and had a seat at the front door.  This place isn't to well organized for walking in and ordering food to go.  So I waited about ten minutes and then went out to my car for maybe 5 minutes and when I came back in I saw a to-go box sitting near the hostess counter which I assumed was my order... after waiting another 10 minutes or so the waitress (who wasn't busy) came over and asked me to pay, which I did... then she handed me my cold food.  Waiting approximately 30 minutes for an $11 order of chicken fried rice was kinda shitty considering there were only a total of 4 customers in the entire restaurant.  When I got home to eat my food I wasn't very impressed with the portion size for the money and the food was so bland to top it off!  There wasn't much of anything I could do to doctor it up so I reheated my cold flavorless meal and ate as is.  NOT IMPRESSED\n\nFYI, the best place for Vietnamese food in my opinion is Noodles Ranch located @ the SE Corner of Thomas & Scottsdale road in Scottsdale.  Their food is to die for!

Instead I smelled salt. This was troubling. After tasting the broth I immediately knew what I was smelling and now tasting, beef bouillon. There was a very subtle flavor almost like watered down  Pho. The taste and flavor of the bouillon lingered on my tongue and left and and odd feeling in my mouth. This was probably the saddest excuse for Pho I have ever had. Real Pho requires a missive amount of bones and spices to create the broth that soothes the soul. Now onto my husband, order the charbroiled pork Bun, his vegetables were mushy the pork was not anywhere on par with other places we've been.

I was skeptical since so many people are uneducated on the cuisine, the restaurant's website did not list many dishes that I enjoy, and there was much english spoken on the menu. Even their Bun Bo Hue required a special order of pig blood, and there was no mention of pate or ham hock. I chalked it up to an American place to get Pho, which is to Vietnamese as Spaghetti is to Italian. I mean, most American's eat it because it is \""safe\"" and their brains are comfortable with it. \n\nWhatever, I tried it anyway. This place blew my mind! I ended up ordering a \""safe\"" dish because that is all they had on the menu and it really wowed me. Bun Bi Cha Gio, which is something that I actually eat quite frequently was so high in quality and so different from what I am used to. The pork tasted so well seasoned and was very interesting, bean sprouts were amazingly fresh and plentiful, cucumbers and lettuce were crisp and delightful. Overall, the bowl was as if someone had hand picked the veggies and taken them directly from the garden to the bowl. The nuoc mam was a little disappointing after seeing the amazing quality of everything else, it was still very nice but not as flavorful as I prefer. When I make my own I use a Thai Chili in each batch, so I'm just used to a little spicier. \n\nSomething here that is not so typical of a Vietnamese restaurant is the relative fanciness of it. They have done a nice job of making this a warm and inviting enviroment without it resulting in crazy high prices, such as you'll find at Cyclo. I was thrilled with the service, as it was the first time in ANY Vietnamese restaurant that I received a refill on my water without asking for it, and I've eaten Vietnamese for a LONG time. \n\nOverall, I can't give Pho Ao Sen five stars because the menu does not have all the great dishes that is indicative of the cuisine and favors to the safe bets for Americans. I understand their target audience and who lives in the neighborhood, but I wish they would not sell themselves short and stay true to their roots.

Stuffed Calamari: fresh squid stuffed with minced glass noodle, shrimp, and ground pork and then deep fried.  This dish is time-consuming to make and doesn't yield too much profit (which explains why I've mainly had it home-made) but completely yummy.\n\n2.

It sounds simple and it is: tuna filets are fried and then topped with crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Simplicity in peasant food is usually what makes it so emotional.\n\n3.  Lotus Salad: usually seen at parties, a rare exception (we don't have too many salads) in Vietnamese cuisine that works.  Thin pieces of lotus stems are mixed with jicama, pork, shrimp, and mint, then topped with roasted peanuts and served with tamarind fish sauce.

When we did finally go out we realized that ALL Vietnamese restaurants in the area close at 9pm as opposed to Chinese places which stay open till 2 or 3 AM.  Why is that anyway? So we felt rushed to find a place quickly.  We chose Pho Cali thinking it looked competent and clean.  As we sat down we encountered the dreaded Surly Waiter.  Apparently someone whizzed in this guys cornflakes today and he was taking it out on us! He thrust the menus at us without a word with a thoroughly disgusted look on his face.  My husband nicely asked if he spoke English. He replied sarcastically \""No, Spanish\"". Imagine his surprise when hubby proceeded to order our entire meal in Spanish.  Suddenly pissed off waiter boy spoke English!  The rest of the meal was a constant parry of attitude and sarcasm.  What school of serving did this guy attend?  I didn't check Yelp before going to this purveyor of fine Vietnamese cuisine so I guess I had it coming.  Our experience pretty much paralleled other Yelpers regarding paying the bill.  He added it up then when we tried to pay with American dollars padded the bill due to the exchange rate.  Would not accept our credit card either.  We payed cash and left this fine example of waitstaff one shiny Canadian dollar for the privilege of having him serve us and left.  Suddenly Nasty waiter follows us out to the street and proceeds to pull an indignant Justin Long tirade from \""Waiting\""!!! Oh, HELL NO!  He says \""here sir you left your money on the table\"". In perfect English no less!  I said before he could go any further\"" oh no you earned every penny of that with your fine attitude\"" he got all \""Guppy\"" on me opening and closing his mouth and nothing coming out.  So aside from the terrible service the Pho was decent, the limeade tangy and tasty and the rolls we had were excellent.  Not good enough to justify putting up with such nasty waitstaff. There must be much better Vietnamese places around.  I would avoid this one.  Just sayin....",0.0,0.998153269290924

Boyfriend's parents knew the owner, they were friendly and started bantering with us. (Too bad I can't understand anything) Deciding to be adventurous, I ordered bo kho for the first time. they came over with small pho soup (compliments of the house) first, what deliciousness, the light and clear soup with beef balls, the soup flavor is perfect, every spice, seasoning, herb and the bo soup base is on the dot. Then my bo kho came (with rice). How come I never ordered this dish before?! The flavor is incredible, the meat taste heavenly, mixed with beef tendons, skins and fatty meat, giving the extra tenderness and texture. The stew itself is brewed to the perfect flavor, PERFECT, there is no saltiness, heaviness, just the perfect blend of flavors dominating all of my taste buds. From the first moment, my taste buds started slaving away for the delishness of the food and entered a foodie trance. We had che 3 mau for dessert, the gelatin sugar, green jelly and beans, along with coconut milk (lactose free!), so refreshing, so delicious, so good.\n\nI'm in love with this place and with its bo kho.

Finally, I'm happy I've had the chance to go eat at Paris Pho.\n\nFrom the exterior it doesn't look like much, nor does it impress when any when you walk in. The staff doesn't necessary try to cater to your needs other than the hush rush type of efficient service to get you to your grub quickly. We walked in and got immediately seated without a word. Warm tea was served to us within the minute. \n\nLooking around, I could tell that this place was pretty popular and a lot of action was going on during lunch. I assume the Bombardier employees love coming here as their building is 2 minutes walking distance. We got our menus along with pen and paper where the practice of \""write your own order\"" is expected.\n\nWe went with the lunch special #46, which consisted of some chicken and beef along with a serving of a salad, spring roll and rice. We got our plates within 10 minutes. Talk about fast.\n\nThe chicken was tasty, the beef was better. The egg roll and sauce was just right. The rice and salad were in generous portions and all in all, this meal fit the bill. The warm tea washed it all down nicely.\n\nThe price tag is very reasonable, with the lunch costing me a mere $11.\n\nI would have given Paris Pho 5 stars but the service could have been a little better and the tea pot's snout was broken which caused tea to leak on the table whenever we tried poring it. No deal-breakers but worth mentioning.\n\nWould come again.",0.0,0.9499096274375916

It was horrible. The pork bits, and I normally LOVE pig meat, looked like little turds floating in a bouillon that tasted like soapy dirty dish water. After 2 spoonfuls I was DONE with that soup.\n\nI had the beef and chicken combo, I went for safe stuff, but then these utilitarian restaurants never offer much more than this. The chicken was dry and crunchy. The beef was a really cheap cut and tasted boiled more than it did grilled. The noodles, well I tasted Ramen noodles in my student days that tasted better than this. And the whole dish needed to be sandstormed with salt to give just a little taste.\n\nThe only thing that tasted like anything was the spring roll which was plural on the menu, I was wondering where the second one was.

I love bananas and then the idea of deep frying them and dipping them in syrup, well that's just awesome but I digress. I ordered the Fried Bananas anyway and that also was a mistake. They tasted pre-fab out of a box and the syrup was made with Maple Syrup.

We were first disappointed by the slightly higher price point as compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, but most of the time, as long as it tastes extra good, price can be overlooked in my book.\n\nWhat we shared for lunch\n1.  Nem Nuong Cuon - Spring rolls with a vietnamese sausage.  I enjoyed the flavor of the nem nuong + the extra BONUS of the crispy deep fried dough in there.  The dipping sauce that came with was reminiscent of Brodard's in Westminster.  It was definitely not hoisin sauce heavy, but it had its own refreshing sweet appeal.\n2.  Bun Bo Hue - This was in LARGE print right as you opened the menu, so we figured that it was a sign to try it.  We were not disappointed.  I would have to say one of the better bun bo hue's in town and we were very impressed with the appropriate accompaniments of veggies - finely shredded various cabbages and herbs like freshly chopped rau ram (Vietnamese coriander)\n\nConclusion:  Minus puntos for being more expensive than other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.  Minus puntos for being slightly stuffy and hot for a Las Vegas summer.  (Sorry for the next person who has to sit in my sweatiness....ew...sorry bad imagery.)  Plus puntos for having very tasty Bun Bo Hue with the fragrant veggie accompaniments and crunchy bonus in our nem nuong cuon.  Also, it can't hurt to have a fob-a-licious clever restaurant name.

We ordered to go and he even brought out water with lemons for us without even asking. The menu is pretty small. They don't have much variety. Rather, it looks like their focus is on the core staples at Vietnamese restaurants. I didn't eat pho, but had a rice dish instead. I will have to return another time for dinner to try our their pho and provide an update. \n\nThe com tam dac biet (combination) is pricey at $10.50, but fairly cheap in comparison to Charlotte's standards (sorry to beat the dead horse, but when you are used to paying an average of $4.75 for the same dish back in Ca, it's hard not to gripe about it). On the flip side though, Saigon Palace charges $13.95 for the same dish, but their com tam dac biet also comes with a few items Vietnam Grille is missing. \n\nThe Egg rolls here are different, smaller and with a rice paper style wrapper. It also lacks the traditional dac biet items, a pork chop, a sunny side egg (can be ordered on top) and most importantly, the shredded pork. The shredded pork is one of my favorite items in this dish and I'm sad to report that this restaurant doesn't offer it. Shrimp was grilled perfectly, as most places usually overcook shrimp. Ironically, I prefer my shrimp overcooked, lol. One thing I do especially like here are their meatballs. They appear homemade and formed in an unorthadox sphere shape. They look more like sausages. The grilled chicken was also flavorful. \n\nOverall, it was a good meal. Service was quick and friendly. The owner even asked if I ever had their pho. When I said no and he suggested that I must try it. From the reviews of this place, I'm sure its good. And besides, who can turn down an invitation from a restaurant owner/chef? Since it's somwehat new, he makes an effort to know his customers. That might change if business picks up; but either way, it works and I like it.\n\nBased on the com tam, this isn't the best Vietnamese restaurant around town, but its definitely a force to be reckoned with.

Perhaps we didn't choose the best dishes, but the tom rang muoi tasted quite bland with the salt/pepper mixture being nonexistent. There was also very little heat with the jalepenos provided.  Also, in my experience, tom rang muoi is traditionally prepared with the shells still being on the shrimp in order to keep more seasoning on and in the shrimp as it's being fried.

Pho is the \""it\"" Vietnamese dish.  I love pho.  When I think of pho I expect something good and fulfilling without breaking your wallet.  It's been a while since my first and last visit to Vietnam's Pho but I clearly remember that the service was poor.  There were two people working at the bar when my friend, boyfriend and I stopped in for some pho.  I really don't understand why they have that big bar anyway.  It didn't seem like anyone was there.  It took forever to get someone's attention when we wanted order or when we needed a fork and spoon (my European friend had never used chopsticks before).  Also, whenever the server came around, he would glare at us as if we were bothering him from watching television.  Bad service aside, the pho was sub-par.  The bowl was big with a lot of rice noodle, but there was nothing really special about the pho.  It's true that a bowl of pho should be plentiful, but just having a lot of noodle alone is not enough to make it good.  Pho, though it seems simple is hard to get right on taste since the broth requires long hours of cooking and using the right combination of spices.  In addition, you need to have the right herbs/toppings and condiments.  I guess overall, it wasn't horrible, but there was nothing special about the place or the food.  Maybe my expectations are too high for pho here, but I won't be returning to this place any time soon.  I've been to several Vietnamese places in Pittsburgh, and I've definitely eaten worse pho elsewhere. In general I prefer Pho Minh in Bloomfield since (even though their pho isn't really worth raving about) their Vietnamese dishes are pretty good considering we're in Pittsburgh and the service is much better.",0.0,0.9899134635925292

Generally, I'm not looking for 5 star service when I go to a pho place.  But this place made the other over 50 different pho places I've been to in my life look like 5 star restaurants.  No one greets you here or tells you there will be a wait.  There were at least 10 people waiting by the door and there were at least 4 different servers who saw all the people by the door and said nothing to them. \n\nI come from a Vietnamese background, I grew up in a Vietnamese neighborhood, my parents and family friends make some of the best Viet food around, I cook Viet food, and I've had Vietnamese food all over Vietnam.  So I'd say I'm pretty seasoned when it comes to the proper flavor profiles and textures.  \n\nHad the spring rolls (25 min after I ordered them).  They grasped the general idea but they were mediocre at best...the rolls weren't rolled tightly enough, there were too many rice noodles, not enough greens, and the shrimp/meat inside def could've been fresher.  Also, the dipping sauce wasn't complete since they didn't give any do chua (pickled daikon/carrots).  I've been spoiled with really good spring rolls my whole life.  I can't say I'd order these again.\n\nPho is a quick dish to serve...it's already prepared (although it takes hours to actually make), so in theory, you should have a piping hot bowl in front of you within 5-10 min of ordering.  The pho didn't come til 20 min after the spring rolls.  That's a full and unreasonable 45 min of wait time from ordering til it was in front of me.  I'll admit that they give you a lot of meat and noodles, which I loved.  The flavor profiles were the right context. but it def lacked depth.  Felt like it was missing something..not enough fish sauce or star anise? Not sure...\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed..but I wasn't expecting much in the first place.  Sucks that it didn't live up to any expectations I had because I really wanted to love it.  I guess it would do if I had a dire Viet craving and was waaaay too lazy to cook.",0.0,0.9986293315887452

I do love most ethnic food I try and I'd been wanting to try Vietnamese for a while. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant I noticed it had that same hole-in-the-wall neighborhood ethnic food atmosphere. Nothing fancy. We were seated immediately. After reading the menu about 50 times I asked our server what he suggested for someone who'd never had Vietnamese food before. He suggested #9 the Pho Tai (beef eye round noodle soup).  \n\nWe ordered the quail to start and it was delicious. The spices on it were just right and the skin was crisp and had a sweet caramelized bbq flavor. Of course since it was quail the portion was tiny, but the flavor and moistness were perfect. \n\nWhen I got my pho I struggled to eat it with chopsticks. An art I still haven't mastered. Forks were not provided and I didn't want to be rude and ask for one so I just dealt. \n\nThe broth was okay. It seemed sort of bland, even after I added quite a bit of torn fresh basil leaves and a squirt of lime. I also added sprouts, but that was all that came standard with this dish. I was hoping for a wider variety of veggies to add, there weren't any onions or chili peppers which I think would have helped. About halfway through the dish I ended up adding some hoisin sauce to give it more depth, but it only helped marginally. The portion size was good, though the amount of beef in the bowl was lacking. It had probably about 6 pieces the size of a quarter each. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered #29 com suon-bi-cha which was a grilled pork chip, \""shredded\"" (more like small chunks) pork cook in a glaze, rice and a fried egg (even though it says quiche on the menu it was just an egg over medium). I tasted both preparations of pork and really enjoyed it. In fact I was a little disappointed that I hadn't ordered what he had because it was much more flavorful than my soup. \n\nI would be willing to go back and try another dish and see if the flavor was improved. The environment was nice, the service was prompt and friendly, and the food was average. I might add on more vegetables next time, maybe onions and mushroom if they have it, and maybe try a pho with a different beef preparation. \n\nAlso, Pittsburgh legend Rick Sebak came in for dinner while we were there and that made me happy.",1.0,0.9596936106681824

I wasn't a huge fan of the basil and/or cilantro that came inside, so next time I would ask for them to leave the herbs out. The bun was delicious and huge! I snuck some of my remaining peanut sauce in there and poured in the sauce that came with it. I had no idea that it was fish sauce but I'm glad I didn't because I gave it a chance and really liked it! The bun had pork, noodles and eggs rolls. I only ate about half of it and was completely stuffed but not in a bad way. It was the perfect amount of food with the right spices and heartiness. As I enjoyed my meal and company, I looked around and noticed how crowded this place gets with every walk of life!\n\nGuess how much my bill was for spring rolls, bun and a diet coke? Around $8-$10. I'm serious! For the price alone, I will return, but for the food and friendly service, I will return sooner.",1.0,0.9970508813858032

Tiny bit of pickled vegetables when it needed way more and the pork was poorly cooked and seasoned. Didnt taste like banh mi at all.

I have actually heard about this place since its been opened, but I didn't have the chance to come here to eat. So I'm going to put my tastebuds to the rest on this restaurant compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants I usually go to around Charlotte.\n\nSo here's the deal. This place used to be Pho 98, and I only had the chance to go there once a very long time ago. Inside, they redesigned the place and the interesting thing I want to mention is that the back is where the cash register is.\n\nGiven the menu, I was happy to see such a large option of choices. I ordered their pho dac biet, fresh and fried spring rolls. My mother deviated and ordered one of their B\u00fan dishes. The portion, I thought was a little \""meh.\"" I mean the B\u00fan dish, vermicelli is dry with the option of the customer putting fish sauce for a little bit of flavor, wasn't so surprising in my opinion. I feel like other Vietnamese restaurants give you a lot more for your dollar. \n\nI felt as if yeah, sure it's in south side Charlotte and things can be a little more expensive but it still matters to me and how much you get with the extra money you spend. I guess all our money went to our service, which was great by the way... One thing to note was that when you sit down there is no utensils, not to worry it will come (they didn't forget.) After they served the first dish however, I thought they forgot and I was a little confused on why they would serve food before serving anything to eat with. I think they could really spend less time on the utensils if they set it up at each table beforehand.\n\nThe Pho that I ordered was okay. The portion was pretty good, a little less than I'm used to, but overall it wasn't bad. The broth was good, tasty and it's true they don't add any MSG, but I just didn't get that satisfied feeling of amazing that I usually get.\n\nOverall, from all the hype of everyone I was expecting godliness that would trump any other Viet restaurant. But, overall I just thought it was \""okay.\"" If I could give it more stars it would probably just another 1/2 star, but nothing more... One cool thing to note was that they do sell Banh Mi.",1.0,0.984429121017456

Initially, I was pretty excited that Doan's was opening. Word came around that the owners were from the west coast, Seattle specifically. I thought that would bring some competition to the table and maybe, just MAYBE, I'll have a good go-to Vietnamese restaurant on my side of town. I tried Doan's within the first few weeks of its grand opening. Then again with some friends and again with my parents, and again and again with more friends. I know restaurants cannot be judged based on grand openings. They need some time to readjust and perfect the details. Well it's been about 10+ visits and sorry, I give up. \n\nMy girlfriends and I stopped by Doan's last night after a long day of shopping. We wanted something warm to ease the chills randomly rendered (in Charlotte anyway) by mother nature. As I browsed through the menu, I thought of my previous visits. I've tried the pho before and it lacked flavor and ingredients. There was barely any meat, just noodles and broth. I've tried the Bun Bo Hue (a spicy lemon grass based soup) and there wasn't even the slightest bit of Bun Bo Hue flavor in that broth. It tasted like chicken soup with noodles and peppers. I've tried the Com Dac Biet (which is the specialty broken rice dish) and it was TINY. With all of that in mind, I went with Banh Canh, which is another traditional Vietnamese soup. Banh Canh normally comes with lots of seafood items such as crab meat, shrimp, fish balls, etc. All I got was.. fish balls. I have so little expectation for Doan's that all I hoped for was that the broth was decent enough to consume.. and it was! yay!\n\nNeedless to say, Doan's does not hold up the caliber of a Vietnamese meal. I must say, the first time I tried their Bun Bo Hue, it was AMAZING! A few months afterwards, I ordered it again and they decided to take out some of the meats and veggies that the dish comes with and oh, removed the flavor too. I never know if I'll get the same thing I ordered last time. I love supporting my Vietnamese community, but I honestly never know what I'll get when I stop by Doan's.",0.0,0.9982609152793884

There was glare, and I think that the vegetarian part was omitted.\nI ordered the summer rolls as an appetizer.  They were nicely wrapped and included tofu, vegetables and noodles.  The peanut sauce was served in a squeeze bottle, which I found somewhat off putting.  It also was sweet and syrupy, reminding me of carmel sauce.\nFor my entree, I ordered Pad Thai.  It came with tofu and vegetables, all cooked very well.  It had a smattering of peanuts to the side of the plate.  It wasn't very spicy, although I think the description called it as such.  I put a large amount of siracha  sauce on it to add that bite that I love.  The dish also seemed a bit more sweet than savory.\nThe service was good, and it definitely was not a bad experience.

I love love love Bun Bo Hue ..when it's done right.

I liked the fact that they gave some noodles and cucumbers with it so you could make your own fried spring roll concoction. \n\nMerhherh ordered the Pho and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Both were bland in flavor :| Just tasted watered down to me. I would say, maybe since it was at the end of the night so the food was lacking as they were about to close? But no, shouldn't it be even more flavorful cause the broth would be absorbing the flavor of the ingredients all day? Either way, just not my cup of tea, or rather bowl of pho.\n\nAnother thing I wasn't very fond of was that they just provide a bottle of fish sauce by the table. Not homemade?! Fish sauce in a bottle was not pleasing with my egg rolls :( \n\nThis place is definitely a hole-in-the-wall and I usually enjoy discovering hole-in-the-walls more so then fancy smancy places, but I was honestly alert my whole visit waiting for a cockroach to make its way across the floor. \n\nI guess I set my expectations a little too high.

Pho is the national Vietnamese dish. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be so many restaurants with it in the name like this place.  Any place worth its salt has a go-to recipe that satisfies anyone craving the soup.  \n\nSo who can mess up something as important as Pho?  This place.  They have done it in a manner that offends Vietnamese cuisine in no other way I have ever before experienced.  This national cuisine is considered one of, if not THE, freshest food on the planet.  \n\nWho ruins Pho Ga?  This place.  Unfortunately, this place has no idea about freshness.  Pho is a healthy, nutritious, and savory soup.  Simple, yet elegant.  The atrocity they served me was not only bland, but so oily that I couldn't get rid of the clammy sensation from my mouth for hours.  The meager chicken pieces floating in it were not only bland, but exceedingly DRY.  So dry that I had to drink the bland iced tea they served so as to swallow, because the broth was so oily and revolting.  Unfortunately, I was so hungry I forced myself to gnaw on the the chicken and the hard noodles.\n\nMy partner's hot and spicy soup with shrimp was as greasy or more.  In fact, the oil beaded up on our spoons repelling the water-based soup.  She said the shrimp had freezer burn in its taste.  She also tried to salvage something edible from her horror.\n\nThe sad thing is that we spent over 30 minutes trying to find the place as a result of Yelp when we looked for a place in Mesa.  So I had to warn people about this joint.  Unfortunately, we weren't aware that there were 2 different places right down the road in Chandler.\n\nSo for Vietnamese cuisine's sake - Do NOT eat here.  I wish we could get away with not having to give one star.  It was so bad.  The sad thing is that the appetizer of Spring Rolls was actually decent, then the crap hit the fan.  Or in this case, the Pho.",0.0,0.9961436986923218

The noodle dish came with beef tender flanks seasoned with a lemongrass sauce and your usual carrots, bean sprouts, and mint.  Not a bad dish at all and presentation wise was quite appealing; I had to add a couple more mint and bean sprouts cause I love mines with a plethora of vegetables! \n\nIn the end, the place serves it's purpose.

The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood d\u00e9cor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.\n\nThe Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. \n\nThe server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.\n\nI then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, \""We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink.\"" Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.\n\nThe owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, \""I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro.\""\n\nI have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.\n\nI would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.",0.0,0.9975938200950624

I'm used to eating Pho in Southern California, Philadelphia and Houston, TX so I have tried pretty much every Pho restaurant in the Phoenix area to see which comes close.  This place out of all the places I tried (Pho Avina, King Eggroll, Little Saigon, Pho Than, Un-Phogettable, Pho Binh Minh, 43rd Express, Pho Nhat, Pho Saigon and Pho 68) came the closest to what I have eaten in Westminster (arguably the best city for Pho outside of Vietnam) in AZ.  Ordered the Spring Rolls, Banh Mi and Bun Bo Hue while my girlfriend ordered the Egg Rolls and Beef Pho, and we both ordered the Cafe Sua with our meals.  The broth was both clear and very robust with flavor, with only a slight tinge of sweetness.  The waiter was brought out the fatty broth when requested on the side (one of the few Pho places here that does it, out in CA it is standard) and the red pepper paste tasted freshly made instead of the packaged kind you find in the store.  Not only was the food plentiful (we got a quick and free refill of the condiments/soybean sprouts), but with everything my girlfriend and I ordered, the total bill only came out to $23 total w/ tax.  This is my go-to spot for Pho in the Valley after countless trial and error and a whole-hearted recommended for anyone who loves Vietnamese cuisine as much as we do.\n\nAnd the service was exemplary.  The owner/waiter was constantly attending to our table without being asked (even though we went during a full peak hour), which is very unlike most Vietnamese restaurant service (where they take your order and then ignore you until you pay the bill).  In terms of quality AND quantity of food, service and price, this is hands down the best bang for your buck.",1.0,0.9885537624359132

I took my parents after we ate at Hot N Juicy Crawfish next door and it was the perfect place to cool our palettes from the strong cajun flavors!\n\nI had the #1 Bambu Special Dessert and it is awesome! It's super refreshing and they use great ingredients. The #1 includes longan, basil seeds, coconut meat, pandan jelly, and coconut water. Legit coconut water-- not any of the Vita Coconut Water stuff. For those of you who've had a fresh coconut before, you know what I mean! My brother got the coffee milk tea. I might not recommend that one so much... Its a little too bitter and bland but maybe it just wasn't to our taste. They also ran out of boba when we got there so I didn't get a chance to try it.\n\nThe service was really great. They let us stay until \""whenever everyone leaves\"" (way after closing), and all the servers were really nice!\n\nAtmosphere is very much like most other boba places- bright, free wi-fi and has lots of seating. They're also great for groups and family friendly.  They played Vietnamese Pop on the tv which I thought was funny because they remind me a lot of Kpop groups, but that's just a random side note.

I always get my #10 (red tapioca, grass and pandan jelly and ADD longan and basil seeds).

Yum yum yum!\n\nI kept seeing this place pop up on yelp so decided to give it a try. Turns out, pho so 1's owner's son runs this place! My family and I have been going to pho so 1 for years so when I found out, I was super excited. My mom got to the restaurant first and she was waiting outside.  As soon as Khai saw her, he ran out and told her he'd get a table started while she waited for the rest of us to arrive. What awesome service. We felt like VIPs :P\n\nNot your typical vietnamese pho place. They have the common pho combos and also offer a variety of other fresh seafood items. I got the oxtail pho. It was ~$12, on the pricey side for pho... but totally worth it. My bowl came out with 3 huge pieces of oxtail! It also comes with a side of dipping sauce for the meat. Mix them up and squeeze a little bit of lemon and its delicious!\n\nMy sister got Mi Sate. It came out and looked delicious but it definitely was not. It tasted like someone took half a jar of peanut butter and mixed it in with her soup. Way too peanut-y and sweet. Not a fan.\n\nOne other minor complaint I have about this place is that my very Vietnamese mother had a difficult time ordering the specific pho combo she wanted. Their menu had the basics. She typically gets pho chin tai nam... not on the menu. Totally not a problem but when she tried to order, both my mother and the waitresses were confused. Neither of them spoke Vietnamese. I don't mind this at all but I know my mom wasn't too happy. She'd be more comfortable with going to a solely Vietnamese speaking establishment so I probably wont be coming here with my family but I know for sure I will be back with some friends!

Although, I did not get a chance to try her dish, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  My soup was awesome, what was great about the dish was the after part.

It was full of flavor, right about of onions, and did not have whatever component that makes you thirsty. Kuddos!!\n\nI am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept. The food was definitely fusion, I mean where can you get fish tacos and chicken wings at any other Vietnamese restaurants.   I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients;  the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about. \nSure, this visit was brief, but I will definitely be back to try it out again and again.

I was most dissapointed by the hamachi tacos. 3 of the tiniest tacos the size of a pinky finger and literally a teaspoon of fish in each for over $10. I also ordered the oxtail fries. It had an interesting flavor with Viet spices that were very pronounced. It was ok but the 6+ chunks of gelatinous fat really grossed us out. These pieces were about 2\u00d72\"" of pure fat! I think they were trying to pay homage to the oxtail fries at Bachi but really fell short. Wings are always good and the steak and egg platter was as well.

The food, the staff, the restaurant itself (super clean) = SUPERB\n\nI come from a family of Vietnamese restaurant owners and grew up serving bowls of pho, bun thit nuong, and cafe sua da to the masses so I'm a bit critical when trying new Vietnamese restaurants. Often times the best places are the ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shops that serve up the best grub.  Pho Lan, although not a ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall, is a very tasty mom and pop shop that serves up some really clean (note: NO MSG -- I know this b/c I wasn't bloated as hell after I left) authentic Vietnamese cuisine. \n\nI visited Pho Lan twice in the span of 4 days. I was sober the first time (Thursday during lunch) and hungover the second time (Saturday with 8 of my gfs during lunch -- come on, it's Vegas). Both dining experiences were great. \n\nUpon entering, the place was a little empty (probably b/c it's new and just opened). It's very clean and organized for a Vietnamese restaurant. If you've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant, it's typically a freakin circus.  Anyway, I figured, \""ohh... it's going to be one of those places that's pretty, but the food will be blah\"" but decided to give it a go.\n\nI had the fried egg rolls and chicken wings to start.  The egg rolls were fried to perfection and the chicken wings were to die for (just the way my mom makes them). I also had the Pho Ga which was super clean and flavorful. The second time I came, I had the Pho Dac Biet and tried my friend's Bo Luc Lac (shaky beef).  Both items totally hit the spot.\n\nAnother thing to note, the wait staff were super friendly and accommodating.  They charged my iPhone for me while I ate (what some restaurants in NYC charge $30 for -- damn you Standard Hotel East Village!!).  Also, the bathroom is freakin immaculate (I need to get the name of their cleaning lady). \n\nIf you're in Vegas for work or leisure, drop by Pho Lan. You're in for quite a treat.",1.0,0.9902682900428772

The food is pricey compared to most restaurants. $7-$9 for a bowl of pho. You can find much, much better pho for $5-$6 a bowl.\n2. The spring roll: the beef was dry and was more like steak meat cut up and put into it. Usually, you find spring rolls with shrimp and/or pork.\n3. The pho: when it came out, I tasted just a bit of the broth because that's the most important part of pho. It was sweet! I've never in my life had pho that was pre-sweetened. It baffled me that they would even bother bringing out the hoisin sauce. That's what the hoisin sauce is for: to provide some sweetness to the soup's broth. It was like drinking sugar water. I had to ask for some fish sauce to try and balance the sweetness. They brought me a little sauce bowl for it and I dumped the whole thing into the soup - it didn't help. If anyone's tried fish sauce, they understand how salty it is. I could only eat the meatballs. I couldn't stomach the rest.\n\nI'm shocked at how upset I am by how poor the food tasted. I'm offended that people will come into this restaurant thinking that this is representative of Vietnamese food.

Some of the staff was more worried about eating their own meal in the same room when I dined there.  \n\nHowever, the worst part of the meal were the Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Chicken.  At first, the Chicken looked like nice strips of white chicken breast meat, but either it was spoiled, poorly prepared inconsistent with health department guidelines, or it was the cheapest and worst quality chicken on the market as it had such a terrible rotten and spoiled taste.  After a few bites, I was absolutely disgusted, and decided to stop eating, pay the check, and leave the restaurant.\n\nI did not feel well the rest of the day and evening.... and I could hardly eat anything else until the next day.  Not a good experience I would recommend for others.\n\nI think the people running the restaurant were nice people, but they really need to learn how to delivery quality service, how to invest in and prepare quality food, and most of all figure out a way to keep the restaurant from smelling like a sewer when customers walk in...  at least that is what it smelled like to me when I came there...\n\nI love Vietnamese food, and would love to see more quality Vietnamese food served in Charlotte and all over the country, but not at this poor quality level.

Their menu consists of many popular Vietnamese items, such as Pho, Bun Thit Nuong, rice dishes, etc... \n\nTwo things that came to my mind when I was browsing through the menu. The first thing is I gotta try their Pho and hopefully (very hopefully) that Vegas finally has a good Pho joint. The second thing that came to my mind was \""what the pho with the price\"".Holy macaroni, their Pho has to better be damn good if they want to charge $15 a bowl + tax. Almost eveything in their menu ranges from $13 to $15, Normally you would find this prices in the strip, but Rio is like 5 blocks away from Chinatown. \n\nAnyway, I ordered their Pho combo and it came out pretty quick. The bowl consists of noodle, rare steak, sliced beef shank (what the heck??? beef shank doesn't go with Pho, beef shank normally go with Bun Bo Hue), and soup. For those that are not familiar with Pho, the combination normally goes with thinly sliced rare round steak, cooked brisket, tripe, tendon. \n\nDid this bowl of Pho pass my taste test? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The soup was bland and un-flavorful (is this a word?). I had to put a bunch of fish sauce and hoisin sauce to make it edible. The thinly sliced steak was tender, but the beef shank tasted fatty and not right for Pho. Overall, Pho is two stars.\n\nOverall, they better cut down the price or improve the quality if they want to attract local customers. Since it's so close to Chinatown, I highly doubt they can rely on tourists as their main customers if they don't improve on their food.",0.0,0.9963722229003906

It has all of the ingredients it needs to be a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene, except for what I call \""food design\"".\n\nFor example, the Drunken Beef - basically filet mignon cubes with fried onions - had a big problem: the beef was tough and chewy, probably because they used the filet mignon tips, or possibly because the meat was not filet mignon at all.  The crispy rice bowl with chicken was a smallish bowl of cripsy rice, but it came with such a scarcity of chicken and vegetables that it wasn't much beyond the rice.  The chicken that was there was dried out.\n\nThere were other issues with the food as well.  The free broth served with the meal was bland except for a strange almost cinnamon taste.  The egg rolls were small and the filling was mushy.\n\nAlthough prices at Slanted Rice are not high (our entrees were $16 and $20), the portions are small and the value is barely there.  On the other hand, service was good, the menu was interesting, and the ambiance was inviting, but that was not enough to make up for the food, which was passable at best.",0.0,0.9964505434036256

It's both comfort food and a staple. \n\nThis was my first visit to Pho Lan after being badly disappointed at the other place I frequent in Las Vegas. We visit only once a year during CES, and so did not realize that Pho Saigon 8 had gone down the tubes. Checking out the Yelp reviews, we settled on Pho Lan, and the reviews were reliable as usual.\n\nThe place was large and clean. Service was excellent - friendly without being too obtrusive. The Pho broth was delicious - it is the lighter style but delicious and not salty at all. However, it could have been a bit hotter as it was not hot enough to cook the bean sprouts I had stuck in there. I ordered #7 which was the more expensive combination, but there seemed to be just a couple of strips of tripe and tendon. Far too little - even though these are the cheap bits (which I love best). There was barely enough meat to go with all the noodles. \n\nWill be back next year...... and hopefully give them another star.",1.0,0.9278963804244996

We had over 15 options for Pho within a half a mile. That said.. I've had some phenomenal pho and am quite particular about it.\n\nWe live very close and we were so excited when this restaurant opened. We've been there several times since the opening and and would highly recommend it.\n\nThat said, the Pho is slightly better and more flavorful at Chandler Pho. However, the  atmosphere here far surpasses Chandler Pho and the service is wonderful.\n\nThe vermicelli is absolutely amazing. Though I recommend eating in the restaurant.
