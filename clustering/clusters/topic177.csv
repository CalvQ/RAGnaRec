I have always had an exceptionally positive and enjoyable experience shopping there for make-up. I try to go on weekdays since it gets crazy busy during the weekends. There is one girl in particular who I really like, unfortunately I don't know her name. She always finds me the perfect shades and doesn't try to up sell me on thing I don't need. I have had negative experiences with other MAC counters where they feel real judgmental but I haven't experienced that here. I have only had to wait for assistance if I go on the weekend but I don't blame them, there are 15 girls needing help with a fraction of employees. So that's why I go on weekdays and avoid that problem all together. I think MAC is revamping their customer service since the last few times I've been there they ask me to do some customer service survey online or something and the service has been great for the last year.\n\nI would give them a full 5 stars but there are a few things I don't like. 1st and most importantly their LIGHTING SUCKS! Maybe a marketing scheme of some sort? Second, I was asking to see an eyeshadow and the man puts his finger right in it implying that I didn't need him, I could've just shoved my fingers right in there too. He made me feel bad for asking and I thought that was kinda gross. The last thing I didn't like was a woman was helping and didn't feel like she was nailing the colors I was describing like the lady I like. She kept trying to up sell me on everything. I gave her a list of what I needed and the colors of things I was browsing. I could tell when I was picking out brushes she wasn't helping me find a brush for my desired look but recommending the most expensive brushes. Even with these negative experiences the girls/guy are pretty nice. \n\nAll in all I love MAC makeup, it's pretty much all I wear except my foundation primer. I will be in love with MAC forever!

My sister needed more foundation and I needed more lipstick, at the very least. We decided to see if we could get our makeup done first, then shop. The MAC outside Belk in the mall didn't have anyone available, so she called the counter inside Belk to see if they did. We were told who to ask for there, and off we went. We informed them we had an hour and a half. The first girl started on my sister and asked the girl cleaning the counter if she'd take care of me...she looked none too thrilled about it, but said ok. After about 15 minutes of not being acknowledged, I asked the girl working on my sister if I should just go elsewhere. She went and said something to the other girl, and came back and directed me to a chair...where I waited another 10-15 minutes. At this point, my sister had also been sitting there while both our girls helped other people shop, rang them up, etc. We finally left, because we were running out of time and no one was working on us. We went over to Benefit where they were super helpful, friendly, and we ended up buying their makeup instead. Love MAC'S products, but the service lost a sale. We understood that we were a drop-in and they usually can't work on you to the exclusion of people shopping, but it was just so bad that we felt they shouldn't have even committed to doing our makeup if they were so busy.",0.0,0.999546229839325

I have to write about my love for Sephora. Sephora is the adult equivalent to FAO Swartz for makeup. The second I walk inside, I feel giddy, my wallet feels too empty, I find my perfume and makeup wardrobe at home to be too dull and too dreary and I float through the store with a permanent smile on my face. \n\nAs most ladies know, Sephora is full of perfume, bathing supplies and cosmetics galore. No matter the brand, the skin type, the quality or the budget you can find something right for you at Sephora. The staff is friendly and helpful without being too pushy. Pushy makeup artists are the worst. You can test, sample and spray to your heart's desire. They have the Sephora brand with amazing deals on lipstick, eye shadow, brushes and more. During the holidays and throughout the year, various specials line the counter tops. The rewards program allows you to justify why you spent so much because you could walk away with a brand new philosophy primer, smash-box kit or some clinique products. \n\nI've been shopping and browsing Sephora for years and the Fashion Square location couldn't be more perfect and fatal to my wallet all at the same time. Sometimes I walk through the store on the way to my car. Bad move Lindsey because when did I ever think I could just walk through Sephora without making an itty bitty purchase. \n\nLancome, Lorac, Narz, Clinique and Dior -- just to name a few of the products available at Sephora. Any perfume imaginable is available here. Lipsticks, glosses, nail polish, tanner, powder, shampoo, lotion...I could go on for days. So next time a yelper asks where they should go for some makeup, send them in the direction of Sephora. I'll probably see them there.",0.0,0.8258910179138184

The lotion is about $15 I think, it has lasted me a long time already.  \n\nNatural mint w/ Shea butter lip balm - \n\nWhen you live in the desert, it isn't difficult to see your lips get chapped, pink and puffy.  Not a good look.  This stuff is brilliant.  It smells really clean and fresh, isn't oily like carmex, and it works very well.  It even lightly tingles your lips as you apply it.  It's about $7 a tube, but the tube lasts me a month at least.  \n\nSure Sephora has all sorts of great colognes, perfumes, makeup, and skin care products.

We stopped in and asked one of the saleswomen in the store, Barbara, about the La Prairie 24 carat gold product.  One of my wisest, oldest, and closet friends who's living the life in London, Davinchi, told me about an interesting experience he had with this particular skin care product which is made in France.  \n\nThe product is beautifully encased in a gold cylindrical container that is shaped like a thick, gold-plated, humanoid penis.  Barbara squirted a small amount of the super serum onto the back of our hands.  The serum was clear and viscous.  There were literally tiny, sparkling flecks of gold flakes suspended in the essence that were clearly visible to the naked eye.  Rubbing the serum into my skin with a circular motion, it took a bit of time for it to dissolve thoroughly and to absorb through the outer skin layer.  It left a slightly tacky finish, a slightly golden tinge on my skin, and an earthy, musky fragrance that reminded me of wild vegetation growing in the rainforest.  \n\nBarbara allowed Karen and me to apply a small amount of the product to our faces.  We applied it to the base of our foreheads, cheeks, and nose.  Barbara promised that within a few hours we would notice a significant improvement in our skin hue and condition.\n\nBefore leaving the COS Bar, I noticed that the 5 inch, penis shaped, gold plated container only contains 1 fluid ounce of product.  And, the price is $570.  \n\nWe walked around the commons for a bit and eventually forgot about the serum on our faces.  But, later that night in my hotel room while brushing my teeth I looked into the mirror at me staring at me and remembered Barbara's promise.  I looked at every detail of my face carefully, every line, ridge, and undulation, searching for improvement.  Everything looked pretty familiar. I sighed. I sighed a heavy sigh of relief.  I guess I wouldn't want to ever be anyone other than me - that's right, me with all my flaws and my imperfect skin.  \n\nI finally noticed that my cheeks seemed to glow in a brighter shade of a golden hue.  But, it was probably because I was happy.\n\nThere's no cosmetic that works better than happiness.",1.0,0.9525886178016664

I'm a local who works retail and customer service also, so I know what to expect.. I was looking to get a foundation but I couldn't figure out which exact color/style Makeup Forever foundation samples I had received last time at another Sephora store, so I stopped by this one to maybe get some help. A man working there did ask me what I needed then asked one of the Sephora associates to service me. I let her know I was in a hurry but I just needed to figure out which of two different Makeup Forever foundations I had wanted to get, and that I'd be back to buy it after trying out the two samples. She, unlike this wonderful lady Gina who had helped me at another Sephora - could not match my skin tone to the brand! And barely even tried. She even used the makeup ID machine and everything and wasted a lot of time trying to show me other things when I had told her again I was set on Makeup Forever, I liked the foundation and shade I had tried out previously I just couldn't remember which one it was. She acted like there was nothing she could do about trying to find out my shade. So I told her ok I think it was either of these two shades, can I just get one sample from either type of foundation in that shade I guess. I had told her I don't want to try it on but she still tried to put some on my face without warning, I had to tell her again no thank you, Im pretty sure it might be this shade, if not I'll still be able to try it and use it as reference. I'll just try them on later at home so if I could just get some samples. She got in a huff and grabbed a completely different shade that was far too dark for me and gave me some miserable samples of each.. later on at home I didn't even have enough to apply on my whole face. After she handed me the samples I thanked her and glanced at her name tag that said Danielle. I almost feel like it said Danielle K, but I am not 100 percent sure since this was two months ago. She told me her name was something else and that she was wearing someone else's jacket... hmm, interesting. Since when do people wear someone else's name tag? I've never been so disappointed by my service at a Sephora. She was very rude and didn't really seem to care to listen to what I wanted and needed. And I have the suspicion that she tried to lie to me about her name. If she really isn't Danielle I wouldn't want Danielle to have to face the heat from a negative yelp review.. this lady was tall, darker complexioned and had a mole on her face.

But, I figured while I was there, let's see if I can find a moisturizer that would mask my ruddy red cheeks.  And as luck would have it, I was attacked by a young lady who told me that my choice of Bare Escentuals was all wrong as it would turn me green and she led me to something that starts with an L' (not L'Oreal, but I can't remember what it was).  I told her that I don't do makeup and was just looking for moisturizer, so she popped me into a chair and promptly made me up for the next episode of Toddlers and Tiaras, The Menopause Years.  I did like the moisturizer until I realized it was $90 for a tube the size of a travel toothpaste.  Pass. I'll stick to my $15 Eucerin.  I posted pictures on FB of the *four* makeup remover towels that it took to remove the pretty - holy cow.  But whatevs... some ladies like that, so it's good to have that service.  I just don't like to be Tammy Faye'd.  The young lady was very pleasant and I am sure all of my friends who are used to seeing me sans makeup would have been delighted.  I was skeered and felt my pores screaming.\n\nOnto the search for the color corrector...  I couldn't find it.  I was also looking through about 400 boxes of hair color and couldn't remember what brand made the color corrector, so I asked for assistance.

I started wearing makeup in my early 20's, and quickly stumbled upon this line. Its all natural, so its good for your skin, and being a loose powder it feels like you dont have anything on at all. But, I am digressing from the fact that this is a review of the STORE, and not the makeup itself. \n\nGoing back on point, it is SO MUCH BETTER to shop for their makeup in one of the boutiques as opposed to going to a store like Sephora. Why?\n\nSELECTION.\n\nIf you go to a Sephora store, they will only have a small handful of the different eyeshadows/blushes/etc in stock. You go into the store, and you're amazed by the wide range of shades and colors available. It's like walking into a rainbow, except the rainbow is tiny pots of color all laid out on a table for the employees to work their magic on you.\n\nI brought my friend in because she really needed to update her makeup. I suggested she check out this line because since she rarely wears it, it would be something that could last for a while, as well as give her the flexibility in amount of coverage and color she wants.\n\nThe salesperson we had (I'm sad I didn't get her name), promptly showed my friend different colors and techniques to apply the make up on. She patiently answered all the questions my friend had, and even did up her eyes completely at my friend's request. She explained the different brushes, and how she achieved the look and everything. My friend was ridiculously happy and walked out with her brand new makeup confident that she could replicate the look herself.  She even color matched me to make sure that I was using the correct shade still (which I was!).\n\nAnother benefit of purchasing the set at the store is that you get a different \""freebie\"" inside the kit as opposed to Sephora. At Sephora you get a small tube of the foundation primer, but at the store you get a full tube of the brush wash, which I think is more valuable than the small primer sample.\n\nI can't wait to go to my local Bare Escentuals store now and pick up some new eyeshadows!",1.0,0.8124234080314636

The very helpful staff quickly got me into a chair and tried a few different day and evening eye makeup looks (what I walked into the store for.)  They also checked to make sure my daily routine is working, including confirming that the shades I use still fit my skin tone.

Robbie (and everyone else I came in contact with) totally blew that out of the water.  He was really friendly and sweet, (and had breathtaking brows and shadow!) asked a lot of questions, made selections based on my answers, and was not pushy AT ALL about product purchase (disclaimer: Sephora does expect you to spend a certain amount, either $125 or $150 on products used during the makeover, but I believe the Color IQ is free).  He gave me a lot of different ideas and options, and I LOVED the look he gave me. The products themselves came from several different lines, and I liked that, too.  The skin care products he used on my face were a line I'd heard a lot about and was considering purchasing, so Robbie gave me a brief rundown on them and had another consultant come over and give me even more info while he gathered up my cosmetic purchases.

IT is not a Wet n Wild Walgreen's type of makeup.  I typically get medication from a pharmacy and not cosmetics with the exception of those Neutrogena makeup remover wipes, love em.  I politely informed her IT is higher or middle end and I saw it at ULTA a few days ago.  She didn't believe me?!

She has the receipt...\""\nThen she hangs up and tells me the manager says we dont do returns for used merchandise. She says- when we sold it to you it wasnt like this.

I can not leave without spending more than I really need to.  I always find something that would fit amongst my collection of other underused makeup and hair products.  But, none the less, this store is A+, I just wish the products did not cost so much!\n\nThe prices are equivalent to similar stores but has higher-end and more variety of the brands they do carry, such as Benefit (my fave), Smashbox, Urban Decay...the list goes on.\n\nThe employees that work there also love what they do.  I have been able to come in and get fabulous ideas and on top of it all, they will sit me down and try and teach me how to use their ideas.  And for someone like me, who is fairly incompetent in makeup application, is a nice service to have.\n\nPS. Sign up for the rewards program (Beauty Insider).

He was nice enough to show me the colors that were sold out.

It has the same quality & still very pigmented. Oscar told me that there's an Inglot in Macy's at San Francisco, so I will definitely visit that store.\n\nThe only thing I'm disappointed is their return & exchange policy. I asked Oscar if I'm able to order the Freedom System eye shadows & if I was unsatisfied, would I be able to return or exchange it? Oscar said, unfortunately that's a set back for Inglot. Compared to MAC cosmetics you can return or exchange any product if you're unsatisfied with it. With the Freedom System products, there are no returns or exchanges. I guess I'll be swatching the colors first in SF before placing an order online.",0.0,0.707961916923523
