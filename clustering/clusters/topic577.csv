It's not to far from my house to I thought I'd give it a try despite the negative reviews on yelp. I called around 7:30 am and the guy on the phone was super pleasant and told me that they didn't open until 9 but I could come by right away. I got to the shop and James the owner found arms that matched my frames the best (there was no other way to fix them) and within 20 mins my glasses were put back together and ready:) it cost me 38$ but that is a lot cheaper than 100+ dollars and waiting a week for new glasses to come in. he is a new owner of the business and is super friendly! I highly recommend going to James to see if he can fix your glasses w/o having to buy new ones.,1.0,0.9927347898483276

I wanted to custom frame a poster and I have never talked about custom framing to anyone before!

Although I literally had them in my hand when a woman came along with a shopping cart and told me she had just gone to get it because she wanted to put THOSE martini glasses in it. I know she wasn't lying so I gave them up. I expect karma to pay me back real soon.",0.0,0.9975726008415222

If you don't get this within  reasonable amount of time you should get a discount.  After this I am no longer a customer of LensCrafters!",0.0,0.9996238946914672

I was there waiting for an Rx to be filled, decided to browse the glasses and the 23 year old that probably lives in his mothers basement offered to tighten up my glasses (that I was wearing). Really, he brought it up, then when asked said it was going to be free. All he did was take them into the back room, they did stay up better....but then, literally less than 5 minutes later said it would be $5.00. Long story short I choose to pay since I feared security was going to hassle me on the way out. \n\nAdditionally I do not see why people say Walmart is so cheap. Really, occasionally I find good bargains but I can find prices just as good in many other stores.",0.0,0.996031939983368

I took it back to the store and the store manager Rick refused to offer a refund or even a partial refund.
