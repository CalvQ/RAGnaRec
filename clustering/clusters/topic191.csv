And not very densely stocked.  I noticed a few cool indie comics, including Paping.  Also quite a few boxes of back-issues, which are always fun to browse.

If they don't have it, I'm just going to go on Amazon and buy it.  Or buy it directly from Fantagraphics.  Or Drawn & Quarterly.  Or what ever.\n\nI really wish the first room that you enter through had also been full of comics.  Why is it almost totally empty?  So many more comics could fit into this store.

As a girl who played with barbies and my little ponies rather than superman and batman, I didn't know where to even begin, but the yelp reviews promised me a store full of vintage and new comic books and stocked full. Upon walking in, I realized immediately that the store lived up to its yelp expectations. \n\nI consulted the man behind the counter because I didn't even know where to begin. I told him that I was looking for a vintage comic book for under $20 but something that a collector would appreciate. He immediately took out a binder full of a backlog of every single comic book in the store and a history behind each book. I'm talking about a villain's first appearance to the first time a superhero found a new trait. It was like another language to me but I knew this guy knew what he was talking about. Comics like the walls, the shelves, the counters, the cabinets. They are everywhere. If you are a fan of the comics, this could be your kryptonite... to quote an all star super hero of course. \n\nSo after twenty minutes of searching for the perfect comic book, I finally found the one. According to the comic book connoisseur himself, this 1959 spider man comic was the first time Mary Jane appeared on a cover. It's no first edition Batman but for the price, a collector will appreciate it. So, with that I took my brand new (old) comic book and was on my way. \n\nSo all you comic book lovers...I am pretty certain this is the place you want to be to spend the days reading about heroes and villains.

Mike Malve, the owner, has been a good friend of mine for years and I owe him an apology for not doing this sooner.  However, if you get to know Mike, you will feel the same.\n\nAtomic Comics, at all its Arizona locations (not the grubby wannabe in California) is, hands down, the best comic store I have ever been in in my 45 years (sob) on this Earth.  One of Mike's secrets is that he hires people who not only know comics, but have people skills as well.  His employees are actually helpful (no, really).  They can work just as easily with a dyed-in the wool anime geek or a woman looking for a gift for a boyfriend she has only just started dating.  Trust me, these people will help you find a perfect gift (I like gift cards from Atomic if you are wondering).\n\nAtomic's \""secret recipe,\"" though, is Mike himself.  When it comes to selling comics Mike is a genius. His stores are spacious, well-lit and organized so that they are welcoming to even a first time buyer.  This is key because a bad shop can turn someone off comics as quickly as a good movie can turn someone onto them.  Mike has cool promotions and sales, often tied in with movie releases, holidays or Rodney Dangerfield's birthday.  If you are near an Atomic store, I encourage you to subscribe to their website.  The weekly coupons alone can save you a fortune.\n\nIf you get to know Mike you will learn that he really cares about the industry and making it better, both in terms of sales and content/quality.  As a result, he has a lot of great connections and he works really hard to make people respect the medium as a legitimate art form.  Despite the fact that he is incredibly hard working, he is also one of the kindest and funniest guys you could ever want to meet.\n\nRun, don't walk, to an Atomic Comics near you.",1.0,0.9962224960327148

Back then, it was in a different building, but even up until the last year or so the staff have been really helpful. Most of the things I read and watch are foreign, so up until a few months ago, the staff were incredibly helpful in tracking down whatever it was that I was looking for.\n\nWell, I don't know where they got their current staff, but they need to send them back. Most days I walk in, I'm either ignored completely while the staff seems to have disappeared, or when they are there, the person I can only assume is the manager (?) hits on me. I realise I'm taking my life into my own hands as a female entering a comic shop, but the staff there is awful either way.\n\nThe prices I can forgive if the service is at least going to be good. But Atomic Comics charges WAY more than other stores in the valley, especially on back issues, toys, and shirts, at least from what I've seen. I don't remember if they were always this pricey, but for less money I can go down to All About Books and Comics, Hero Comics, or wherever and buy back issues for cover price with a floor staff that actually seems to know what they are doing. \n\nOne of the more aggravating things I've noticed is how often they rearrange this store, as well. It's like navigating a labyrinth some weeks just trying to get to the posters in the back. Only instead of a minotaur in the center, there's an asian guy waiting to hit on you, or some kids screaming and playing magic cards. I haven't noticed the big card tables outside on weekends in a long time, maybe they finally cut the card playing out or something, but either way that's really the only positive thing I can add.",0.0,0.9988206028938292

How could this comic shop be related to the same one I constantly see at conventions? \n\nFirst off, their lay out is all over the place.

I hadn't read comic books in several years at that point, but it was hard not to feel my interest reviving as I talked to him - he happens to be one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met, and he's passionate about comic books. As such, he's got no qualms helping you sort through the stinkers to find something that will appeal to your tastes - it is through Ken that I was able to discover writers and artists who I've continued to enjoy over the years. \n\nDrawn to Comics is small, but it makes excellent use of its space - Ken manages to cram in impressive number of cards, figurines, t-shirts, comics, manga, and miscellanea. He's also one of the more attentive staffers I've ever met - he might take some time to get around to you, but he always does. I've never walked out of the store feeling ignored or dissatisfied with the service.\n\nA quick note to frugal customers, though - comics don't tend to be cheap, and Drawn to Comics isn't the cheapest alternative out there. All the merchandise in the store is marked at list price, and even though student discounts (and maybe a few others) are offered, you'll probably save more money if you go through Amazon or a similar retailer.\n\nThat said however, Drawn to Business is about as local as a business gets - it's family owned, unique, and charming. So, sure, I could save a few bucks by going elsewhere, but I'm all about supporting places like this. Pay this place a visit, and I'm sure you'll feel exactly the same way.",1.0,0.9963136315345764

My son was interested in buying one of their big Mastergrade Gundam models. He asked the woman at the cash register a question about whether the model included a certain stand. The package is of course in Japanese and my son wanted to make sure of the contents before buying. The woman said she would get her helper to talk to my son, apparently because she couldn't translate the Japanese. The young man who came over did not answer my son's questions except to say that these models cost alot because they are from Japan. The young man spoke English very well so there wasn't a problem with a language barrier. My son got very frustrated and we left the store. My son has been building these kinds of models since before that young man was born. I feel that they treated my son like they thought he couldn't afford to buy it. They made a very expensive mistake. We are not from here so we cannot just pop back in the store. I wish I had known this had happened but I didn't hear about this until we had already left, or I would have talked with the store myself. It is unfortunate when a store presumes to know what a customer will buy or not. We are visitors and as such we went to several comic and collector stores in Las Vegas.  Tokyp Discount is the only one we had a problem with. My son would have bought that model if he could have been assured it included the piece he was asking about.  Sorry Tokyp Discount, you may have great merchandise, but you also need great customer service. We may come back next year when we return to LV. If we do, I hope we see an improvement in how you treat customers.",0.0,0.9950270056724548

Whats even worse is the selection IMO was terrible. The entire 3/4 of the back wall is dedicated to NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA figurines. While thats great in theory, they ONLY HAVE maybe 6-8 different players for the entire league. You would think being in Arizona, maybe, just maybe there would be a Larry Fitzgerald, hell ANY Cardinals figurines, nope (im not even a cards fan', just saying). They have maybe 50 Tim Tebow figurines, 50 Jeremy Lin figurines, and just a paltry selection of players that are overhyped on ESPN. \n\nA bunch of Halo toys, some Star Wars toys, and a few custom figurines. Nothing ground breaking. Ill give the store some credit, it is nicely organized, but thats about it. I want to like this store so bad because i like the products that Mcfarlane toys has put out over the years, but this place just doesnt have anything special, nothing i cant find anywhere else or get on the internet.

Forbidden Planet's a good mix of commercial successes, cult classics and some serious anthologies for the comic buff.

I ended up having to get rid of the figure all together and later found a new one elsewhere for a slightly decreased price and in great condition.\n\nI did go back months later just to browse. Again, high prices, tons to look at, yes, but really nothing worth buying. Any collector could find their desired items through other sellers, ebay, amazon, etc. This visit, I walked out with only a comic book I was sending to a friend. It was actually a fair price for being a 16 year old comic book that was in very nice condition, boarded, and bagged. The employee was friendly and helpful too. \n\nI really don't know how to rate this store. I know it's a tourist area which automatically means a higher price so I get it.. I do. The store does carry a wide selection (but you may have to really search if you are looking for certain things in particular). The staff is friendly when they set their focus to you. But... that original first purchase of my figures (with the well hidden damage) still leaves me holding a slight grudge.",0.0,0.9967392086982728

Makes me feel like an old shop based on how nothing is bagged and boarded so you have to look for a good copy which I like. \n\nHowever they have no ethics about pricing. I bought some comics off the new wall, not marked up at all. A woman rang me up never said a word about what these comics were being sold for, even though it wasn't marked on the books and they clearly are making up their price. So I trusted her total because I wasn't adding up what I bought before I bought it, I just knew i grabbed 10-14 comics. So I get home and see that I was charge $6.60 for a comic that every other store sells for $3.99.  Now this was an incentive comic of 1:3, but no other shop in Las Vegas or Cali has ever charged me more than $3.99 for this because 1:3 is an extremely low incentive, and cover price for the regular version is $3.99, even Velvet Undergound will charge 15% below the $3.99. \n\nSo I thought this was a mistake and called and asked why was I charged more than $3.99, and was told that's what the price was.  Then when I asked why wasn't it marked with that price because it's clearly their own price and not common for those books, I was told since there was no price I should have asked.  \n\nAnd I completely agree, it's my fault. It's my fault for not assuming I was going to be killed on the price for trying to give some business to my local shops instead of buying online like everyone else is doing nowadays. But still I do not feel this was a valid reason.  So by their pricing logic, they can just make prices up on the spot if they felt like it since nothing is marked with the correct price. Granted it's their business they can do what they like, but it was a major turn off for me to ever shop here again.\n\nIt would take me too long having to ask every single price before I bought a comic.",0.0,0.9991353154182434
