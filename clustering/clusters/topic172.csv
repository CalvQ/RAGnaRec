Out with their under-sink reverse osmosis system and in with my reverse osmosis system. Problem was that their water in spigot was the type that punctures the copper pipe coming in from the wall.

I can't simply take off the spigot because that spigot has punctured the line. so, I called City Wide.\n\nThey cut off the old copper pipe with the puncture in it and welded a new piece on as well as a new quarter-turn shutoff valve. It cost me $174 which seems high for a small amount of work, but I think it was worth it. The copper coming from the wall wasn't that long and the hole was close to the wall meaning not much room to cut the pipe off or to weld a new sleeve on. \n\nCould I have done it myself?

Before going with Big Name, decided on a whim one day to call AHW because of stellar Yelp reviews.  My call was promptly answered by none other than one of  the owners of the company, who surprised me by saying that he could swing by my house within the hour for a quick 15 min quote - nothing like the two hour, by appointment, only-if-your-husband-is-also-home kind of thing that I'd grown used to.   The price he quoted was literally 1/3 of the \""big name with the bad reviews\"" company.  Still a significant expense, so I waited another four months before deciding to go ahead with it.  I called on Dec. 30, and they scheduled my install for the next day!   Even honored my original quote when they could have waited until after the first and hit me with a price increase.   Install was a little tricky, as I live in an older house and there's a bit of digging and extra plumbing involved.  However, job was done to perfection within hours by very courteous and professional installers.  My water now feels great and tastes amazing.   Here's the kicker: I had two different issues within the first week (one was truly a non-issue,  and one had to do with my irrigation line being affected by the outdoor digging/plumbing).  In each case, my call for help was received immediately and responded to, literally, within the hour.  Unheard of.   This is old-school service.  You will not regret giving these guys your business.

So he used my part instead.\nAfter the toliet was fixed, he said he spoke with his boss, and would give me a 'special deal' on getting the shower fixed, for 150$ instead. So reluctantly I agreed. He was having some problems getting it out and needed to use some of my tools. Together we got the part off, and I left him to his business. He later came back with the bill for over 400$.

He was at my house within the hour and had the job done within 10 minutes, at a great deal I might add for 8pm at night. He then inspected my leaking water heater that needed to be replaced AND gave me a deal 50% cheaper then three other written estimates i had gotten that week.

Having had prior experience with another company in Las Vegas to fix our water temperature problem, I was quite skeptical and afraid of the type of service I would receive for plumbing--the man at Larkin not only raised his voice at me on the phone but they only cared about giving us temporary fixes to our temperature problem.  However, that was not the case when I used Number One Plumbing.\n\nI called Number One Plumbing and the lady on the phone was prompt and friendly.  She then sent  a plumber to come at around the time when she said they would come, and the plumber Bill called me ahead of time to let me know he was on his way.  When Bill and Jeremy came over, they not only replaced the fixture within 10 minutes, but they explained the way the pipes and knobs work as well as taught me how to keep my pipe from cracking again in the future.  Talk about helping me keep my pipes in tact permanently instead of giving me BS ways to increase me costs!  They were even upfront about the costs and gave me a DISCOUNT!  And most importantly, they were the most personable and considerate plumbers I have ever met, unlike *cough* Larkin (who gave me attitude on the phone a couple years back).  I'm only posting this because they truly deserve pounds of cheesecake for putting me at ease.  In a city where customer service is not up to par with other states, this company is a diamond in the rough.",0.0,0.9957471489906312

Funny, how it was running again after my FIL leaves.  I swear it was just story telling and drinking.  LOL!  Anyways, I told my hubby get it fix or sleep in the tub!  The running water was driving me crazy.  He found Johnco online and give them a call.  \n\nOur tech, Jason came out and fixed the issue.  On his way out, my hubby asked him about the leaking drip system and if he knew anyone to fix it.  He gave us 2 options.  We took the cutting off supply to the drip system, since we were not using it anyways.  \n\nAbout 1 day later the toilet was leaking water outside this time.  Oh boy, this is not good.  We called and left a message.  Then we call again the next day, they asked a series of questions.  They sent out the same tech.  He explained the issue and fix it for GOOD.",0.0,0.9994230270385742

We called them again when we had the same problem in the other shower.  Scheduling was a nightmare.  We had an appointment, waited  all afternoon to get a call that they couldn't get to us. Also, we asked them to call our cell but they kept calling our landline.\n\nWhen we finally got the plumber out he didn't have the part with him. My husband had described the problem. They had a record of our prior repair but didn't bother to bring the parts. So we waited for 45 minutes while the plumber went back to their office to get it.  AND we got charged for all of his time in doing so. The bill was twice was it was for the other exact same repair.\n\nBecause Larkin was so horrible about scheduling, didn't pay attention to our needs and gouged us for the privilege, we will call another plumbing service the next we need one.",0.0,0.9973446726799012

They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer.",0.0,0.9970104694366456

The company we'd used to service our existing system for 10 years had become very pushy with sales pitches and gave us an outrageous quote on a new system. After calling several places, a family member recommended AHW. I'm so thankful! I was able to talk to a knowledgeable person right away and get an immediate quote. Their quote was the best I received. They then offered same day service and had someone out that afternoon. The installer, Jose, was very professional, called ahead to tell me exactly what time he'd arrive, and then arrived on time. He got the job done, was polite, and answered all our questions. We are very happy with our AHW experience and would highly recommend them to others. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with this fine company.",1.0,0.9996827840805054

He told me exactly what other parts I needed to get (who knew they don't come with power cords?), so the job went quickly and easily.\n\nHe also tried to get to a clog in my rear bathroom sink. His snaking tools couldn't go beyond a bend deep in the wall to get to the clog. He was extremely nice and gave me advice about next steps, including a way to find a trustworthy service company to do the advanced rooting work.\n\nI have no regrets calling Artie. His pricing was reasonable ($70 for the work, done in an hour), he was very professional. I'd call him again and definitely recommend him to friends.",1.0,0.9958539009094238
