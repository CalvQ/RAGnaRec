I have a baby so running shopping and shipping errands in 100+ heat isn't exactly easy.\n\nBy the way, my dad used this same store and paid for two day shipping (for an expensive electronic)...the package took 5 days to get there. I should've just gone to the post office. It would have been cheaper and I wouldn't be out $100+ dollars on the cost of a gift and shipment. I've never had such poor results from a UPS store.

Rather than greeting me in an appropriate manner, the old man behind the counter just said something rude like \""it's too early, I'm the only one working, you're going to have to wait.\"" And then he had the audacity to shove my package aside like yesterday's garbage. \n\nI waited for WELL OVER TEN MINUTES. Unacceptable, considering this is a place I come to, to ship packages IN A HURRY, so I can AVOID THE RUSH. Taking a short break from the other folks' transaction and sending me on my way would have taken no longer than two minutes. Even if you're the only person working, there are ways to be efficient and take care of customers. A lesson this jerk needs to learn. \n\nIf anyone at the store is reading this, you have officially lost this customer. I'll drive the few extra miles to the UPS store at Boulder/Palo Verde the next time I need to send something.",0.0,0.9995651841163636

The delivery guy said he left the package IN FRONT OF MY APARTMENT DOOR IN AN OPEN WALKWAY IN AN OPEN COMPLEX WHILE IT WAS RAINING.

All four have disappeared. Tracking says that they have been signed for by \""Front Door\"".

My pharmacy sent out another shipment and wrote \""Knock on Door\"" in giant letters all over the package and that one did actually get delivered today. Whether that is due to the note on the packs age or the fact that both I and my pharmacy called to complain yesterday, or that I spoke with a driver supervisor sometime yesterday, I have no idea. And it really shouldn't matter.  Good customer service is good customer service and OnTrac is a shining example of AWFUL customer service. My pharmacy, when I called, after remembering that they use OnTrac said that they had a lot of complaints lately.  I have emailed Amazon as well, asking them to stop using OnTrac and pointing them toward all the reviews here on Yelp. Because Amazon is generally awesome, and OnTrac is making them look bad.\n\nAlso, isn't it funny that Rob A from OnTrac has been responding to these negative reviews with efforts to help since at least 2011 (I've not finished reading all the complaints) and yet the service is still abhorrent?!

I got a wonderful customer service rep in Seattle named Kathy who, get this: DEPRIORITIZED ONTRAC IN MY PRIME PROFILE!! OnTrac will now only be used as a last resort if other shipping options are unavailable.\nGo through all the feedback steps, talk to a Stateside rep and let Amazon know how much this company sucks. The service reps know, I think. When I mentioned Ontrac, I think she whimpered. But she doesn't have the power to make Amazon stop using them.

I was pleased to see that it was actually going to arrive today. Well, as all of these other comments show, it's the same old story - shows as delivered and is not delivered. \n\nSo I take action and call OnTrac. Nice lady answers the phone, apologizes, says she will reach out to the driver and call me back in an hour. This was 2:30 on a Friday. She calls back at 4:30 to tell me that the driver won't be coming back until Monday. \""How does that help me?\"" I ask. \""It doesn't, but the driver wants to go home for the weekend and he's not near your location.\"" \""So can I have it delievered tomorrow then?\"" \""No sir, we don't work on the weekends.\"" At this point I really can't believe what I am hearing...\n\nI pay for an Amazon Prime account and expect two-day shipping. You mean to tell me that I won't get the package I ordered (which I need for Monday) because your driver is lazy and doesn't want to loop back around to figure out where the heck my package is? What about customer service? What about making sure you're delievering a good service? \n\nSo I call Amazon and they make it right by ensuring Saturday delivery with a RELIABLE carrier like UPS or FEDEX. I will have my package tomorrow no thanks to OnTrac. I filed a formal complaint with Amazon.com to remove OnTrac as a regional carrier here in Phoenix and by the looks of these reviews, I hope they start getting the message. If I had the option, I would put in my personal profile that they are never allowed to touch an order of mine ever again.\n\nWhatever you do, if you can avoid it, don't ever use OnTrac if you want reliable service and want your package delivered properly.\n\nAnd Rob A. who works with OnTrac, don't bother contacting me to ask for tracking info...\n\nUPDATE: This review was a bit delayed due to email confirmation. Since this mishap with OnTrac, I received my package from FedEx the next day. About four days later, the other package arrived on my doorstep with a note from a neighbor (not sure who) saying they delivered it to the wrong address...again.

When you actually pay for the shipping, they will give you a confirmation number and are very courteous but when you aren't paying them for the shipping they lose your packages and don't care. \n\nMy experience the reason i wanted to give them 1 star but gave them 2 because of the times they got it right. \n\nMy boyfriend spent a bit of money to get my a present but it wasn't as they described online so for the amount he paid i thought it wasn't worth it so i decided to send it back. We contacted the seller and they sent us a free shipping label but i don't have a printer here in vegas (im from california) so i went to mail plus because they said they would allow me to print my label there, so i did, and i noticed the label said ups ground, so i made sure to ask the guy, Do you guys accept ups packages? and he said oh yeah, we do. so i trusted them and left it with them. I checked ups today to track the package and they only have it that there was a label made for the return but no scan of the item what so ever, so i called mail plus right when they opened to find out what happened. They are blaming the ups guy who comes to pick up packages saying that it either got lost in the shuffle when he came to pick it up or that its lost in there warehouse. I asked could they have sent it to a wrong service they said no, usps would not accept the package if it said ups. Just in case i called both ups and usps, usps has never received this item. As for ups, they said they would scan all items before entering their truck, and that they would scan them again when it enters into their warehouse, and there's no way it was able to be shipped from the warehouse without it being scanned again, so there's no way it bypassed 3 scans. I called mail plus back explained all this, and basically they said, they are in a transition phase so he doesn't know what happened but they know that i brought in the package. that the most they could do for losing my package is to ask the ups delivery pick up guy if he knows where my package is, because you know picking up many many many deliveries everyday hes going to remember my package a couple days ago. i kept asking them what they are going to do when my package isn't found and they just kept telling me they won't tell me that, that they don't want to speculate. so basically they lost my package, and their only option is the ask the pick up guy. they also forgot to tell me that ups pick up is a courtesy service not one of their actual services, otherwise i would have driven down the street to the ups office. so thank you mail plus for losing my package and doing nothing about it.

The manager asked me to fill out a form (I would not be reimbursed for the box they made me buy to ship the books because they told me I could reuse it - despite the box being torn open).  They also told me I would not be reimbursed for the contents which was valued at $22.  I filled out the form the manager asked me to fill out and when I asked her what my case number was (one of the questions on the form) she told me she didn't know and that I'd have to do it online.  I said, \""then why did you give me a form to fill out here?\""  She just reolied again that I'd have to do it online and I may or may no hear back.  That was it.  There was nothing further they could do. \n\nUnfortunately this is not the only time I have had a package go missing when shipping through the USPS.

There is always a line here though, no matter what time of day you come., so always give yourself some extra time when you stop by.  They never have all of the windows open for some reason, which slows everything down.  They also recently removed the stamp machine, so now everyone needing stamps have to wait in line as well, which also adds to the line length.  \n\nThere is a self service machine for mailing smaller, regular packages, which is really quite nice.  You can get in and out quickly if you don't need to talk to a desk agent.  This is a huge plus for me, since I rarely need a desk agent.  I am a DIY kinda girl, so I just love it!\n\nAnother plus is the huge parking lot.  The post office by my mom has about 15 spots, so having 100 or so is nice, especially if you are mailing a lot of items.\n\nOverall, it is a decent location.",1.0,0.9976765513420104

Nope.....I went home, tried the keys and they were the same keys that they gave me the first time! (I know this because I put a distinct scratch in one of the keys.) \n\nSo I took them back and they again apologized profusely and told me that would again put a rush on our key order. They gave a big speech to my wife and I about how horrible it is that we should have to wait and that they had given us the wrong keys 2 times in row. We were skeptical but accepted the apology. \n\nIt is now 7 weeks since they \""expedited\"" our order (third shot at getting us our keys) and still no keys. We have to go to the post office twice a week to pick up our mail and stand in line to ask if our keys are ready yet. And guess what. They aren't. We were told that the post office has contracted the business of re-keying mailboxes to an independent contractor, that this contractor has 400 boxes to re-key before ours and that this contractor has only 4 guys doing the work. \n\nLong story short. This post office is a joke and should be ashamed of the way they do business. They are lazy, lying imbeciles who don't care at all about their postal customers.

Seven days after my change of address took effect, my mail carrier returned three boxes to their senders, causing huge inconveniences for me & the senders who were stuck with boxes to re-ship. One sender even had to pay double postage to get the boxes out of hock at his post office! Luckily the Meadow Mesa customer service manager, Michelle, was pleasant to work with & helped get the boxes re-shipped to me free of charge (well, not free since the senders had already paid the first time around).\n\nI had to pick up one of the boxes tonight at the post office & boy, what a horrible experience THAT was! I watched clerk Anola treat a customer ahead of me like a dog -- I've seen some rude postal workers before but that woman takes the cake. She was barking at him to lift up his boxes so she could stamp them & she walked around like she would've rather been anywhere but there. Listen, Anola, you'd be doing society a favor by getting out of the customer service business because you clearly aren't cut out for it! So after 5 minutes of witnessing this ridiculous treatment, it was just my luck that I got stuck at her window. I handed her my pickup slip & she asked for ID. \""ID.\"" No \""ID please\"" or \""May I see some ID?\"" Just \""ID\"" while looking away, totally inconvenienced she had to do her job. My ID does not have my current address so she asked me to recite it. After I did, she grumbles, \""Well, that was way too fast...\"" & walked away to get my box. What? Way too fast? If you weren't so busy making it clear I was putting you out by asking you to do your job, maybe you could've verified the address as I recited it. She returns with my box, places it on the counter & just stands there, waiting for me to take it & leave. No \""thank you.\"" No signs of a smile. Not even a \""here you go.\"" I took the box & got out of there as quickly as I could.\n\nI hope to never have to return because Anola is the epitome of unprofessionalism.

I'm not sure what the exact term for it is, but basically you can help yourself at an electronic kiosk thing (if you are shipping something).  The actual process is quick, easy, user-friendly, and efficient, but the drop box that you put your package in is always full or broken (it won't even open).  This is the reasoning behind my 3 stars.  On top of that, they only have 2 clerks running the line (at least every time I go and I've gone during all times of the day and week), making for a very time-consuming wait if you do not want to use the electronic kiosk.\n\nPros:\n * Clean, Well- maintained location\n * Priority boxes are always stocked (I find this to be a problem at other USPS locations)\n * they have the self-service electronic kiosk\n * passport services and P.O Boxes available\n\nCons:\n * Drop box is always full or broken\n * Always busy\n * Not enough clerks running the line\n\nOverall:\n  I'd be fibbing if I were to say I'd never go here again.  The truth is, it's a convenient location for me and the service is pretty good.  If they would just get more clerks and fix that troubled drop box!",0.0,0.9911091327667236

I received a phone call the next afternoon that the package had not yet left Las Vegas because there was no commercial invoice (required for shipping to Canada).

Additionally, the hub did not submit the customs power of attorney form declaring that we, the shipper, would pay the import taxes.

I drove down during my lunch break and surprisingly no other customers were there. I guess that was the only good thing about this place, not having to wait in line. The old lady that was working was very unfriendly. Boxes were all over the place and everything looked unorganized.

Irresponsible.\n\nI lost a package that was full of my cloths and art supplies with their service. They never told me that one of my package was missing before i ask for it. They just delivered rest of two boxes. i spent two weeks trying to contact them and trying to figure why my package is in transit for three weeks. They answered extremely late and never knew where the package was or about any of process that it had gone through.\n\nCouldn't deal this matter directly with Fedex because i used college box's account, not mine and which NEVER give a shit about the lost bag. After endless waiting and stupid chatting that gives no solution at all, i got a call from Fedex that it was delivered it to a wrong address. I had to request the College Boxes to request a call tag to the Fedex and wait untill the Fedex tell the college box if they found it or not and the college box tells me about it. BUT the college box never contacts you about any of answer before you ask them after getting tired of waiting. The college box even deactivated my account which has all the information with it as September came saying that i have no service going on with them. \n\nEventually i could not find the package and DID NOT GET THE REFUND for the lost items even if i paid for the insurance saying that i have $200 worthy items in my package. \n\nIt happened in August and i got the answer from them today which is November. They did not even notified that i will not get the refund. I had to ask them and wait for the mail that i have to wait more and repeating that again and again for three months. \nThey give a single sentence as a reply to your paragraph-long question and bagging for help to find the package back. I paid about $300 for three boxes and got only two package back.\n\nThis experience ruined my first months of college.\nDon't ever use this company.. it is a risk.

They offered no solution and didn't apologize for it.\nAfter tracking my package online, it said that my package had been sitting at the post office for about 3 days. I first called about it, and the guy on the phone (who I later found out was the supervisor) didn't want to listen to my situation and cut me off by telling me to hold before I was done explaining the situation. I asked him if he needed my tracking number before he put me on hold and he said \""No, first I'm putting you on hold\"" with no explanation and in a very rude, hurried tone. \nAfter being on hold for quite a while I decided to hang up and just go over there. When I went there the woman at the counter was very rude and just had a generally unpleasant disposition. After explaining everything to her again, I was referred to the supervisor, Joel, same guy I talked to on the phone. He looked for my package and didn't find it and told me that I should have come by to ask about it earlier. I didn't realize it was my job to baby sit these people and make sure they did what they were being paid to do. I told him it had only been three days and that I was trying to be patient but that I needed my package and that after being treated poorly on the phone I decided to come get it myself and that this was an inconvenience. He said he had no idea where it was and to go check with my leasing office and see whether they had it. I went back home and checked with the leasing office - nothing. At this point I was very annoyed because they offered no answers, no help, and I was being exceptionally inconvenienced. \nWhen I arrived back at the post office they said that \""maybe\"" they sent it back but they didn't know because their last notes said that they had it, but at that point it was obvious that they didn't. Their next piece of advice for me was to call the sender and see if they had it. I asked to speak to the manager, Joel told me he was the manager. I told him I didn't want a supervisor, that I wanted HIS manager. He said he wasn't in. I had to wrestle with Joel to get the manager's name (Andy) and when he would be in so I could talk to him about it. \nI called the sender, they don't have my package. It's just missing.

When I asked him WHY 2 days is 4 days I got a totally condescending attitude that everything is going ground and that the package could be delivered in 8 days because there are no flights and that that is just how it is and there are no refunds so I can file a complaint but that is how it is.  SERIOUSLY? USPS is having financial difficulty and this is your customer service. I felt like I just got screwed at the casino and just made a $12+ donation to USPS! I grabbed my  package and spent $23 at Fedex to ensure delivery. USPS just lost a customer!",0.0,0.9988580942153932
