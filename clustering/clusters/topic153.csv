Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.\n\nThe only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.\n\nWould not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether.",0.0,0.6530486941337585

So we attacked the buffet looking to try a little of everything.\n\nThe item that stands out the most to me was the Yucca Root.  While it wasn't the best tasting thing on the tray, it was the most surprising thing.  I did not think it would be nearly as good as it was but it was amazing.  I even had a second helping.  I am a big pork fan and theirs was excellent.  The beef and chicken dishes were great too.  I had a bowl of the traditional Cuban soup (whatever it was called) and loved it.

Pacific Seafood Buffet runs somewhere in the middle of the pack.  Here's why:\n\nThe sushi is probably the best part of the whole buffet.  It seems to be always fresh and I always see someone behind the counter prepping more.  I've never been disappointed at this station.  8 out of 10\n\nThe rest of the buffet is hit and miss.  IF the food is fresh (and they have it prepared out), it's OK at best.  Some dishes are over-seasoned (too salty for my taste).  I tend to judge by the Orange Chicken.  Ususally, it's a hot selling dish and has to be prepared more often because it's constantly selling out.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it about a 6,  \n\nThey also have a Mongolian Grill (again one of my favorite things normally) but it's kinda blah here.  Not enough seasoning choices for my tastes.  3 out of 10 stars for the grill.   \n\nDeserts I could care less about.  I don't go to a Chinese buffet for their desert cart.  If they have a little something to nibble on afterwards, fine.  If not, I'm OK with that too.  I really don't look for it.  \n\nService here is hit and miss too.  After the hostess seats you, you have to wait for the server to order your drinks.  Sometimes this can take a while.  Also clearing of the table and refills (and getting your check) could take a bit too.  I'll give the service 5 out of 10 stars.  \n\nThe place is also WAAAAY overpriced!  $18 for dinner??  I really don't care about price usually as long as the food and service is good.  Sorry guys but for that price this place has got to be much better for me to return.  \n\nI've been here a number of times.  I just don't go 1 time and write a review.
