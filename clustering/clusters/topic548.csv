I've ever taken my pampered pooch, Justus, to. \n\nEvery two weeks or so Justus and I take a quick trip by Stoney Creek to get his nails trimmed. Justus is a black lab and rottweiler mix, so needless to say he is a very big boy. But that doesn't scare off the stoney creek staff. The staff here handle Justus with genuine love and care. \n\nJustus' favorite groomer, Amanda, always goes above and beyond to make sure that Justus is comfortable by securing Justus, his own private room so that he is not distracted or stressed by  the other dogs and animals in the office. When Amanda comes to take Justus back for his nail dremel Justus is so excited he wags his whole body. For those of you that know how difficult it is to get your dog accustomed to vet visits you can understand how big a deal this is. \n\nJustus actually enjoys going to the vet. And I have no question that he is in great care. The staff is always very tender with his little doggie toes, and caters to his every need. Laying Justus to his side for comfort, the groomers begin to drill down the nail, all the while petting him and talking to him reassuring Justus that he is fine and everything is all right. Justus responds to their kind voices and gentleness by giving the staff kisses once his mani -pedi is complete. Praising him for being still and cooperative the whole time the groomers give Justus water, and a treat as they put back on his leash. Justus is then brought back out to the front and we are on our merry way. \n\nQuick, easy, and painless; our whole visit takes no more than 15 minutes on a busy day. So I'd like to give a great big thank you to all the staff and Stoney Creek Animal Hospital for your awesome customer service and animal care. You've made our vet visits a lot more enjoyable.",1.0,0.9992274045944214

To put the issue simply, the employee who did their nails clipped their nails and then buffed them slightly to make it look like they were buffed. Think about that for a minute. Before you claim \""crazy dog lady\"", let me explain. \n\nI have clippers and talc powder at home and could clip and dab the ends if they bleed, if I wanted to. I normally clip Lady's nails because hers are short and acceptable to be clipped without pain. However, Zeke has longer nails which I choose to buff to make the quick go down so that in future, they will be clippable without pain at home.\n\nThat being said, I repeat, my newest rescue dog, Zeke, has VERY long nails due to neglect before I adopted him. His nails cannot be cut without bleeding. I know this because when I adopted him, 2 months ago, I tried to clip one slightly, and it bled profusely. Talc powder solved that, and is not a big deal, but still, I learned they needed to be buffed until they are short enough to be cut. I very specifically requested they be buffed for this reason. \n\nHowever, they took both dogs one by one right behind their closed door (which has never been done anywhere else), and I HEARD them clipping. Everytime the door opened, I caught a glimpse of my dogs, so yes, I knew it was my dog's nails being clipped. I heard Zeke yelp at least twice, which is what crossed the line for me. I could deal with the ignorance in ignoring my request, but when I hear my dog yelping because you ignored my request, I'm ticked off.\n\nWhen I asked the employee who did their nails why I heard her clipping them, explaining Zeke's nails were clearly too long to be cut without pain, she replied \""No they're not, they were just fine. It takes a really long time to buff them. How do they look?\"" Two things wrong with this picture. 1.) I ASKED them to be buffed, PLAIN AND SIMPLE and 2.) You think talking back to me, clearly admitting you clipped them because you were busy, is going to make me change my mind about wanting them buffed? Oh, and the nails are all different lengths, so they look horrible!\n\nAfter leaving, I did call Matt, the shift manager, and he followed the problem solving regiment precisely. He was polite and offered a refund which I declined. I explained that I would like the employee spoken to and to be made aware that customer's requests are first before your own time constraints. Thank you, Matt, for that. I will not be visiting this location for any reason ever again and will notify my friends of these practices.",0.0,0.9984692931175232

It was supposedly me that was puttting those thoughts into my dog's head. Against my better judgement, I left my dog to get a haircut with specific instructions on what to cut and not cut.

They agreed and I set up the appointment. Upon entering the grooming area the groomers were all outside smoking and no one was at the desk. I waited for about 15 minutes and then I went outside and asked to speak to someone regarding getting my cat groomed.\n\nAfter they came in we discussed grooming and agreed on getting him an oatmeal bath, nail clipping, and trim. I had asked that he recieved a lion cut due to the Vegas heat. \n\nI was quoted an hour for the entire service so I was excited about the time due to the  fact I would be able to pick up groceries while he was being pampered. But before I left I noticed that here was some non-needed loud dryers going on in the back room (which had no animals in it). I asked that they only use the dryers when needed due to the fact that he is scared of loud noises, they ignored my request and tried to take him to the back. He of course would have none of that and they had to turn them off anyway.\n\nWhen I arrived back to pick him up he was just then getting dried. Another hour later they said he was done (2 1/2 hrs so far). They put him in his carrier before I saw him so I assumed he was done as we had discussed, payed them a pretty penny for the work, and went home. When I got home and took him our of the carrier I found that half of the agreed upon services were not completed. He had no lion cut, had danrif all on his fur, and his nails had been jaggly done. Needless to say I will not use their grooming services again.\n\nIn addition to the bad grooming services, this Petco has awful customer service in store. The cashiers are rarely avaliable up front and if you have questions or need anything you have to wonder around the store for some time to find someone. I personally refrain from going to Petco and instead reccomend Petsmart.",0.0,0.9994544386863708

Aside from posting here I will be contacting the BBB to submit a complaint to them.  I took my dog in on July 1st for a grooming because my other groomer was booked up and a friend recommended Smelly Dog.\n\nI dropped Betty off a bit early because the movers were coming to move in my furniture to the new house and I had appointments with the gas company and alarm company.  Her appointment was for noon and they were happy to take her as early as 930 AM.  I was thrilled.  How ever at 3:30PM I had still not heard from them.  So I called to check on Betty.   The response I got was, \""we called and left you a message.\""  No you did'nt because my phone did not ring and I have no messages.  \""Well, we did and she is ready.\""  \n\nIf that was not bad enough now it gets worse.  At 3:47 when I arrive to pick her up they bring me a dog that looks nothing like Betty.  Although also a Yorkie, the color was different, the dog had been bred, did not respond to her name, etc.  I told them this was not my dog.  The person then informed me it was and handed the dog to me.  I stated this was not my dog and they left me at the counter holding someone elses dog.  Three people returned out and started saying, \"" I called him from my cell.  I think this is the number.\""  No one even addressed me or took back this \""other\"" dog.  Finally as they started dialing numbers on of the clerks said, \""I am sorry, we asked him three times if it was his dog and he said yes.\""  So I asked where my dog was and they informed me another customer took her.  It was all I could do not to lose it.  They told me they would call me as soon as they had Betty back.\n\n20 minutes later I got a call to pick up my dog.  This time it was the correct dog.  This time they apologized and the owner came out.  She explained to me that in nine years this only happened twice. REALLY?  Once was not enough?  She then generously offered to comp my next visit back in....  WHY ON EARTH WOULD I RETURN?\n\nLater that night I found a tick on my dog.  Perhaps that would not have happened had my dog not gone home with a stranger or placed in a pen with some cleaned and yet to be cleaned dogs.\n\nToday I recieved a call to confirm my noon appointment...  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING.  I never scheduled a second appointment.  Why would I schedule an appointment on a day I am at work in the middle of the day?  I suspect the other Yorkie may have had an appointment today.  After blowing up on the clerk on the phone, the owner called to remind me that I have a free grooming coming to me...  I dont want it.

My dog was shaved even closer underneath (almost to the bare skin) and during this hack job, they nicked the area where he was neutered. This, of course, irritated him for 2-3 weeks. After a $140 vet visit, with a shot and some medicine, he is finally returning to normal. He started licking his paws recently and we found that his dewclaws were never trimmed! His haircut was so drastic at first I thought we had a different dog. They even groomed him to look female. For whatever reason they have a standard haircut for all poodles and poodle mixes. To help you translate words and phrases just in case you ever decide to use them, here are some tips: Trim=shave. Cut the nails=just cut whatever you want.

After moving to Las Vegas from So Cal last month, I was happy to schedule a grooming appointment for our little Princess Sophia. \n\nI spoke to Brook one of the owners and was able to get an appointment the following day and she seemed very friendly and casual. I told her that we had a malti tsu about one year old. \n\nBrook the woman who groomed Sophie did let us pick out some pink bows to put in her hair and had numerous cats walking freely around the business. Great if you like cats, not so great if you're like me who doesn't. \n\nWhen we picked up Sophia, she did look cute. However, we quickly noticed that her hair was extremely knotted where her rubber bands gathered the bows on to the sides of her ears. In addition to that which was really bad, her haircut was completely uneven and choppy. It was bad and normally when I get her groomed, her under eyes are nice and clean. Her eyes where wet underneath and not thoroughly clean. Brook also went on to say that Sophia was uncooperative when she was being groomed but I've never had any complaints and she is after all, still a puppy. Needless to say, I was disappointed the more I looked at the job we paid for and I will definitely look for another groomer in the area.",0.0,0.9847011566162108
