I called a couple places (Home Depot and Lowes) and got price quotes for hot water heaters and replacement labor costs and then went on yelp to see if I could find a plumber with a good reputation that charged fair prices.\n\nI called Cypress Street plumbing at about 2:30pm today and spoke with George.  I told him where I was located and he said he could come right over.  Within 30 minutes George had made it to my place, diagnosed the problem, and was on his way to pick up a new water heater to install.  By 4:30pm, he had removed the old water heater,  installed the new water heater, and had the whole place cleaned up like nothing ever happened.  He didn't charge a service charge to come out and diagnose the problem and he warranties the work that he does.\n\nGeorge did a great job and really seemed like he knew what he was doing.  Everything is working perfectly now.  He was friendly and professional.  His cost was a little less than the quotes I got from Home depot and Lowes.  It was easy breezy working with him and I would recommend him.  Yay! I think I just found a plumber that I would call again!",1.0,0.9886783957481384

I tool off early from work to meet Mark at our house (2:00 p.m.). He took a look at the water heater and claimed that the screen under the water heater needed cleaning and tested the pilot light. Mark stated if anything went wrong to call him on his cell phone. 2 hours later the pilot light was out after taking a shower. I called Mark and no answer, left a couple of voice mails. I then called the company and received the answering service at 5:02 p.m. and was told that they would pass the information along to the office and it would have to wait until the next morning. I stated that I could not go another night without hot water and the response I received from the answering service was \""what do you want me to do about it\"". Mark then called back and told me he could not come out and I needed to text him the make, model and serial number of the water heater PLUS take a picture and send it to him of the control. I did and was told by Mark he would go purchase the part and only charge me for the part as I was not going to pay another service call fee as it should have been checked out and fixed the first time. My husband left work early to be home at 3:00 p.m. to meet Mark and when I called Mark to tell him, he stated he could not come as he had an emergency call and it would be at least 8 hours. I called the office and spoke to Lynn and explained the situation and told her this was not acceptable. She stated that she was aware of the situation and that they did not have anyone else working who could assist us, Mark was the only plumber working. Not even the owner/manager. Come to find out Mark was going to install a used part instead of a new one and his manager said no. The answer I received from Mark and was to keep lighting the pilot light until he could come back to our house which according to Lynn would not be until probably 2 days. This is was not good so I had to call another plumbing company to come out and pay another service fee call because they did not do what they were supposed to do or follow thru with what was promised.",0.0,0.9995594620704652

Where do I begin?.. I switched to Homelife Protection home warranty last Sept 2012 since my other Warranty co price was going to increase sharply and previous service call experiences were unsatisfactory. Today I called Homelife to get service ASAP due to Water heater not working since Saturday. I even submitted a claim online. Never recieved an email reply showing recieved and being handled ASAP. Called Monday morning and was advised they would have someone call me shortly and explained it may cost me an additional $850.00 for replacement of water heater if has to be replaced. Now in the details of what is covered it states they cover up to $500. for water heaters. I had already priced water heaters at 2 different places and found them priced from aprox $218.00 and up.  The warranty co had advised the installation and additional parts needed are not included and i would also still need to pay the $45.00 service call. I advised I had read that they can opt to pay us the $ instead for the replacement. Now this is where it gets interesting. The warranty advisor checked our acct and stated there had been NO Payments since Oct 2012.  I advised that's impossible since I was set up on Auto draft since acct set up last Sept 2012. I looked at my checking acct on line all the way back to Oct and found yes indeed that was last payment they drafted. How I hadn't noticed ..not sure. I asked why they had stopped drafting my acct and they claimed there was a \""general error code\"" and it effected not just me. I asked why didn't they contact me via phone and or email. They claimed they did try to call me. But somehow they had wrong phone # when I asked them to verify # they had been calling. I asked why they didn't email me then? They claimed \""we don't do that\"" then why do they keep my email on file in the 1st place? Hmmmmm. But they  were prompt to state they could take 2 months payment over the phone right then to resolve the issue. I told them NO Thanks! You've already shown your Incompetence as a Company and I will No Longer be doing business with them! \nNeedless to say I got a Brand New Water heater for just $259.00 today from an appliance store and my husband installed it per instructions. So the moral of the story is:\nA Home Warranty is Worthless and will cost you more $$ in 99% of the cases!..Especially one like HomeLife.",0.0,0.9988906979560852
