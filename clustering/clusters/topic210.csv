The waiter and all the bus boys provided excellent service.  We started off with the Grand Plateau which had raw mussels, oysters, clams, cooked shrimp and lobster.  It was soo delicious and I loved the presentation.  It was stacked on tiers and it had all these delicious sauces.  The seafood was extremely fresh and even though it was pricey ($110), its a good appetizer to split among a big party.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Daube de Bouef which was braised beef short ribs.  It came with potatoes, carrots, and fried bone marrow (which was very interesting).  When I eat short ribs, I expect them to just melt in my mouth, so I was kind of disappointed by the way it was cooked.  It just didn't have the flavor I expected from all the raves I heard about Bouchon.  The bone marrow was very interesting, it kind of just bursts in your mouth and its very liquidy, it tasted kind of like melted fat, which sounds gross but it was a good addition to the dish.\n\nI absolutely LOVED the macaroni au gratin which is similar to mac and cheese.  I love it when a restaurant makes a simple dish that just tastes so elegant and I liked how it was kind of burned around the edges of the dish.  I also got to taste some of Bouchon's french fries and I thought they were prepared very well too.  Overall I liked the sides more than the actual main part of the entree.  \n\nOf course their wine selection is amazing, we had a bottle of white wine and a bottle of a cabernet which the waiter selected for us.

They were both disgusting. First of all they use previously frozen mussels on the half shell so they don't exactly source the freshest ingredients. The mussels were tough and over cooked. I was picturing a light broth that was just enough to dip you bread in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the mussels. This is not what I got. I got mussels that were drowning in broth. I literally had to go fishing for my mussels since they were completely submerged in broth. The Hamburg style had no mushrooms as the waiter stated and the Portuguese style had no chorizo. The Portuguese style was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth. \nI also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto. These were sad and not good. The mushrooms were no joke the size of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice. Then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled. This was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over cooked and burnt. \n\nService here was also a disappointment. The \""dining room\"" was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley style kitchen. The kitchen is tiny, unkept, and in my mind better left unseen.

Today I tried their special of the day: steamed mussels in a coconut curry (I think) sauce. Delicious! Service is always very friendly. Wine list is short but well thought out. I have tried a couple of their nosh boards and the salad nicoise before and they were all very good. Next time I will try to leave some room for dessert!,1.0,0.9992526173591614

Both times I was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  They have a large rock pit? in the middle that they light when it's cold for heat.  \n\nI really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time I also had the spinach salad.  It was delicious!  Fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette.\n\nThe service is good, nothing special - but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops?  I just don't see how that is sanitary especially if they're walking in the kitchen.  \n\nOverall it was good and I'm sure I'll be back.  I keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 1/2 price appetizers!  A bowl of mussels and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is all I need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner.",1.0,0.9994865655899048

The space had a great tavernish atmosphere and we were seated right away even though we had expected to have to wait.\n\nWe had the fish cake, the scotch egg, and the mussels. The fish cakes (kind of like crab cakes but with fish) had strong smoke notes and was a bit salty. The scotch egg was done really well, crispy on the outside with a delicious meat layer and an oozing egg in the center. The mussels were well portioned for two people to share and were tasty. Didn't find a single closed shell in the bunch.\n\nOverall, I think the food was executed well and the service was friendly and prompt.

We started with Soup of the Day (which at this moment I can not remember, but was it was good!) and House Salad.  Both were slightly above average.  The main thing I liked about the House Salad was the dressing!\n\nThen we got the mussels in the Lobster sauce and braised short ribs.  Mussels were yummy and definitely be my choice if we came back.  The braised short ribs were a little disappointing.  It was cooked pretty well, tender and moist, but I didn't think the flavor was that good.\n\nThey also carry Anchor Steam beer here, in case you're a fan of the San Francisco brew.",1.0,0.8642410635948181
