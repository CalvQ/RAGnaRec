This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays, usually with one musical in the mix. There's new works here, like the original show The Chief, about what else, but Pittsburgh Steelers founding owner Art Rooney.  They bring in the classics like A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Important of Being Earnest.  They also have newer works right off Broadway, like The Rabbit Hole and Superior Donuts.  Plus, they bring in Second City every year, which is big in my book because they've spawned a couple SNL cast members!! \n\nI absolutely LOVE the theater!  I'm a big fan of a theater in the round.  That means there's seating on 3 sides of the stage.  They've also been able to do some really cool things with the stage/set, like making an actual pool for the show Metamorphoses.  My favorite all time show was The Secret Letters of Jackie and Marilyn, which was a world premiere.  The show was about a made up relationship between the two women where they wrote letters to each other.  It was a VERY cool concept! \n\nThey also do a lot of great events like the Mix at 6 for young professionals before a show.  Plus, they understand that most of us under 26 (and of course sometimes above) are broke ho's, they offer $15 tickets!  The great thing is, there's really not a bad seat in the house! \n\nAgain, we have a fantastic theater district, so TAKE ADVANTAGE and go here!  Don't make me tell you twice!!",1.0,0.9996510744094848

While the actors had to work at projecting, it was nice to have performers that didn't need to me miked. \n\nOverall, the experience was well worth it. There is something very special about being a part of an expanding theater company. I look forward to many more performances and watching this company grow.",1.0,0.995011568069458

The theater at the Bellagio Hotel is so beautiful, and the cushioned seats are much larger and much cozier than usual.  Call me weird, but seriously, those seats were super soft and comfortable and made me feel all different and happy!!  Overall the show that I watched on the Christmas Day of 2012 was not perfect but still very great!  Some minor performance mistakes took place like a performer dropping a small ball while she was throwing and playing with 10+ balls in her hands; she has done a great job anyways, and all humans can make mistakes, right?!  The best part of the show that I have enjoyed a lot and just cannot forget is the sand art!  The sand artist was all by herself on the stage creating all kinds of fabulous pictures on the sand table, which was super duper cool and ahhhhhhh-mazing!  Anyhoo, Zarkana is such a fabulous show that all Cirque du Soleil fans should not miss!  Go watch it guys!!",1.0,0.999583661556244

Seats were on the second level, center, provided a great view. I saw Elvis when it was still there and sat floor level but I thought either seat location provided good views of the stage. I think if you had seen the other productions in town, this one sort of pales in comparison. The set looked great, but most of the acts had been done in other Cirque shows before, and on a much grander scale. The parts that stood out for me were the tennis balls act and the sand artist, which, even that one I had seen similar vids of on youtube years before too. Nothing really stood out as exceptional though. Although I gotta agree with the seats in this theater, really really comfortable.",1.0,0.9884161949157716

Good thing we don't wait until the last minute for anything or we would've been late. Seats were comfy, although we were in the second row where there were no armrests making it easier cuddle, compared to the seats further back. People showed up late and obstructed views when they did show. Two guys in the front row were heckling/hollering and security did absolutely nothing. Everyone was taking pictures, one kid had his phone flashlight on when the scene required absolute darkness. Come on guys! I know this is Vegas and more laid back but if I'm gonna spend good money, I wanna feel like it's a special occasion and not matinee at the local theater. The show seemed to drag a bit, less fast paced than previous shows I'd been to. Kudos to all the performers who do amazing things but I feel they are probably not being compensated enough for the prices they were charging for this show.",0.0,0.9987069368362428

It is very narrow and very deep, so those without great seats are pretty far from the stage. We were seated in the middle, so it wasn't bad. The show was really really fun. They were naughty without being gross, campy without being lame, and talented! The music and singing were all done live, and the dancing was fun!

Its the sort of theatre that you get a little dressed up to go to, like people used to do back in the day. I was lucky enough to see a stunning performance of the Nutcracker here in January, which obviously is mostly attributed to Scottish Ballet but the theatre played a huge role also. Everything from the sound to the lighting was fantastic and it really was a magical evening. \n\nThere is a number of bars for you to have a quick tipple during the interval, but you have to be quick out your seat because it gets very busy fast. \n\nTickets can be expensive, but it really attracts some of the better quality shows so it is worth it and it really makes for a nice evening out.",1.0,0.9997387528419496
