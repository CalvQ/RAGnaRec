Coco's menu nice with lots of selections, nothing complex as far as offerings. Service here it gets really good! Basically a non-inolved staff, just putting in time with an attitude. Clearly our waitress didn't want to be at work. Kept breezing by saying our order is due up any minute....Finally arrives 45 minutes after taking our order. Stated it just came up on the serving table. Order was cold, slab of curled swiss cheese on my omlet, cold toast. We just got up and left. Before we left asked to speak to manager...Ha...explained situtation to another wait staff member...she blantly stated they couldn't do anything thats just the way it is...Don't waste 1 hour of your life..lots of other choices in the area....give Marie Callendars a try, right down the street.",0.0,0.9926286935806274

The dining areas were filled less than 50% capacity, and we were seated immediately in the patio next to the brass perimeter railing that afforded us a good view of the restaurant and the casino. \n\nMy wife ordered an omelet with mascarpone with a side of sausage, and I chose scrambled eggs and bacon with fingerling potatoes.  After a very long wait, our food arrived without the sausage.  Our waiter said the sausage was on its way and then he disappeared.  We started to eat, and after a very lengthy period of time I spotted our waiter heading our way with covered dishes.  I thought that one contained the sausage, however, he breezed past our table without a word and served a party next to us who had been seated well after us.  Before I could get his attention, he disappeared again.  We were just about finished with our food when our waiter reappeared.  I flagged him down and asked what happened to the sausage.  Without offering any regrets or apology whatsoever, he assumed an attitude of indifference and merely said that there was a mix-up in the kitchen.  He was then about to walk away, but I stopped him and stated that I wanted the cost of my wife's breakfast taken off the bill.  When the bill arrived, we were not charged for my wife's meal and nothing further was spoken between our waiter and me.  As to the quality of the food we did have, my wife's omelet was average.  It was the same for my food except the potatoes were very greasy and went mostly untouched.\n\nDue to the wholly unprofessional service as well as the mediocre quality of the food, I strongly suggest passing on Le Caf\u00e9 Ile St. Louis.",0.0,0.9922226071357728

The name comes from the apocryphal tale about the Earl of Sandwich (an actual position of nobility in the UK).  It was rumored that the Earl was gambling late into the night and in order to eat his meals at the table asked the chef to put the meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread. Voila, the sandwich is born.  Wikipedia doesn't mention this story and other sources on the subject say it's probably not true.\n\nNow you know why this place is called the Earl of Sandwich and why it's fitting that it's in a casino. \n\nThe lines for lunch on Saturday afternoon tend to be long, but it's worth it.  All of the sandwiches, wraps, and salads were $5.99.  I also had a coffee that brought my total with tax to $8.50 or so.  I ordered the Montagu, which had roast beef in it.  The roast beef was much better than I would expect from a sandwich shop -- it was very juicy and was actual slices from a roast and not the typical deli slices (which has the potential to be chopped and formed odds and ends from the butcher).  \n\nThe sandwich is smaller compared with with a Subway or Quizno's sub, but the quality is infinitely better.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap lunch (or late night bite since it's open 24-hours) I'd recommend the Earl of Sandwich.  It's at the entrance of the Miracle Mile shops at the Planet Hollywood, so you can make a quick entrance/getaway if you don't feel like getting sucked into a mall or casino.",1.0,0.9631043672561646

I'm not a big fan of sweet/salty but the cranberry was not too overpowering. It really complemented the delicious turkey. Speaking of turkey, this is not shitty average tasting turkey you find on the supermarket shelves. Earls' puts a big hefty serving of turkey that is layered very nicely and tastes even yummier. \n\nHighly recommend the creamy tomato soup.. had it again and it was just as good as the first time!

I came here with my family because it's close by my house and I seen there were pretty good reviews on Yelp.  Being a casino based resturant/grill I expected that the prices would be pretty good; however compared to other casino resturants in Henderson I was immedietly dissapointed with the prices.  Not that they were extremely high, but they were higher than I expected.  For around 6-7 I could get a great burger/fries at the RainbowClub whereas here it would cost about 9-10.  I went with Chicken Wings, Fries, ranch and a drink because wings are generally one of my favorite meals to eat.  They only had a few sauce choices to choose from so I chose the hot.  They were good wings, but nothing great at all.  Basically the same run of the mill sort of wings that anyone could make themselves.  The size of the wings was about average maybe even slightly below.  The fries and ranch were good.  This place is wierd in my opinion because you order at a counter before you sit down, almost like a fast food resturant.  They give you a cup and you get your own soda which I actually like, but I though that was unusual for a casino resturant of any kind.  My wife ordered a burger which she said was good, but it looked a bit small compared to the price.  I believe during this time of night there was only one server, but she did pretty well checking in on us but really with us getting our own drinks there wasn't much for her to do other than bring food.  Overall it just wasn't what I was expecting, with all the higher review scores I expected better food at a lower cost.  With all the money being made of gambling in the casino, I expected the prices for food to be better but that just wasn't the case.

The regular prices are bit up there, but I see what they're trying to accomplish in this place. It's suppose to be a more upscale \""bistro\"" type setting, but it really is kind of odd to me because its the Flagship (and ONLY) restaurant of the casino open at all hours. They really need a quick and cheaper options for food in the casino, IMO. They did add a $9.99 prime rib dinner which looked really good and huge. Which is smart to do because when in downtown LV, you cannot pretend to be a Bellagio and price your food that way, I don't care how new your casino is. You have to know who the clientele is. But on that note, the clientele at the Downtown grand were pretty much like me...we got money to spend but come on! Give me a $3 burger special! =) \n\nAt any rate. Service was really good, it's a nice sit down experience. The restaurant was not terribly busy at 7pm on Weds night.  Our burgers were good (juicy, generous with all the fixings) and we ordered a side of tater tots and Cesar salad as well. All was good and tasty.  I really liked my Cesar. \n\nIf you're staying at the hotel, this is a safe bet to try if you don't want to go anywhere else. Definitely get a players card so you can get the deals.  Would I come out of my way to just eat here? Not sure I would as it's Vegas, there's so many other ways and places to spend your money but if I'm in the area, sure. I'd give them another go.",1.0,0.9968563318252563

This place had a special for $38, it came with 1 appetizer (choice of Ceaser Salad, mac&cheese bites or tomato basil soup) Main (8oz fillet mignon or Cedar plank salmon) and desert-two big balls of donuts with chocolate and caramel. I got the Mac&cheese bites and the fillet mignon. all this for only 38 bucks!! the best deal i ever had, PLUS the food was AMAZING, the steak was cooked perfectly, rare + . Much better than any expensive steakhouse i've been. definatly must go if you go to Encore!!! I also had their cocktails (grape crush and some kind of fruit martini) which was also delicious!!",1.0,0.9995173215866088

After 11pm, there are certain menu items (marked with three red cups) that are available for $3.95.\n\nThe first time I came here was with a party of about 30 people.  The second time was with a party of nine.  Both times took a VERY long time to get seated.  This is obviously understandable for the party of 30, but not so much for the party of nine.\n\nAnyway, the food ranges from decent to very good.  Their sliders are okay, but I much prefer TGI Friday's sliders.  On the other hand, their country-fried steak is delicious.  I've also tried other people's dishes and overall, the food is on the upper end of the \""casino cafe\"" scale.\n\nIn short, this is a solid addition to my list of late night cafe destinations.",1.0,0.9980437755584716

She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu, which offers basic burgers, specialty burgers, salads, and tons of appetizers.

The burgers are only cooked two ways, pink or well-done.\n\nWe both really enjoyed our burgers, they were huge and very filling, but felt that the chili cheese fries were just okay.

Just to have a place to sit and eat. I understand that its located at Red Rock Casino, and of course a lot of people will probably think, \""It got to be good, since its at Red Rock Casino.\"" So lot of people will probably have high expectations of the place, and I bet you, not many of them will have their expectations met. \n\nAs for me, I did have some mix feelings about the place. It is a fancy looking cafe, located in one of the popular station casinos. So thinking, that it's in a fancier casino, pricing is probably a bit more then expected. But knowing that it is a 24 hour joint, the first thing I think of is, Denny's. Which brings the thought of food, that's fairly done, but not quite done the way you want it, or it's done, where you can't even stand touching it.  But you'll probably eat it, cause its edible, or that, you're really hungry, you'll eat anything.\n\nI had the Philly cheese steak, with fries. I loved how the sandwich was made and the bread was just right. But the french fries on the other hand, were kind of dry and crunchy. But again, I really don't expect much at a 24 hour cafe. There are some out there that does better, others are just average. Grand Cafe, is one of those average ones,  in a high end station casino.  \n\nI would recommend this, if you're only looking for a place to sit and eat. But, remember that you're at one of the high end station casinos, which may make it pricey, depending what you pick. Don't set your expectations to high, cause it is a 24 hour cafe, and the food is probably average for any kind of 24 hour diner out there.",0.0,0.9305628538131714
