This place is near my part of town so I drove down there on 05/10/2013 to get me started on vaping. When I walked in I was greeted then a girl went to help me. I told her that I smoke and wanted to start vaping. She showed me the most expensive kit and I told her I was on a budget and when I have enough money I'll eventually upgrade. She acted like \""come on buy the thing and go\"" type of look. As any first vapor would get I got the PSV 510 e-cig which looks like a cig. So she showed me how to fill it and the one I tried was working but she didn't check to see if everything works. I got home and tried charging my other battery so it will be set for when the one I'm vaping dies. The battery would not charge so the next week when I have money I go back down and tell them the battery was DOA and they acted like the lady who sold it would be talked to. Didn't happen anyway they replaced my battery and I bought a few more juices. A week later my battery won't work so I go back in with my receipt and the first thing out of the guys mouth is \""you can't keep bringing back batteries expecting to get a new one for free\"" at this point I felt like there was no respect or customer service. Even though I was dissapointed I bought their ego kit which was $70 I did get a free 6ml bottle of e-liquid. At this point I think I gave up going there to buy e-juice and other stuff. I did some research and I now been buying stuff online from other vendors. Now as far as juices it seems like pink spot don't have great tasting juices at all since I went to a different vendor. Pink spot juice is not that flavorful and their flavors fade. I'm just going to say this pink spot has a nice shop but as far as customer service it sux and is a poor attitude. There is only 1 person I would actually talk to and he takes his time and helps explain stuff.

After my first hit off the ego-c I knew I might have finally found what every other smoking cessation aid failed to give me. The experience was amazing, and I immediately purchased a starter kit. Even though the store was already closed Chris stayed an extra half hour (on a Friday night!) to take my system apart, educate me on the various pieces, help me in finding the right juice, and assure I was happy and confident with my purchase. Awesome first experience!! \nThe next week I went in almost daily with minor \""newbie\"" questions, but every time I was greeted with exceptional knowledge and unparalleled service. \nIf you are a current \""vaper\"" or at all interested in making the switch, I highly encourage you to check out Vapor Vortex. Their knowledge and customer service are a refreshing change and create a wonderful environment. Their prices rival anything local or on-line, and their products are all top of the line components. When it comes to e-juice, they stock over 80 different flavors, and are more than willing to let you try as many as needed to find your perfect fit. \nSo yeah, Vapor Vortex is on top of their game and truly are your one stop shop for e-cig supplies, juice, or just some honest and competent knowledge.

I'm tired of it...but I love it. This is the dilemma most of us smokers face. I've been toying with the idea of quitting since my 30th birthday, but haven't been able to pull it off. I heard about Scott and his store, Puff Vapors, from a friend, so I decided to check it out.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that this isn't your normal \""smoke\"" shop (or \""vape\"" shop, as it were): nice, fluffy leather couches, aromas of exotic fruits, and lots of friendly people socializing. \n\nBrandon, the gentleman behind the counter was friendly. I told him what I was there for and he gave me several options for a first time vaper (sp?). Soon, Scott, the owner came out and happily talked to me about the advent of vaping. I had lots of questions (is it safe? can I lower my nicotine in increments? Is it more expensive than smoking?). Scott answered these with an affirmative and even backed his answers up with Harvard studies! This a man who believes in his product and it shows.\n\nWe then ventured to the part of the counter where you can sample all his flavors. There are a ton! They even have a cigarette flavored one, which was very exciting for me because I don't really like all the tooti fruiti ones...just plain tobacco. By the way, they have a \""Cigaro Cubano\"" flavor which is delicious! Scott suggested that I get a flavor I'm used to and then something different that I can try. I chose turkish-menthol and coffee flavors. \n\nThey have a variety of different vaping apparatuses at varying price points, but since I'm new, I chose the starter kit, which comes with two of everything (flavors, rechargeable batteries, etc). It's $70 bucks. \n\nI also want to add that you can buy any of the flavors nicotine free which is nice.\n\nI'm sold. I loved this place. If you're trying to quit smoking, but can't seem to, this may be the option for you. Don't take my word for it though. Go see Scott. He'll be happy to tell you all about it.",1.0,0.9562788605690002

I advised that I didn't see any there but I know that they can be found at a very affordable price at Butt Out in central Phoenix. The nice lady said that they did in fact carry them as well. I decided that I wanted a couple 18350 batteries and a few replacement coils. The pretty lady told me that I needed to go see \""Bish\"" about the hardware. When I got \""Bish's\"" attention I told him that I wanted 2 12ml bottles of juice, 2 18350 batteries and 5 replacement coils for the iclear30. This guy looked at me like I had just spouted out inflammatory comments about his mother. The look he gave me was utterly disrespectful. He proceeded to tell me how he runs a juice bar and doesn't deal in hardware and why would he have something like that. Then gave me another messed up look and turned around and walked away. I assume he was getting the juices that I asked for. Another patron standing behind me asked me if that really just happened, if this store owner had just treated me that way.

He called me over because he wanted to see what kind of vape I had, and to my surprise he told me I had a knock off version of the Joyetech eGo C-Twist electronic cigarette. He showed me how genuine brands have the logo on the bottom, which mine didn't. I was astonished.

I'm wondering if they had bigger tester tips if the flavor would be better.\n\nNonetheless I settled on menthol.\n\nAs I was walking out, I noticed they didn't have any couch to sit on, just a round table with some chairs in the corner. I guess I was kind of disappointed there wasn't a better place to relax there, but maybe they don't want to do that.\n\nUltimately, I give this store 3 stars. I don't give out five stars unless the business blows my mind, so starting at 4 stars:\n- 1 star for having meh flavors / no bueno tester tips\n- 1 star for not having a better sitting area\n+ 1 star for phenomenal customer service & atmosphere\n\nAs always, I'll update my review the next time I purchase from there.",0.0,0.9923076629638672

I found myself on Flamingo and walked into this store and immediately noticed and felt a really good vibe.The owner Taga was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful to educate someone like me (who no longer smokes) what the hooplah of VAPE is all about. I notice he does builds for customized vapes and has a menu of flavors that can be tested if the customer requests. I learned that there are levels of nicotine in the juices that range from super low to high amounts. Its WILD that there are tons of people, especially in Las Vegas, who are dependent on smoking for sport who need serious doses of nicotine in their vape juice to equate to their 3 pack a day habit. I was in the shop when a few customers came in and was happy to see how well Taga spoke to each of them, treating them with Pacific Islander kindness (business with a true smile). This store has a good owner, a friendly appeal to it and a variety of product.

The reason prices here are a little above the norm for most shops is because the hardware is authentic and not a Chinese copy sold for 1/3 the price. The juice selection is pretty large although I am not a fan of one of the brands they carry... It is easily remedied by looking at the other brands they carry. If you need coils or a mod rebuilt they will work as quickly as possible to make sure you get exactly what you want.

Both shops have incredible juice made in Prescott.  I have ordered ejuice from many sites on the internet and visited a couple of other local shops but the juice at Vortex is by far the best I have had.  I absolutely LOVE the Cinnabon, Root Beer Float and my favorite is No Worries.  The vapor is incredible for an eRoll and the throat hit of 24MG has totally got me off the cigarettes.  I have not had a cig since August 6th and for the first time in 35 years am confident I will never go back to it. \n\nI plan to move down to 18MG then 12MG in 6-12 months.  Eventually 6MG then 0.  I like the flavors and because it looks so much like a cigarette sometimes I just hold it like one and that satisfies the question of \""now what do I do with my hands?\"".  \n\nI have tried everything to quit, hypnotism, acupuncture, some weird laser/breathing apparatus, cold turkey, patches, etc.  Although I am still ingesting Nicotene my breathing is 110% better, I can actually smell my hair, perfume and my teeth are getting white again.  Their ejuice is 50/50 that is 50% VG (vapor) and 50% PG as well as food grade extract for the flavors.  NONE of the other junk that is in regular cigarettes or the over the counter pretend ecigs.\n\nI have had to wash all of my clothes and get the carpet cleaned as my sense of smell has returned.  My taste buds are back too.  Not as excited about that as I do not want to put on weight but everything tastes soooo gooood.  So, my 2 cents is if you are tired of smoking, the expense, the sour smell, being ostracized and health implications, visit Vapor Vortex and get the 411 on this exciting much cheaper alternative. \n\nVaping Rules!!",0.0,0.9494882225990297

There were similar type flavors once you start trying them since they used the same flavorings in different combos to make some other flavors.

Some were good and others could be worked on. There were no testers, but there were bottles that he opened. He let me drip a few, even though they were 12 and 18 mg nicotine. I could handle them enough to get the flavor out out of it. But i usually don't enjoy it. he gave me a few testing bottles i found were good, Mint chocolate chip and Blueberry w/ Cream. \n\nAlso, there was this nice vape bag he was carrying in a showcase. It was a bit steep at 40 some dollars, but there's a lot of room for mods, juice and whatever you want in there. Built sturdy and i felt i could have one, of course if the price was right. Maybe down the road he will carry different bags for a more affordable price.\n\nOverall this place has a little room to improve, like their juice, or their testing station.

They are also very good at rebuilding your atomizer for you.... as they have a wealth of knowledge and experience on the matter.\n\nTheir juices are made of all natural flavoring and they are very particular about what goes into the juice, making sure that no chemicals that could be harmful in some artificial flavorings make it into their juices.... all ingredients are American made.... and fresh.\n\nThey are willing to mix custom flavors at any nic levels....\n\nThere really isn't anything negative I can say about them.... and I have been to some really crappy vape places, and some great ones.\n\nIt seems like the people who may have had bad experiences were very isolated incidents.... unfortunate, but isolated.\n\nThis is a great place to go for any of your needs.  It is very organized and clean, and they can help you out with anything you have going on.",1.0,0.9794772863388062

AWESOME! AWESOME!!!. As you can already see by the reviews for this shop that there are no bad reviews. For me and my wife we had been getting our E-Cigs online for the last three years because we could not find anything locally for an affordable price. We had just recently started up again so I went online to see what is out there. I ran across this quaint lil shop on YELP, and decided to give them a try, because all of the other shops had some pretty sad reviews. I am sooo glad I talked my wife into going. This place is great with the juice bar, friendly owners, and the best location to my home. We have purchased multiple items from them, and the quality is great. We no longer get our vaping items from China on the Internet. I hope they stay in business for a long time, so they can service our vaping addiction.\n\nI was concerned about the quality of the items I purchased, because half of the stuff I purchased online was faulty. E-cig butt cartridges would not work half of the time when I purchased them online. I would have to call India, and speak with someone that could not understand my Engkilish, just to be told they would send me a return mailer to send back the faulty items they sent me. So I inquired about that with the store owner and he advised me they have a 30 day warranty on the products they sell? Not much of a warranty I was thinking to myself. I guess he saw that on my face and proceeded to tell me that customer satisfaction is his number one priority and if something did happen to one of the products he sells to me, to bring it back and he would work that out with me. WOW! I did not expect that answer. \n\nSo far The two starter kits with the mini chamber and battery's with chargers have not failed, plus the E-Cig starter kit I purchased for my wife also have worked great. Anyone that is vaping for kicks, or is considering getting the E-Cig to use as an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes, or if you are trying to quit smoking altogether then this place is for you. Tell all your friends, your boss, your family, your neighbors, your dog, and email the President to let them know that this is the best place to shop in Arizona for everyone's Vaping needs.",0.0,0.7069969773292542

Kelly invited me over to the juice bar to sample the juices.  I was given a clean pre-packaged tip and was allowed to sample as many juices as I liked.  I asked her to make recommendations for me, and she did a wonderful job.  They carry their own JV house juices, Suicide Bunny, Golden Drops, and a few others.  The house juices are great and the selection of flavors is vast.  They are also always working towards inventing new flavors and are open to suggestions.  I chose the JV three (3), 10ml bottles for $25.  A great deal!  My juices were blended fresh, packaged up quickly, rang up and I was on my way.\n\nRainna assisted my friend with finding a new vape to replace her e-cig and she's very happy with the selection shown to her, the service, product, and price.\n\nIn addition to the machines and juices, they also do mods.  There are some beautiful hand decorated boxes and frames in the display cases, but I don't know if they are for sale.\n\nWe both definitely plan on coming back to this shop for all of our vape needs.

My piece of crap Circle K pen regularly spit liquid into my mouth and never charged right, even after the first use. Needless to say, I went back about 2 days later and bought my own. (In hot pink!)

I proceeded to the showcases.\n\nHip music was playing and there were about 5 people huddling around the showcases, a few were testing flavors and the others were asking questions about a few devices, and maybe 3 or 4 people sitting on the couches. I was helped soon after some people left. As I didn't even have a vape device yet, and i was new and still grasping some information, i asked what would be the best starting kit. The person who answered my questions was patient and friendly and honest. If i remember correctly he pointed out a starter kit with a flavor would come out to 70 to 80 dollars, i found that quite high and decided to look elsewhere for a kit. I did kind of feel out of place there as everyone but me and a couple other people were acquainted and friends.\n\nThis was just my first experience here. Couple other more recent times i've stopped by were still just ok, I stopped by before maybe 2 weeks ago to look for rba's specifically a nimbus or igo-w to upgrade from my igo-l i had recently bought. They didn't have any in stock so again, i looked elsewhere. I came back another time just for flavors, which was recent. I was and still am a menthol lover. so i ended up buying cheshire for i believe either 10 or 12 dollars i don't remember, but it's average pricing.\n\nOverall the service can be good, the people who helped me were patient and friendly, they do tend to leave and do something else though, until i ask again or someone else, but other than that, it's ok.",0.0,0.9860286116600036

He then pointed out this vape is a complete knock off after showing us their display and what looked to be a nicer version of what my boyfriend has. We've pretty much chucked it up as a loss since I know they don't want to hear it from us. I get it, it's retail business but selling people JUNK should be a crime.\n\nI've come into this location and mentioned that my vape has a burnt taste to it. I was then told I was vaping \""too long\"" and that's why I get that nasty taste. So I started counting how long I use it, each rip.  I also clean it vigorously with a Q tip and make sure the tank isn't leaking AGAIN, which it does frequently.  I've been replacing my tanks over & over until I finally stopped using it for a month or so out of frustration.  THAT and the fact I know from reading previous reviews they don't want to own up to anything or help anyone. FINE!  I rather take the $75 loss and take my money else where.\n\n I should of known the day this guy barged into the shop yelling about how they sold him a $300 dollar piece that was JUNK. This guy was livid, ranting about how he owns his own vape shop where he's from and he paid a taxi driver $60 bucks to get there from the vape convention that was going on.  I thought the guy was crazy.  After finding out my bf's piece is an $80 CLONE? I'm in disbelief they could do that knowing we were looking forward to coming back and spending good money.  Super pricey, won't recommend it to anyone I know ever again.",0.0,0.99948251247406

So in my opinion, this isn't a bad thing, nor is it a good thing. For those who want to quit cigarettes, yes you get the full satisfying flavor and throat hit you can ask for, it's not expensive per say(as they sell replicas and clones), but it might be a little over someone's budget to just see if it'll really work for for them to kick the cigarettes.\n\nThey have 10 to 12 flavors, all of which are sweet. I don't mind this, but someone looking for a good tobacco or subtle flavor might think otherwise. Since i drip my juices, i sat down and tested the sample bottles. The way Dope Vapor lets you test their flavors are also by using a mech mod and rda, which is awesome because everyone knows or should know dripping brings out the flavor a lot more compared to a basic clearomizer that i see often in many other shops. Also, at the time the nicotine levels they carried were 0,3 and 6mg, most common levels for dripping. I personally like Pure Luck and Chronic Melons so give those a try if you stop by.\n\nThe person i spoke to during my visit is chill and laidback. We talked about unique coil builds he was working on and also about juices he was experimenting with. I enjoyed my time talking and tasting juices.\n\nPrices are good, i bought 5 juices and it came out to $25 + tax. the juices are 10ml each so 50ml for $25 isn't shabby at all for being local. Their clone mechanical mods are decently priced, not too sure of what manufacturer they carry though. But some of them seem to be from DHgate or FastTech not too sure.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience. Staff is friendly, the shop is simple but effective. I get the fact he eliminated the starter kits so someone doesn't make the mistake of buying cheap starter kits, but maybe someone out there doesn't like big and bulky devices, or doesnt want to spend 100+(guestimating since you need a battery, charger, mod, rba and juice), and end up not liking it. Just my opinion of course. 4/5 stars Keep it up guys.",0.0,0.5451595783233643

So I didn't really know anything about vapping or the like. Manny (the gentleman working) explained everything to me and answered all my questions. He explained the difference between a start up set and the modded sets. He was a huge help and I will be stopping back by whenever I need questions answered. \n\nOn top of all that they seem to make their own liquids at the shop which is awesome. It's unique and helps set this shop apart from basic shops. \n\nI highly recommend coming by this shop and I will definitely be stopping by here more often!,1.0,0.9994422793388368

The owner Ben and his manager Chris are extremely knowledgeable and more than willing to help out with anything. They will even drill out air holes in the tanks for you. Great juice selection as well. One of my favorite things is about this place is the ambience. There is very nice Asian inspired art everywhere and has a very \""Zen\"" feel to it. I would highly recommend this vape shop to anyone.",1.0,0.9990744590759276
