I've been here multiple times over the past 4 years of living in the neighborhood. But, yet again, customer service has driven me away. A few years ago, the manager steered me in the wrong direction which led to my purchase of $100 of chemicals that went down the drain, and then admitted his wrong doing in the subsequent visit after I confronted him, but only after I confronted him. He made it right by providing more chemicals on the house after some reluctance...This was 2 years ago.\n\nOn a more recent visit, I encountered a young lady. She was very nice, chatting with the people in front of me for 15 minutes while I waited in line to have my water tested. She did not acknowledge my presence and continued to chit chat with them. Granted, I was the only other person in the store, so I brushed it off. She then proceeded to have an attitude with me like I had done something wrong. Today, this young lady was working again, and again, was helping another customer..perfectly happy go lucky. When it became my turn to check out, I requested a price match to leslies.com for some shock as it was a few bucks cheaper. She then proceeded to tell me the SKU was different and that she could not. Now I understand this is a corporate policy, but it's the same exact product. And I wasn't asking for a 50% discount, it was $3. Seriously? At that point, she picked up an attitude with me. Same type of attitude she had the previous time. As a customer, I felt disrespected with her general attitude and lack of understanding. I could care less about the $3. I will not be returning to this Leslie's. I'll take my money to another Leslies or to NPS.",0.0,0.9966161847114564
