I made a reservation for a party of two at 7:30 PM on a Tuesday night during the off-season. When I arrived I was told I would be seated shortly and that tables were just being cleared off. Instead, we waited for 30 minutes and were forgotten about. It was only after I went to speak with a different hostess that they seemed to have remember we were waiting and then we were seated within 10 minutes. So approximately a 40 wait past the reservation, which I find to be unacceptable for such an established restaurant. \n\nAs for the food, the quality was second to none. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the domestic Wagu strip steak. He thought it was the best steak he has ever had and is a big steak fan, and I thought for a steak house especially, that the salmon was great. Both dishes were cooked perfectly to order. The sides were AWESOME. We got the potato puree, vegetables, potatoes, and a few other things. Portions are HUGE and easily share-able. Also the bottle of red wine which was approximately $90 was very good and complimented the meal well. The server was very friendly, attentive, and knew a lot about the menu and suggestions/parings. \n\nOverall great experience and great food.",1.0,0.9976776242256165

I'll get to that later. \n\nBread basket was yummy.  I had to seriously control myself from getting full off the delicious croissants. \n\nSeasonal tasting menu = amazing.  Be prepared for a 2+ hour dinner.  Fairly small plates but you will be FULL after finishing all 11 courses.  Highlights: foie gras parfait,  hamachi, foie gras, and quail.  Loved the order in which each dish was served.  These courses will make you foie gras-LOVER.\n\nUni Pasta - The pasta was cooked perfectly.  Chewy in the middle.  Uni was fresh.  Only downside was the sauce.  It was extremely salty which came as a bit if a shock, but I'm sure it was a mistake?  Everything else was seasoned perfectly is why this threw me off. Half star off for that. \n\nDecor is beautiful.  It's a fairly small restaurant with a glossy black/red interior with an open kitchen.  Parties of one or two will most likely be seated on the counter - which I love!  You get a front row seat view of beautiful culinary creations being made.",1.0,0.9943476319313048

However, after the dining experience, I can say that either the people who have dined at Stack have it wrong, or maybe the staff have realized their faults and have worked to better the service.\n\nHaving said that, I made reservations for 9:30pm. The reservationist politely informed me of the dress code (business casual) and that my reservation would be held for a maximum of 15 minutes if I didn't show up (standard.) We showed up at the restaurant fifteen minutes prior and waited a few moments in the lounge area while they set up our table. The seats they gave us were in the back corner, very private and it really set the mood for the evening--it made me feel like an important guest of the restaurant rather than just another Vegas visitor. \n\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye--which was amazing. The portion was huge, but it was so delicious. It came with a choice of two dipping sauces as well, but the steak was juicy enough on its own to where it didn't really need it. My girlfriend and I shared the spicy crab and rice appetizer (amazing--it's kind of like a spicy crab roll but the rice was deep fried-ish.) She also got the seared tuna with ponzu sauce as her entree, which was also very generous in portion.\n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely go back. It has the lounge atmosphere for those just wanting apps and the \""dinner\"" atmosphere for those who are looking for something nice, but not nice to the point that you can't relax.",1.0,0.9894309043884276

Even though we made a reservation, between waiting for the hostess to appear and sitting at the bar, we had to wait about 15min for them to \""put our table together\"". I was disappointed to see that when we were finally taken to the dinning room we had been seated at a booth. For a group of four guys, this isn't an ideal seating situation. \n\nIn the end, the food and wine made it easy to overlook the poor service at the hostess station.

When you are spending around $100 a person the service should be exemplary. Certainly not the case here. I am a Vegan, so I ordered the broccoli, it literally came out with two partial heads of broccoli (not cut up at all) needless to say I had to cut all of the pieces myself while my colleagues looked at the monster head of broccoli and just giggled. I will certainly pass on the broccoli in the future. The bread dipped in marinara was yummy- but again it's pasta- just pasta...nothing that special. Seriously the Olive Garden makes a marinara sauce that might even be better. I would never go back.

The menu presentation is current and unique and the bread tray was delightfully unexpected in design. I ordered the seafood risotto, a dish I had been eyeing leading up to my restaurant visit. I love how the spice/ garnish tray complimented my meal, with mini bowls of capers, red chili flakes, pesto, and grated Pecorino Romano. The dish was the right combination of savory and salty and truly satisfying as I hope it would be. Very minor detail of the night that could use improvement - filling my water glass.

I'm comparing the Hearthstone platter to smith and wollensky on the strip, which for the same price blows it out of the water! I was a little put off with price to food ratio, but the chef sent out a few complimentary dishes, which I felt made the platter a little more palatable. The steak tartare was to kill for and the pizza was amazing too.  I love the draft beer selection and the shuffle board tables.  Overall, despite the reservations and the over priced seafood platter I will be back.  We actually tried to make reservations for last night, but we're told they were full.
