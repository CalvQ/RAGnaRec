I was super excited.  My grandmother and Iare on a family plan together and she lives in Tucson.  She mailed me my phone and was told that I can just go to a Sprint Store up here and have it activated.  I took my phone into this store and the associate, I think his name was John, told me in order to access the account, he needed the pin # or the answer to the security question.  I didn't know either and I used the store's phone to call my grandma (since sprint had turned off my service a couple days before) and my grandma was giving me a lot of answers that were not the right ones.  I was really upset and couldn't believe that this was so difficult.  I asked to speak to someone else and he said that they would tell me the same thing.  At this point, I'm the only customer in the store and two other associates are wandering around and I know they can tell I'm upset.  Neither of them came over and offered to help at all....He told me that my grandmother had to call customer service to reset the password.  Well, that's a whole other story.  Well, at the end of the day when I met up with my husband (after he had a few beers) he took my phone played around on it for literally less than a minute and magically, it was activated.  \n\nI can't believe that this person is in customer service.  He is an idiot and should be fired.  When I was extremely upset, he showed no emotion at all and couldn't help me at all.\n\nThe next day, my husband and I went into this exact same sprint store, to get my contacts transferred over and I just wish that guy had been there.  We did however, let one of the managers know of the situation the day before.  I'm not sure if anything will be done about it.\n\nIt's best to avoid this store.",0.0,0.9989722967147828

(another up-sell item) based on the reps pitch of it being \""protective and  shock resistant and able withstand drop damage.\"" \n\ntoday my phone fell from the waist band of my scrubs and hit the sidewalk STILL INSIDE THE \""PROTECTIVE\"" CASE and shattered. when i took it in for help was told that an insurance claim was my only option. i asked for a manager to discuss at least a refund on the faulty case i was told that there was nothing wrong with it. i explained that the \""protective\"" case wasn't that protective and that it was sold as something it clearly wasn't. ...no dice.\n\nmy next phone, i will buy online. as every other piece of equipment or accessory i need.

I got the worm in the apple in this case, so I felt it right to warn others. \n\nI purchased the iPhone 6 on day one. The staff member who took the order spent 15 minutes with me to get things going. Since that day, I have spent hours in the stores, and in the phone, with Apple staff trying only to get what I paid for. I have been given a new phone because my first one was proven to be faulty, but was not compensated for the additional cellular network charged that Apple themselves told me was the fault of their product. I was given a letter from Apple that said their device was guilty of runaway data usage. They told me to take this letter to my carrier and ask my carrier to reverse the additional data charges because it was Apple and not me that caused it! My carrier, of course, told me that they would not reverse the charges.\n\nYesterday, I went to Chandler fashion mall to the Apple Store to ask a few questions that I had regarding the new phone.

I took option number two...\n\nJoshua was assigned to me. I watched as he told the person he \""had me covered\"" and then proceeded to walk around without talking to me or anyone else. Then he walked over and told me that he would be a couple more minutes. I watched as he walked twenty feet away from me and stood motionless for a couple minutes waiting for something much more important than me. It never came, so he proceeded to walk around the store without even talking to anyone. Then he came back, and approached a fellow employee who was standing beside me. He asked him to help me with my questions and left. The other employee couldn't help me as he was ACTUALLY HELPING his customer. Joshua left again and tried looking important, all the while not talking to another customer or staff member.\n\nFinally, the original person who told me to wait two minutes went up to Josh and pointed my way. I appreciated this as I had been waiting about 10-15 minutes already, and Josh hadn't spoke to me or anyone else the whole time. I then heard Josh tell her that he \""had me covered\"" again. I walked over to him and reassured him I was definitely NOT covered. I left without any face time or questions answered.\n\nI hope Joshua experiences the same level of service in his life as he gives others in theirs. That is my hope for him.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has a good product in my opinion.

My parents use Sprint because it's about the only phone with reception in Beverly Hills but I thought their phone selections were pretty janky over the years that I went with AT&T. I guess recently they started to make a change to one up the other companies.\n\nI am tired of my iPhone.  It's issues with iTunes and being a sync nazi and dying on me short of 2 years is pretty BS. My mom has a HTC Evo and also has an iPhone. SHe told me that she prefers her Evo and Sprint and that she was not happy with her iPhone 4. It was something I thought about and it opened doors to consider other options.\n\nAT&T is an okay carrier (really who is truly 100% happy with a corporate business services? ), but I needed a change of phones and some interesting phones landed with other carriers. We came to test phones (primarily the HTC Evo and the Samsung Epic) and to ask questions. \n\nIt was nice to discover that switching gave us more for about the same price. I mean the 450 minutes here count for landlines- AT&T is for daytime to non AT&T users. Unlimited data and text with the 450 is $69.99 + $10 for 4g, $7 for insurance. They also informed us about discounts through our work- I get 17% off and the BF gets 18% off our plans. They also looked up our address to show the coverage for cell reception and 4g in our area and it was nice to see we were in a solid zone (I'd hope so with a cell tower 3 blocks away). \n\nOverall, I thought people were pleasant here. I put in a order online instead of buying from the store since a deal was going on for the HTC Evo for $99 through Dell, but the information we got in the store made us want to switch over. Time will tell if we will enjoy Sprint, but I think so. It's not a fucking iPhone so I'm kinda already pleased with the purchase.",0.0,0.9934796094894408

Since I got the Samsung Stratosphere in November, 2011, I've had to replace it three times prior to today.  Once was because I kept dropping it, so, yes, I realize that's my fault, but the two other times were because the phone is dumb: from the battery not holding a charge, to it getting hot, to dropping texts, to shutting off by itself, etc.  Well, guess what?  It completely died on me this morning, just stopped working altogether.  How am I supposed to check-in on Yelp and creep around on Facebook without my phone?!  So, I made the trek, again, to Verizon in my 'hood.  I've always gotten great customer service there and no one ever treats me like I'm crazy, even though this is now the FOURTH time I've had to get another replacement.  It turns out that Patty, who helped me today, had to replace her Droid seven times, so she feels my pain.  If I have to replace my phone seven times, I'm going to cry.  Patty did her best to resuscitate the phone, looking for batteries in the cupboards that would fit mine (none), charging it (I tried that), following the instructions on how to do a hard reset, but to no avail.  I greatly appreciated the valiant effort--she empathized and it means a lot to someone desperate.  Oh well, my new (likely refurbished) phone is supposed to come tomorrow.  Until then, as in the days of yore, I shall just have to rely on my laptop to keep me abreast of what my friends are up to.

The Galaxy III is $148 at Walmart and $200 at Best Buy. The Motorola Droid X is $79 at Walmart and $148 at Best Buy. Buying the phone is $100 cheaper at Walmart. Screen protectors are approximately $8 at Walmart where they are approximately $20 at Best Buy. Best Buy is not the best buy.\n\n  As far as purchasing the phone, sales Associate Michael was friendly. He did not overdo it with the Best Buy card. There was sufficient sales help on the floor. Best Buy could also improve the smart phone shopping experience with demos. \n\n  I give Best Buy an additional star for their 14 day warranty program.

I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all.

I'm like, what?!?!?!

She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new \""plans\"" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider.

Yes, Sandra (Sandy on her name tag) the manager, would not honor the agreement Verizon Customer Support had ensured me would be no problem.

They apologized to me and told me they could not do anything on their end because the manager of the store, Sandy, had final say. I ended up ordering the phone with Verizon Customer Support.

That happens at every cellular store that's good. Didn't mind that. Got greeted, the guy was great (who I will not name cuz he was nice even tho he conned me). So he pushes the Verizon edge plan which I don't mind cuz it's the same monthly bill. Cool. I trade in two iPhones which I want to put towards a new smartphone they're running a promo where I get $200/phone which was great! But sadly I was conned as the associate used up all my credit which was supposed to go towards the phone on merchandise. I asked repeatedly if my credit can go towards my bill or the phone itself, he kept saying don't worry your bill will be the same this merchandise is discounted. Awsome, I don't mind the phone case, car and travel charger, but a $200 portable speaker? I asked if the credit could go to my bill instead. Nope it doesn't work like that, then again \""how bout the phone?\"" Again nope. I said why did you tell me the promo was towards the phone then? Oh it is I made sure your bill was the same. Ok then put the $200 credit towards the bill. After continuing on this cycle I finally got fed up and said just do what you got to do. I'm done. So I got some overpriced gear from my iPhone trade in and was definitely unsatisfied with the unwillingness to put any credit towards my bill or phone like I wanted. Looking back I shouldve got a manager involved but I thought,what the heck, I'm getting $400 in merchandise for my two iPhones. Beware the salesman.",0.0,0.9985297918319702

Their policies on returns are crooked at best. And they are always trying to up-sell you something you don't need or will negate the manufacturers warranty as I recently found out when I paid top dollar (cash) for my HTC EVO.

My cousin had the same problem and was getting no where with Sprint and contacted HTC and they stated that the extended battery wasn't standard for their phones and not covered by the warranty and should be removed. I informed Sprint and they claim HTC authorized them to sell this battery on their behalf and I said then why does it say Sprint and not HTC? No answer.  Then I also posed the question as to why my Sprint HotSpot gets interrupted when I was told by the salesman all calls and text would be blocked. The manager tells me it only works if the 4G NETWORK is engaged. I was told it works no matter what! Also another lie! I told her I can barely get 4G to work and she said it isn't available everywhere. I said you advertise it is. That is why I bought the stupid phone and service this way and your salesman assured me this was the best way to consolidate services. I hate being lied to! They wouldn't give me my money back but gave me a bill credit. Not acceptable considering all the trouble and time wastes going back and forth to the Sprint store to get a working phone and resolution. You wait for hours only to be dealt with like you are the stupid one and insulted over and over again. I told the manager I have a big mouth and I would Yelp, Tweet, Facebook, and just shout to the roof tops about what a joke Sprint is and then save enough money to switch to AT&T or somebody until they piss me off and I have to switch again or just go back to a good old fashioned land line!",0.0,0.999542474746704

I asked her if I went to T-mobile & signed a new contract with them if I could keep my same number.  She said, \""I believe so.\""  My response...\""Merry Christmas\"" and I walked out.

Well, I took the bait and ended up with an extra line I didn't need and actually INCREASED my bill by $20-30 a month instead of reduced it, like I was told. I tried to cancel after the first month and my bill was ridiculous however it was outside of the 14 day return policy and I had to pay an extra $150 to do so!!   \n\nWell, silly silly me decided to go back since I needed a new phone and they are the closet store to me....... bad idea!!   \n\n2) I just purchased a new phone 13 days ago from this store and they refuse to return in even though the phone clearly has internal issues and registers touches all over the screen at random given moments - making emailing business clients impossible since it sometimes sends messages or types things I didn't ask it to do.

I've been a Verizon customer for almost 11 years now and I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service I received today by a particular rep. I did not get his name unfortunately.\n\nThis is a newer location close to my home and I was excited to finally upgrade to a newer phone. However, I ultimately changed my mind on doing so at this store because of the sales rep I encountered. Perhaps I expect more bc I was a sales rep for 6 years and I can see thru the B-S, but I think most folks would have felt a similar level of annoyance based on the exchange.\n\nThis was an easy sale for him. A cake walk. I was about to spend whatever $ to upgrade my phone and all the necessary accessories including a car charger, phone case and screen cover because I was ready to do so. Of course I'm not aware of their commission structure, but it's fair to assume he would have made $ on the sale. \n\nPositives-Store was clean, new, and well set up. My mom worked with a pleasant, friendly sales rep the day prior so I know they do have good reps working there. \n\nNegatives-Rep I worked with today never attempted to inquire/learn about my need as a customer. That's sales 101 my friends. He was more interested in spouting out the bells and whistles about the droid than actually listening to his customer. I could care less about a super duper top of the line pimped out phone-I've been using my LG for years now without a front that works properly, but to me, a phone is just a phone and it was time to upgrade to a basic newer phone with the credit I had.\n\nI asked several times for a comparison between the iphone 4 and the droid. He did give basic differences which I appreciated. I learned that you don't get to service your iphone at Verizon stores, you have to go to the apple store. That was a helpful piece of information. However, when I asked about accessories and details about a screen cover he stared at me blankly and sarcastically responded \""it's a screen cover.\"" He lost the sale there. Obviously I'm competent enough to know it's a screen cover, I was asking about other features it offered and the different ones available. He also wouldn't give my Mom and I space/time to review the info ourselves, he hovered the entire time.\n\nPerhaps I just caught him on bad day, but I was taken aback by his approach, clear sales pitches and dis-ingenious nature.

Shortly was 20 minutes later. \n\nI understand they had difficult customers who couldn't make up their mind and had to be talked through the phone buying process. But really? I hope we were an exception. \n\nThe sales person who we finally did see was very nice, and he apologized for the wait. We had my new phone in hand and paid for in about half an hour. \n\n** Just a side note though because I have not had an upgrade in a couple of years, but does anyone else know about/think is crazy that Verizon now charges $30 to upgrade? Even if the phone is free you still get charged $30 on your next bill. I think it's stupid and plan on calling customer service to see if I can get this taken off.

The phones here are less expensive than going to an actual Verizon store or ordering through Verizon on line. This makes it worth going here. We paid $50, but will get it back through a rebate. The same phone at Verizon would have been $100 minus the $50 rebate, making it a $50 out of pocket cost!\n\nHowever, the first time I went in, the woman made it very clear to me that the style of phone I was choosing would require no money down at all and no rebate to process. The next day when she was gone, the story changed.\n\nAlso, we had no idea we were dealing with a store that is not really a Verizon store, since the words \""Go Wireless\"" are not predominant in their signage. So there are TWO contracts that you sign - one with Go Wireless and one with Verizon! \n\nWe didn't realize this until we got home, because when you sign the contract electronically, it is not even printed so you can read it! When we got home and looked through the paperwork, we were very nervous about what we had signed.\n\nWhen my husband read that there will be a $30 upgrade fee which will appear on our Verizon bill, he blew a gasket, since the salesman hadn't mentioned this. He called to talk to  the manager who convinced him that that is a charge from Verizon which applies to every one of their customers. I did verify that through Verizon customer service.\n\nMy advice to other customers: Take heed, the sales people are fuzzy  about the fees and rebate information which will affect you. Ask for a printout of the contract before you sign so you can ask about all that the salesman forgot to tell you. If you are willing to go through this extra diligence, I think you will save enough money that it will be worth it.",0.0,0.9985785484313964

So I guess, that should be enough indication that this place is to be avoided like the plague. Personally, I feel guys like these should not be allowed to be in business.\n\nMy LG G2 (7 months old) suffered a hairline crack on its screen and I decided to get it replaced at this place. The reasons why I opted for this guy was that this place was pretty close to where I lived and that he had pretty good ratings for Apple repairs. I repeatedly mentioned that it was a TMobile phone and that I wanted an exact replacement. He said it'll take a day. The next evening when I walked in, he nonchalantly handed over the \""repaired\"" phone.\n\nOne look at it and I could sense that there were too many things that were wrong. The perimeter of the phone's case had been scratched as if a dog had clawed at it. The screen had a big \""verizon\"" sign on it. The so called replaced screen had, at both sides gaps wide enough where I could insert my finger nail in between the touch screen and the case. I was aghast and asked him what went wrong. He ever so casually said that his \""technician\"" had done it and that he did not have anything to do with it. I said I wanted it fixed right away to which he replied that his \""technician\"" was on leave and that I had to wait 2 days for him to get back. He himself could not take up what the other guy had worked on, apparently.\n\nSo I went it this evening expecting the worst, and I wasn't disappointed. It looked like some 2 year old had tried mending the earlier mess ups. My phone had super glue stuck on both the sides to cover up the gaps between the touch screen and the casing. The scratches were STILL there and to add insult to injury this time, HE COULD NOT EVEN GET THE BACK CASE TO FIT IN PROPERLY!!!! And the guy had the audacity to tell me that he could not figure it out!!!!\n\nIf I could, I would've attached pics of his \""WORK OF ART\"" and let you be the judge!! For this kind of shoddy work, he should have refunded me $640 - the money I spent on the phone. Instead he still charged me $100 giving me a \""generous discount\"" of $20.\n\nNot once did he take ownership of the issue, blaming it on a non existent \""assistant\"". He runs the damn place, but could not even muster the courage to stand up  to a customer and say that he had messed it up and that he would at least not charge me since he caused so much more damage to my phone!! \n\nI'm NEVER going back.

Needing the phone fixed, having just driven halfway across town, and wanting to be accommodating, I agreed to allow him to replace the defective new part with a used part so long as it worked.   The used LCD worked for three days then just went black in mid use.   I called Muhammad immediately and explained what had happened.

We were leaving to travel in Central America for a year and my phone had just died. Hence the haste and the need for a global unlocked phone. Though I realize that buying a used phone means some features are broken, they said the phone checked out. So I was very disappointed to discover that the GPS (50% of the reason I needed the phone) didn't work, the headphone jack didn't work, the back camera was missing a lens, and the front camera didn't work at all, and some other little things. So this is a phone that checked out for being fully functional?\n\nNow that I am back in the US, I bought a US SIM. I can't activate the SIM because there's a lost/stolen alert on my phone (interesting that wasn't a problem in Cen. Am.). So now I have a phone that I bought as a legitimate phone for $150 that I can't use. There are websites where you can check the phone to see if it is stolen. You'd THINK a store that deals in used phones would do that. NOPE. I trusted them. I was burned.\n\nAnd now that I'm trying to contact them again, their phone number doesn't work and they're not responding facebook messages. Thanks, Clarence of Unlocked Global Phones.
