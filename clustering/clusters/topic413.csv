One of the things I love most about having froyo is getting tons of fresh fruits to top it off, but the most disappointing thing at Yumberi were their selections of 'fresh' fruits.  Maybe I came at the wrong time?  Most of the fruit selections were more than half empty and looked like they've been out for a while.  I opted for blackberries and mochi (unfortunately this too was a bit dry) since the options were limited for my taste.

The peanut butter on the other hand was sour. Not sure if it had gone bad or it was supposed to be that way. My boyfriend got the salted caramel which cam out of the same machine as the peanut butter and said it was sour too. Love the decor and the guy behind the counter was super nice. However, I'll stick to my favorite fro-yo spots around town from now on.",0.0,0.517295241355896
