But I had to see for myself and here's my thoughts.\n\n-Beef Patty:  I didn't have one for myself, but I did sneak a bite or two from the GF.  When I first heard beef patty, I was thinking a hamburger type patty.  I was wrong. A beef patty here is actually quite different.  A Jamaican beef patty resembles a beef empanada.   I thought it was pretty good, the crust was flaky, and the beef was tasty.  If I wasn't trying to eat clean, I would have gotten one for myself.  \n\n-Jerk Chicken:  This is was my meal and it came with a plate full of rice.  I cheated and had a couple of spoons of the rice and it was the bomb.  My only wish...I wish could have eaten more.  The Jerk Chicken was as expected...tasty, spicy, and moist.  What?  Did I just say moist?  The Jerk Chicken reminded me of a Flip dish called Chicken Adobo, but with a kick to it. My suggestion is the Jerk Chicken. I want me some Jerk Chicken right now!!!\n\nThe restaurant itself is a little small.  Since it wasn't too crowded, our party of 6 ate comfortably.  Your food also takes a bit to get prepared and served, but that's how it's suppose to be here.  Not sure how many cooks in the kitchen, but they do take their time.

All spice and no depth of flavor. Ordered the jerk chicken plate and the goat curry- and you could tell that both meats were indeed chicken and goat, but the similarities between the high quality versions of these dishes we've had elsewhere and what we actually received, was sad.\n\nThe jerk chicken was, for starters, dry. Rub seemed to be applied sparingly, and there was only flavor where you got seasoning. Good portion, but not necessarily good value. \nGoat curry sauce had a good consistency to it, and the meat was good, but the flavor was simply lacking- lacking depth, lacking that finger-licking jamaican flavor I'd come for. \nSides included a mixed veggie type dish that was overcooked mush, and \""rice and red beans\"" consisting mostly of rice and of a few scant red beans (I counted maybe 10) that appeared to be dried. When even your sides are underwhelming, there's a problem in the kitchen.\n\nThis was one of those rare times when the BF and I didn't finish our orders.

I guess they've moved a ways down the street to 2010 E Broadway since there is another creole/caribbean restaurant in the place it used to be. Anyway, the parking at this place is behind the building and it's not paved, so I drove behind the building to park and there was a group of guys just standing back there hanging out. I was almost afraid to get out of the car, but I did anyway and went around to the front to go inside. The place was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon, there was just the owner's kids sitting watching TV. The lady at the counter was not very friendly, which is what warranted the three stars instead of the four stars I would have given them since the food was really good. I had the curry goat (my favorite) which came with cooked cabbage and rice and peas, and a beef meat pattie. The portion was HUGE! Enough for two meals.

I have to admit this small establishment was just about on of the fanciest  of the Jamaican restaurants I have visited in north america. This doesn't usually bode well with me because, from my personal experience, the fancier the restaurant, the more they stray from the authenticity of the cuisine by trying to please the american palate.\nWe eschewed the nouvelle cuisine menu items obvious there to please that crowd and  ordered the Escovitch Fish and Jerk Chicken since my favourite \""ox-tail\"" was nowhere on the menu and that is the dish most jamaicans use to test the excellence of our restaurants. I guess it doesn't ring well in a fancy place. Anyway, as a Kingstonian, I am used to going to a beach area where they cook up the best escovitch fish, corned with country pepper (habanero) and onions and dripping with grease but just finger licking good. That was not the case here but it was a darn righ better that I could have whipped up in my kitchen at home. I think most americans will probably enjoy it but I will wait until I am back home or at a greasy spoon in Brooklyn or one of the many Florida cities with large jamaican communities. The jerk chicken was also nothing like you would get back home but exotic enough for vacationers to the island needing a bit of nostalgia. The rice and peas was missing something. I am not sure what exactly but suspect it didn't have any coconut milk or not enough.

This place is not very big and our server, who didn't seem to know what he was talking about (how's the fish, it's yummy.  how's the short ribs, so good.  not helpful), was LOUD.  He seemed really overworked which I cannot understand because there are only like 10 tables in the whole place and there were others working...\n\nStarter - we had the Prawns and Roti.

No really.  I wish they had given me more.  The portion was smaller than I expected for the price.  The flavor was nice - and spicy - and amazing - but I still hadn't tasted anything that reminded me of the Jamaican food I had back in Chicago.

Also - while the mussels were tasty and wonderful, they were larger than normal, and neither of us cares for the larger mussels.\n\nWe were not thrilled, and for a birthday celebration, it was underwhelming, but we had a nice time (because the company was good).

Whatever the red pepper on it was super hot (I was warned it is a spicy dish and was feeling adventurous). For dinner tried the jerk chicken, with fried plantains and green beans with bacon. It was so good! Definitely going back! My son (who is 4 1/2) liked the place too, but then again he likes it when I make him cereal, lol.",1.0,0.9873052835464478

Jerk chicken will set you back 11.50, and if you want some delicious plantains they'll charge another $3. The chicken was dark meat, skin on, bone in and we got 4 thighs with our one meal. The jerk sauce was not very spicy or flavorful, and the chicken was quite greasy. The rest of the styrofoam takeout container was filled with a mixture of stewed cabbage, carrots, and broccoli on one side and rice and red beans on the other. Not much flavor there either :( In my opinion the best part were the plantains, but as I said earlier it was $3 for about 6 or 7 pieces. \nThe inside is very inviting on a cold night and the decor is eclectic. Next time I'll go for lunch and stay a while. In the meantime, I'll try David's.",0.0,0.85018390417099

If you're looking for Jamaican food, don't come here. Go to Island Grocery & restaurant [google it].  The greens were a little too tangy, the rice and peas was more like rice and beans.  They said they're known for the sauce, that too was too tangy.  The cornbread just fell apart, but that was the best part. $11 dinner, overpriced for serving.  The chef and cashier were lovely, I asked them for the best of what they had and this was it.  My taste buds prefer less soul and more Caribbean. Tried it, doubt I'll be back.",0.0,0.941517174243927

With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! \nNow, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......",0.0,0.5484902262687683

Really, I wanted to.  They are guyanese, which is one of my favorite caribbean versions; I grew up with many guyanese friends and know the flavor profile well.  \nWe stopped in for lunch - place was empty.  Perhaps a dinner might be better; I got the sense that they were still prepping for the evening, so lunch is whatever they have on hand.  They were out of curried goat.  They didn't have enough of the oxtail to make up my meal, so they gave me what they had and added some stewed chicken.  The beef patties were commercially bought ones - very disappointing.  I'd hoped they made their own here.\nOverall, flavors were average.  The sparse caribbean restaurant options in Phoenix gives this place a pass on the flavors - it's better than not having any, but nothing to write home about (at least not the lunch I had).\nThe owners are friendly, and the place is relatively clean (tables a bit sticky, however).  \nI really want to like them, so I'll give them another try - this time a dinner when I'm in the neighborhood.  Perhaps go with the more traditional roti and curry goat.... IF it's available!  Reserving judgement for now.....",1.0,0.7459096908569336
