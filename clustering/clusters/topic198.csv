I signed up with them in 2010 because some teenager was going door to door trying to sell this so called service so I felt bad for him and signed up. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. My issue was scorpions so everything was going fine for a couple months until I noticed they were not going away and and now were getting inside my house. It seemed more than before the service. My dog got bit so enough is enough and I call them to request they come on Saturdays my day off so they can spray the inside of my house. I specifically say Saturday and they agree. So a bunch of Saturdays go by and no visits. I would come home from work on Fridays to find a note and bill on my door saying sorry we missed you but we sprayed outside and here's your bill of 70 dollars. I call back and see what's going on and I get reassurance it will not happen again. What do ya know more no shows. This time I'm furious because not only are they ignoring my Saturday request they are not even spraying my house! Both neighbors on each side of me witnessed them coming to my house, putting the bill on my door, and leaving immediately after. Not one spray!! I'm beyond upset now so I call them to cancel and he tells me to basically pound sand and I can't cancel due to my ONE year contract! I only had one more 69$ payment on my contract which I refused to pay for their horrible service so I cancelled my credit card they had on file to charge me. This was 2010. It's now 2013 and I just paid 400 dollars to a collection agency because I didn't pay 69$ for a terrible service. After I cancelled the card they just sent my 69$ to collections and let it sit until it reached 400.

While sealing up my home was not an inexpensive venture, it was well worth the money we spent to keep those darned bees (and other pests) out.  Getting bees out of my walls was no small task and to have to do it twice, was really annoying.  Bees leave a pheromone so that they know where to return to and once the pheromone is there, they will come back over and over.  And since about 90% of the bees in AZ are now Africanized, it is not fun to know they are trying to co-habitate with you.  KY-KO sealed my home and they have never returned.

Nice! \n\nWe requested this about 3 weeks prior to moving in...  \n\nA few days before the big move we noticed a few live roaches... not cool. \n\nWe then hired House Doctor Exterminating to come in and spray the interior/exterior on our own dime. \n\nThe guys shows up the day we are moving in to spray the house. I was unloading boxes... didn't pay any attention to the guy as I figured his is a pro... will do the right thing and take care of the issues. Well... I was wrong.  He was in and out of the place in about 5 minutes and I can't recall if he sprayed the exterior. There were not wet spots in the house or smell from spraying the interior.  I just figured it was an empty house... easy job and he was done. \n\nFast forward two weeks...  no dead roaches even from the day he sprayed... but... there were LIVE ones.  Unreal!!!   I have a feeling the guy went in... walked around for a few minutes... as it was later in the day on a Friday... collected his $65 and called it a day. I would not recommend this service ...ever! \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow... let us talk a little about Insectek Pest Solutions...\n\nZack showed up and did an initial walk through of the house... inspecting every possible place these pests might reside. He then did the same for the exterior.  He found 3 black widow spiders and then lead me to water cutoff valve. No less than 60-80 roaches in the box with at least 100 crickets. HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL! \n\nZack put poison down the drains ... sprayed the interior of the house and really nuked the exterior. He even went as far as removing the spider webs from the exterior of the house.  Almost immediately the house inside and out looked like mass murder had taken place on the insect population which up until this point were happily living in and around the house. \n\nThis is a PROFESSIONAL service with PROFESSIONALS like Zack doing a great job.  We are very happy with the end results and we haven't seen a bug/roach/spider/cricket since he sprayed last week.  We will continue to do business with IPS.\n\nI highly recommend if you are in a need of a PROFESSIONAL pest control service... give this company a try.

Paid for 3 trips to rid us of ticks and fleas, you claim a 30day guarantee AFTER 3 paid trips, then don't return or answer calls (I guess your caller ID kicked in). \nTHats' ok, we used Bulwark who stand behind their guarantee on trip 1. FINALLY, we are getting relief from the bugs. AT $68 bucks a pop, you couldn't even get rid of the ants roaming around here.. \nYour how they say? \""get what you pay for\""",0.0,0.9744730591773988

Upon moving in my air conditioner did not work, the stove wouldn't turn on, a light bulb was out in the bathroom and I still can get the light switches to work in the bedroom and living room. In my opinion this should have all been taken care of before a new tenant moves in. If you love noise and can sleep through anything sure go ahead move in, but if not beware. The walls are paper thin, and I swear if I didn't know better if think the windows were open 24hrs. You hear everything!!! Oh and im sure you'll just love the sound of a leaf blower at 6am!!! Being on the bottom floor is the worst my upstairs neighbors must be having the Olympics going on with all the banging I hear. There is also a major bug infestation, the complex charges a monthly pest control fee which Is just a waist. I've had 2 scorpions in my kitchen, a mouse that ran across my patio while I was outside, a couple roaches out by my front door, pincher bugs consistently in my bathroom and kitchen oh and last but not least the crickets!!!! They are Everywhere!!!!! Once it gets dark those little puppies are out and about, God forbid you get to enjoy a nice evening on your patio, even a walk to the mailbox or trash they are jumping on you,  so be prepared to make a run for it and get inside fast! To have the pest control spray in your apartment you must submit a request, I've requested this 3 times, still waiting for them to come. After I called and complained about all the insects I was told \""well this is just there habitat\"" uh no, I'm sorry but my apartment is not there nesting ground. I previously lived across the street at Vista Suereno and never had any problems with bugs or noise and that's right next to a huge feild so I have no clue what management is trying to pull. I highly suggest looking at different places I'm the area and avoid this complex at all cost!",0.0,0.9991443157196044

He is highly knowledgeable in his field- he understands the detailed anatomy of the bugs and mechanisms of how different treatments work (and also why some things don't work).\n\nHe develops pest management plans for his clients based on their pests, home structures, and geographical locations.  His plans are not just about treatment, but are also inclusive of preventative and precautionary measures.\n\nHe is also knowledgeable beyond the immediate world of Arizona pests.  While we were in the process of moving from NY, he gave us tips on how to minimize risk of transferring bugs in the moving vans, and the differences in pest treatment between AZ and NY.\n\nFinally, Jason holds himself with extremely high integrity- even though we have requested his services more often than our original plan (which would give him more business), he has advised us to stay true to the plan to optimize value (cost and outcomes).\n\nWe have already recommended Jason to family, and we hope to be able to recommend him to our HOA (to win the community war on scorpions)!",1.0,0.998525083065033
