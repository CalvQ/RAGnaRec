One plus: no bees inside.  \n\nMy friend and I decided we would day drink (why not? it is the weekend) so she ordered a mimosa and I a Bellini.

It runs every day from 4-7 (I think). $3 beers, $4 well drinks, $6 house wine, $8 appetizers.\n3. The food. They have some really good salads. Tuna lettuce cups, sliders, mussels, sweet potato fries are decent.\n4. The service. Slow and prone to mistakes.\n\nOverall, it's ok if I happen to be in the area around happy hour, but with a location so far from my house, I wouldn't make a special trip.",1.0,0.9974851608276368

After looking around at the 75% empty dining room and probably looking at her strangely, she called her manager to get the OK to seat us. As someone who's worked as a restaurant server, I can tell you that any place should be thrilled to have a table like that - high tab from alcohol and quick turnover.

We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.\n\nIf you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.\n\nI started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.\n\nThe service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.\n\nNot too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Caf\u00e9. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.\n\nP.S. Who's Gabi?",1.0,0.6056492328643799

We sat on the patio where they had misters to keep us cool.  The decor outside is great, one wall has doors, windows, and a balcony to make it look more like new York. There is also a big statue of liberty replica. The server greeted us quickly and brought waters right away. She was knowledgeable on the drink and food menu.  The music on the patio was modern acoustical hits, and we found it to be very enjoyable.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine so I decided to go with the craft beer out of San Diego called Sculpin IPA. We decided to start off with calamari and the breaded mozzarella.  The apps came out very quickly. The calamari was cooked perfectly and the marinara dipping sauce was so delicious.  The mozzarella was equally perfect on a bed of marinara with fresh basil on top. For the entr\u00e9e, I ordered rigatoni bolognese which was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back soon.  FYI, they have an adjoining lounge called The Lounge which has a wonderful selection of signature mixed drinks and after dinner cocktails.

Our friend had one of the flatbread (I don't remember the exact one - my apologies) but I remember he said it was very good.\n\nOur server was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the meal and had a great sense of humor.  \n\nOverall: A\nWe will be back to enjoy that patio!",1.0,0.9991361498832704

I ate one of the three and gave the rest to my husband.  \n\nI should have known better than to order dessert, but I did it anyway--mostly because I was still hungry from not eating my tacos.

When it actually got to the table, it was completely overdone. I didn't finish it. \n\nHubby's food and margarita were solid, mine was mediocre at best, and the service was bad.

There weren't that many tables to confuse us with.\n\nOn to the food, the personal pizza is large enough for two people.  We got the Margherita and while I loved the tangy sauce and fresh basil with mozzarella,the crust was terrible.  It tasted like low sodium saltine crackers.  The Cesar salad was fantastic!\n\nFor convenience I might go back, but Queen City has way too many great places to eat to bother with just okay.",0.0,0.9864981174468994

It's in a perfect location, the decor is fantastic, and the space is ready for a giant party! There were three things I was impressed with: the patio, the bathroom, and the water feature wall. The patio is spacious and welcoming right off of Piedmont Row. The women's bathroom had two stalls, but was well decorated and lit and they have seat liners as bonus. Last, the water feature was nicely done. I can't say enough about the ambiance and decor!\n\nNow to the food. The sushi was good and comes at an elevated price than their competitors. My husband ordered the bento box and I ordered the lo mien and we both left unsatisfied. The taste was bland, unless you're a fan of oil being the main flavor that stands out. I'm not trying to be harsh, but as we were talking about our experience we both said it reminded us of frozen dinner Chinese because of the overwhelming sense of oil. I would have expected such a beautiful place to be as particular on their cuisine and entrees as the detail they put into the establishment itself. I was hoping for hints of ginger, garlic, and Asian spices, but instead it seemed to lack all of the above. In addition, like a previous reviewer, my husband left hungry. For a lunch price near $40, I wanted and expected better. Poprocks' photos definitely make the food, especially sushi, look incredible!\n\nThe server was nice and attentive.

Medium well means between medium and well-done.  It was decidedly more on the medium side of that scale, which made for a sad burger.  Having said that, the parm/garlic fries were quite good, though I thought they were also a little under-done.  We also had an appetizer basket of fried calamari, sadly it was very chewy.  The breading flavor and dipping sauces were good, but it took a lot of jaw action to get them down.  It also seemed like the wait staff was busy bustling about and not getting a lot done, full of sound and thunder but signifying nothing.

You can BYOB, and all of the servers were super nice without hovering too much.\n\nIt's located in the recently renovated Allegheny West neighborhood, and the only reason it doesn't get 5-stars is that it's a little out-of-the-way even for North Siders.",1.0,0.943688988685608

Find the food to be a little pricer for the same fare as Jason's Deli or McCalister's but always pretty fresh and good. \nLove the Chicken Noodle Soup though, my favorite!!",1.0,0.97098046541214

I cannot believe I forgot to rate this place.. I went I believe July 3rd around mid-day. It was hot as he** outside and didn't help that half the seating for serendipity is outside on the patio. Needless to say we waited to be seated about 20-25 mins or so. \nThe food was pretty good. Huge portions, for me anyways so I split the sandwich I ordered which was \""The strip steak sandwich\"". Good but I would prefer a better cut of steak... eh anyways moving along it was all good but a little overpriced. \n \nIf weather permitted would have preferred outside seating and dessert but I was too full and it was too hot to try either.. However I did come back the next day and I tried the frozen hot chocolate and the oreo frozen hot chocolate but this time I went to the walk-up, to-go window...super convenient and fast by the way.\n\nBoth were good but oreo one was better. Had a richer taste to it. The plain one was somewhat iced down.. I'm a chocolate lover so.... they also weren't as big as the ones I seen inside. not sure what difference was..
