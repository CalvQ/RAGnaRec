IMO if the price were $2-3 each way, then it would be much more reasonable and accessible to more people.\n\nThe other problem with its pricepoint is its competition.  There are plenty of free monorails across the street, which are owned/operated by the major hotel chains.   Unfortunately those free monorails only help you go through the north side of the strip, but you should nonetheless utilize them.  \n\nThe first free monorail system connects Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and Excalibur.  If you cross the street and walk past New York, New York, then you could walk to Monte Carlo.  \n\nAt Monte Carlo, then you can board the next free Monorail system.  This monorail connects you to the hotels of City Center (Aria, Mandarin Oriental, and Crystals)  and it ends at Bellagio (which is approximately 1.75 miles away from Excalibur).    Here's where you have to measure whether or not you need the monorail.  It's about a mile to walk from Bellagio to Venetian and it's about 1.3 miles to get from Bellagio to Wynn.  \n\n This monorail is a solid option if you need to get to the Wynn and Venetian from the other side of the strip.   But it's good to know your options as you're travelling around the strip so that you don't have to spend more money than you need to spend on transportation. Most of what I need is accessible via the free monorail systems.  If I choose to venture to Wynn, Circus Circus, or Venetian, I opt to park in their parking lots.

I asked the bar tender what he had on tap, he shrugged and mumbled and walked off.  On returning he listed three beers but warned he wasn't sure any of them would work. \n\nEver game for a challenge or test of wits, I asked if the bar tender wouldn't mind trying the taps and you know, seeing if beer would flow.  He duly obliged and began pulling away.  The whole apparatus barely managed to remain adhered to the bar top, wobbling and shaking. \n\nAs he had originally theorized at the start of our detente, only foam was on draft.  Mind you, he gamely persevered for some time before returning with confirmation of the bad news. For a moment I did half expect he would serve up a cold glass of froth.  One star there for sure.  Instead he offered me a bottled beer as an alternative, I was happy to accept this peace treaty - and thankfully the bottle did indeed contain beer.\n\nThis whole process took close to ten minutes, with not a single drop of happiness, enthusiasm or welcoming spirit.  I could feel every last ounce of vacationary joy pouring from my soul.  Maybe the bar tender's unique interpersonal abilities had been the ultimate demise of the beer taps, slowly eroding them into exhaustion.  My partners cocktail was made with a similar level of Vegas excitement and panache. We drank up and left quickly.\n\nThe place was deserted.  It was definitely in need of some general maintenance around the edges.  I even kinda felt unsafe in parts.\n\nWe returned later on in the evening for the reverse of our  route to catch the monorail back to the strip.  The staff were very insistent that the monorail was closed for the evening - even going as far as producing charts and documentation to  back up their claims.  We took their guidance under advisement and duly boarded the monorail (still open) and left the LVH, hoping to never return.",0.0,0.9995344877243042
