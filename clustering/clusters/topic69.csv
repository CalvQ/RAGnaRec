I was sad to see Nearby Metro close, it's waitstaff killed it, so we were happy to see this place open up nearby. \n\nThis little place was not the most \""french\"" decorated place, having been a Thai place before, but I don't care about that. I presume the owners were who were there, very nice, and attentive, but the food was lacking in what I have grown to expect in French Cuisine. Having grown up with it in the home and having traveled to France a lot, I can say it was about average, as sometimes, even in France, they have an off day in the kitchen.\n\nThe prices were about what I would expect in the area, not too terribly high, not low either, and fair if the food is great, which it was not, but I think could be, and sometimes probably is.\n\nWe ordered the fixed price menu. We both had escargot. Was not very hot, even though the plate was, but it was good. (When are garlic and butter not?). My entree was the Beef Bourguignon. Some of the meat was tender, some tough, inconsistent temperature in the serving, but the flavor was good despite the meat toughness. Potatoes were good, and as customary with French cuisine, a lot!\n\nMy wife had the Port au feu de la mer. the Fish was not too fresh tasting, and she didn't finish it. It didn't smell great either. She wanted the Vol-a-vent, but they didn't have it. \n\nThe pastries were what we were looking forward to, and they tasted a day or two old. You could taste everything in the cooler they were exposed to. What a bummer. I'm sure they were fantastic when they were fresh.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty on saturday evening, which may be an indication of why the food was not the best. If they had higher traffic, I'm sure the quality would be better. It may be the hidden location off Scottsdale Rd across from Gilligan's, not exactly the same clientele, or the run down appearance of the building, but something is keeping people away. Maybe it's the reviews. We may try it again, but perhaps for lunch.\n\nHaving read the other reviews, I hope the owners take these comments as constructive. French food is hard to do well, but it can be done with fresh ingredients, so hopefully the guy in the back with the T-shirt that says \""CHEF\"" on it learns from this.",0.0,0.994533896446228

How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all.

This place is unique and is the best place I have found to have a romantic evening hands down.  It is probably the best specialty wine shop in town too.  You walk in to a great fairly large wine shop, it's not the cheapest place but you get fantastic wines.  I mean you'll spend less at trader joe's but you get a larger more upsclale selection, typically they have french and california wines and I would guess 80% of them are between 16-50 bucks and most of the stuff you don't see everywhere else.  For an extra 10 bucks you can have the wine with your meal, so for 35 bucks you get a real good wine with dinner and for 50 to 60 you get a great wine that would probably cost you well over a hundred easy anywhere else.  \n\nThe food here is well made french bistro food, it's not \""oh my god amazing life changing\"" but I have had some things here that have been awesome and everything else has been real tasty to say the least.  They do have an apple crumb dessert that is awesome and i once had scallops with fresh pea risotto that I still remember as one of the best things I have ever tasted (seasonal).  Typically we get a bottle of wine, snack on a cheese platter or appetizer and split an entree or something for well under a 100 bucks.     \n\nOn an evening when we have nice mild weather you must go and sit on the patio overlooking the \""lake\"" and have a nice dinner.  Even when it isn't ideal they have misters or heaters or you could always sit inside that is also still real nice. \n\nThe staff has always been great.  We have been going here for years but recently we have been going more often and the waitress we typically have is very friendly and remembered us by our second time around.  \n\nSaturdays they have wine tastings also and if you register your email they send you updates about different events that they have often.\n\n5 stars not because the food is as good as is gets but the place is definitely as good as is gets.",1.0,0.999629020690918

One evening, the restaurant was completely full, but our busy and efficient waiter (Justin) still managed to take good care of our table of 4!\n\nMarche Bacchus is a must visit, at least for lunch on its gorgeous patio deck by the water in a hot Vegas day! Do ask for patio seating when making a reservation. But actually, its small, comfortable dining room is not bad either, the large windows do let you see a bit of the soothing water.

They are invariably amazed by the fact that such beautiful water ways exists in the middle of Vegas desert, and the restaurant is located in such a nice residential area by the water!\n\nBy the way, the front section of the restaurant is a medium size wine store. You can select a bottle of wine there for your table. Even after the corking fee, the wine is still a pretty good bargain!\n\n- My only disappointment with Marche Bachus is that it does NOT offer Happy Hour!

Definitely need to go back and try everything else, because I know it will be amazing.\n\nDuring dinner, they provide you with a wonderful and fresh french baguette, usually with the carrot spread thing, unless they have some seasonal special, but even then, you can always ask for the carrot thing. I don't even like carrots AT ALL but I love this carrot thing with the bread. And the bread goes sooo well with the French Onion Soup and the Shrimp Appetizer (both delicious on their own anyways.) Their wine selection was nice. Their steaks are cooked perfectly, and serviced with a nice portion of frites! And I am a carb fanatic and these frites are amazing. Don't know what it is about them... but I never waste good carbs! I wish they had real souffle, but they still have great desserts. I have tried their flourless chocolate cake, chocolate mousse (pretty big cup of mousse for one person) and their ice cream dessert trio thing *pictures posted*.\n\nThere's so many great things about this place.

I had steak roquefort, and loved the thin cut frites! If you do have an appetizer, go with the fruit and cheese platter. There were some cheeses I hadn't had before like a Belletoile.

Been to Vegas many times and have done it all, but now in my old age, I look forward to the food options.\nVisited this French restaurant about 10 years ago, and this time I took my boyfriend.\nIt was HOT!!! but managed to get a table in the shade, under the umbrellas and the mist that sprays from the railing. This is a great spot for people watching!!!\nWe had good service. The gal that sat us was very chatty. Our service, a nice young man, not overly friendly but efficient.\nI ordered what I ordered when I came many moons ago, full size order of muscles, with came with thin frites. We also ordered the warm brie with honey, and a fruit bowl, which was a carved cantaloupe filled with fruit.\nThe warm brie with honey came with roasted garlic pieces, whole hazelnuts, and 4 crustini. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of brie, but he certainly loved this! He also liked the fries. His fruit was good, and the fresh bread, mini loaf they give you, is freshly baked on the premises and is so good. \nSo if you can't make it to gay paris, this may be the closest you can come. Of course they aren't as snobby as the french can be (so I've heard). If you are a french foodie snob and have been to Paris, or France, maybe not your cup of tea, but for the rest of this, will do.

Glass prices are VERY high.\n\n- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).\n\n\nThe food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.

Looks like a piece of liver, but tastes like a piece of juicy steak. Very unique to this restaurant and pretty tasty. But I don't favor their choice of cut fries.

The roll was soft and lightly buttered toasted. Very delicate but held the lobster meat quite well.

It was comparable to those I had in Paris.\n\nFor the main course, I had salmon with terragon sauce on a bed of pureed peas, topped with arugula. This is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, very well done. It was flavorful, complex, and well-balanced. This was like Spring on a plate. I loved the fresh terragon cream sauce, it was zesty and refreshing. The salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crackly and crispy on the outside, moist and tender inside. I have tried to replicate this a couple times at home unsuccessfully. Oh well, guess I will just have to come back here! \n\nFor dessert, I had a warm pear and rhubarb cobbler a la mode. It is possibly the best non-chocolate dessert I've ever had. In classic French style, they had poached the fruit in red wine, which gave it a wonderful flavor. Also, I like my desserts very sweet, and this cobbler hit the spot.\n\nAmbience: We chose to sit in the covered/indoor patio. It is beautifully French. Very classic bistro style. They also have a very French cafe-style outdoor patio overlooking the sidewalk.

It's not your \""quaint alleyway/place that Hemingway would have hung out\"" type of authenticity, but if you're expecting that in Vegas, you are off your rocker anyway - my point is it feels about as authentic as you can get - the food, the decor, the surroundings etc.\n\nThe food is excellent and the service is very friendly (and it's crazy being in a \""European\"" place and getting quick service... it feels WRONG!).

My favorite thing about Mon Ami though was the setting/patio and the ambiance. Grab a spot on the patio and this has got to be some of the best people watching in the country. Seriously.

The breads were not up to par, the vegetables over saturated, and the meat run of the mill, with no distinction in flavor.  It's like they have a few template dishes and they remake it over and again, with varying quality. To me, the appeal of French cuisine is that a lot of attention and care is focused on the nuance of flavors and the artistry of the final product. I feel like this restaurant is more focused on giving Americans the image of French food but not the substance.

There is only one in this whole place surprisingly.  I opened the door to find two young boys dropping the deuce. Well one was on the can, the other one was watching the door. Heard of the lock you schmucks? They gave me the stare of a squirrel that is about to be runned over by the tire of a 4x4. \n\nBesides this little experience which made my trip to the buffet at the Paris hotel memorable, the food was really the catch. I can go on and on about the everyday dishes they have in pasta, rice, chicken, etc etc. But I have to highlight the roast beef at this place. It is definitely second to none. Don't forget to get a side of hot au jus to pour all over your meat before you get down and dirty. That sounded pretty dirty on its own, but the only thing that can make your experience a little better is having a couple of french models on your side. \n\nA good way to go out of this place is making a stop at the desert bakery.  If you aren't watching the calories, definitely load up on the tiramasu. It will make any dinning experience a much more pleasurable one. I chose to skip the champagne brunch, and ended up paying $17.99 for lunch. Which was fairly reasonable with the overpriced Wynn and Bellagio buffets that are out there.\n\nIf you want a good meal before you hit the road and head back to Socal, this would be an ideal stop because you won't be eating much on that 7 hour traffic jam. I will be coming back to Le Village of Paris again.",0.0,0.980505645275116

It is one of my favs. Now to the review, don't waste your money or appetite at this buffet. At best it is mediocre, but realistically it just plain sucks. I have eaten here twice, the first time by choice, the second time I was talked into it. I tried to sample a bit of everything that looked appealing. I tried probably 25-30 very small portions of what they had to offer. This is how I like to work the buffets, and if there is anything I really like I go get more. Nothing was even so-so. Nothing tasted horrid, it was all just bland, boring and immediately forgettable. Also, some of the items resembled french food and even used their names like coq au vin, etc. But in reality, the food resembled French food about as much as the Hotel really resembles Paris. Feels more like Disneyland than France by a long shot. \n\nMy advice, go to the Bellagio, Wynn or even The Buffet at the M. They are all far superior and you will have a much happier ending to your meal. Au revoir!\n\nAfter writing the previous review, I was talked into going back by my wife for breakfast. it was pretty good, nothing terrilby exciting but i was content and full afterwards. Good eggs, meats, smoked salmon (YUM), etc. My wife ordered a crepe and it was way to sweet for my pallette. I do have to admit, aesthetically, Le Village is one of the most pleasing buffets to eat in if nothing else. It feels nothing like a real French place though.",1.0,0.9884324669837952

Half the dessert weren't even French and the lady working at the dessert station threatened me because I took too many fruits, saying I can't take them out because they have security at the door.  That statement is laughable in so many ways.  First of all, I took the fruit because there were nothing to eat and way to be presumptuous!

A short Google search later Fleur by Hubert Keller was agreed upon. The fault goes to us for not doing the research well enough, but it should be shared by whomever is promoting this restaurant and placing it under the French categories. The only thing French about it were the names of the dishes and the amount of Absinthe on the menu. \n\nFor the sake of this review, let's forget that fact completely. \n\nWe were recommended the Tuna Tacos - the Tuna \""mini\"" Tacos. A complete throw away item on the menu. There was nothing special or delicate about it. Not even the tuna itself. As a matter of fact, the slice of jalapeno atop the taco completely killed my pallet. I am no stranger to spicy food, as a matter of fact I like it, but this miniature dish was extremely out of balance.\n\nOther dishes included, the Ceviche, Mac and Cheese and the most French sounding item, Vegetable Bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse turned out to be the best thing on the menu, Perfectly seasoned, very well balanced and satisfying. I would have been very happy with a giant bowl of this soup and nothing else. Who knew, right?\n\nThe Lobster Mac & Cheese had nothing new or even above average to offer. The lobster pieces were a bit chewy as well. The Ceviche has some guacamole on the bottom of the serving glass which you probably should mix in with the rest of the dish, but there was no instruction from the waiter. I know, I know. \""Shouldn't you know how to eat ceviche by now?\"" You may ask. Well, I do and I should, but when there is an idea as to how to enjoy a specific item in the chef's eye, then it is the job of the waiter to convey that. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. \n\nOverall the meal was pretty mediocre. I expected a lot more Hubert Keller amd for the money spent.\n\nWe also had a Pot de Creme dessert, which was good, but nothing to write home about aside from a gold leaf a top the cream. \n\nI suggest saving your money for a different restaurant in Vegas - there are hundreds of them!",0.0,0.9808660745620728

Keller's more formal Fleur de Lys temporarily closed this past September to make way for his first attempt at more innovative casual group dining, thus Fleur was born to accommodate the general public (and their accompanying savory palette it seems).\n\nProblem is, when a creative genius like Keller submits to \""dumbing down\"" his cuisine for popular vote who does he really hurt?

That being said, our service was just peachy. Inside Lulu is quite adorable, albeit a bit nondescript. For a French eatery I was expecting more Parisian flair, but instead Lulu is charming, quaint and comfortable. The menu is pretty diverse - everything from mussels, to calamari, to pork. They also have a great wine list with some fabulous French wines. \n\nWe had plenty of time and attention to choose a smattering of inspired dishes, I samples the: Calamari, French Onion Soup, Mimosa salad and Chocolate Bread Pudding.

The portion was plenty for two of us and it also comes with an Asian slaw. Mmmm!\n\nHubs ordered the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, which I promptly dug my spoon into. Taaaasty! Real Gruyere bubbling over flavorful onion broth and large slices of onion - absolutely spot on. I went a bit lighter on my meal - the Mimosa Salad. The salad was full of mixed greens, two toasted Brie chunks, apples, spiced walnuts and topped with a light coating of super delicious champagne vinaigrette. It's the perfect summer salad, IMO.\n\nAnd lastly, dessert. I toyed back and forth between their classic Creme Brulee and one of their feature desserts, Chocolate Bread Pudding. Sadly, this was the only disappointing part of my meal. I should have listened to our waitress when she mentioned how delicious the Creme Brulee was. The Chocolate Bread Pudding wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok.

I was happy to be finishing up with a modern French bistro menu as I rarely go out of my way to seek out good French food for day-to-day eatings. \n\nMy friend and I arrived right around 12:30 after having scoured Caeser's Palace and locating Payard waaaaay in the back by the entrance to the convention center space. Payard is a cafe that does crepes, sells macaroons and other confectioneries, and sandwiches. Also, it is a very small bistro that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nThe dining room in basically a round room set around the chefs cooking right in the middle. It is an interesting set up, but not one I was very fond of. First off, the chefs were wearing baseball caps. I don't know why this was such a turn-off to me, but it's probably because I don't expect to sit down in a French dining establishment and watch my food being made by a dude in a baseball cap. *shrug*\n\nLet's move on to the food... I started with the artichoke dip, which I thought was magnificent. It was not too soupy, nor too thick and there were actually large chunks of artichoke in it. The bread crumbs on top added a lovely compliment to the dish and the pita chips were a good balance between soft, and yet crunchy on the edges. That being said my friend ordered the Shrimp Panzanella, and it came out looking like a house salad from Chili's with two large shrimps dumped on it. Meh!\n\nSecond course, we both opted for the Sea Bass because neither of us were interested in eating chicken. Honestly I am glad it was served with mango salsa because if it had not been I would have been horribly disappointed. The sea bass was cooked very well, but the portion was small compared to the HUGE polenta cake it was placed on. I thought the polenta was strange - it almost tasted/looked like an ugly cornbread muffin from Marie Calendar's (credit to my friend for that description). \n\nLastly, dessert - absolutely delicious! Decadent, yummy, chocolatey! Oooo! I had the pont neuf a wonderfully decadent chocolate dessert. If anything I would suggest going to get the desserts here and just eating them on a table outside the cafe. Really the restaurant portion is lacking in the ambiance you would expect while eating French food, especially at the price tag they have here.\n\nSo, although it was good I would rather go somewhere else for French-faire.",0.0,0.6057301759719849

The short rib was tender but something I could have cooked at home.  Nothing very special.  And the chilled seafood tasted as if the seafood had been sitting in the freezer for a while.  Again, not all that special.\n\nOverall, the food and price was not good.\n\nThe decor did not salvage this place either.  There was no harmony to the place.  The blue and gray theme gave an air of depression and the lighting was less than perfect.  The booths' hanging lights were very classy and appropriate, but the lights outside of the booths were morose and in a dark washed cherry wood.  It clashed horribly since half the restaurant was themed modernly and the other half was Victorian/classic.  \n\nThough it was an experience, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone.",0.0,0.998798131942749

Every taste, every experience (the service, the variety of breads, the variety on the petit-fours cart, etc.) reminds us of how much we're paying for the experience, and how worthy that experience is of the cost.

The bread certainly are outstanding: wonderful taste, beautiful crumb, the crust always having appropriate texture, but TWENTY PLUS variations?\n\nDitto the variety of the petit-fours carts:  there must have been a few hundred different types!  OK, so maybe it was only about thirty or forty, but it was as bewildering as the bread cart.\n\nOh yeah, our waiter has a delightful combination of self-effacing humor (\""I'm French, but please don't hold that against me!\"") and the usual French haughtiness (but only to his colleagues, and only kiddingly!).\n\nWe were there for our twentieth anniversary dinner, so we asked for a copy of the menu.

In Montreal, it is a serious catering offence.\n\nThe same hard effort, on the redeeming side, is put in by the staff. Their cheerfulness is second to none, as is linguistic flexibility. It feels French in its presentation and attitude (positively). The snags, however, are just around the corner. \n\nThe state and ethos of the \""house\"" can be gauged by what the house puts its name on, such as house wine. At Aupres, the house wine is harsher than a mediocre convenience store-bought tipple. Cheap doesn't necessarily mean halfway to vinegar. Oh dear.\n\nBeing in a French-themed restaurant, on a French street in a French city may warrant eating some French dish. I, having had enough trendiness for one day at the Fashion Festival, was instead craving the simplicity and gastronomical coarseness of a good burger. It is also, by common sense admission, a dish almost impossible to get wrong by anyone who can cook the fancier items on the menu.\n\nDear, oh dear. Mystery will shroud the origin of the liquid under my burger bun (dressing from the salad? Burger patty juices? Who knows). Aside from the wet and oily bun bottom the burger was decent and may have earned a pass grade, were it not for its team-mate: the salad. \n\nFresh-washed greens are all the hype, but these guys were maybe a little TOO fresh. The water dripped more copious than the dressing, making the accompaniment to my abused burger an insult to the catering industry.\n\nSo what am I to make of Aupres de ma blonde? A bunch of Europhile friends, maybe students doing this for fun, ganging together to string up a pretence of quality while cutting corners, and lacking even the essential standard of care, or pride, in their delivery. The fact it's instead, from what I gather, a professionally run place makes it all the more tragic.

The rustic walls are painted with fruits and vegetables, flowers, and trees.  The corners are adorned with life like flowers and greens.  And vintage canned foods border the restaurant, while dried meats hang above the counter. \n\nthe menu, if i remember correctly is in french, however i THINK they had english menus... its been 2 years..  the waiter was kind enough to explain the specials and the menu.  He had a thick french accent and greeted us with \""Bon apr\u00e9s midi!\"" and \""Vat will you be having madame?\""\n\nwe ordered the coldcut sampler which was overflowing with prosciutto, Genoa salami, ham, roast beef, dried sausages and some other meats i cannot name.  On one corner were two little jars filled with liver pate and ham pate.  Both were equally delicious and the best i've had.  Mixed baby greens and fresh toasted baguette were nestled into the empty cracks of the platter.  mmm divine! \n\nWe also had the quiche Lorraine served with a bed of mixed baby greens, the prosciutto sandwich, tomato cream soup, and a stuffed tomato with veal (this had a fancy french name, but i didn't write it down).  it was delicious!  the tomato stuffed veal sat on top of a bed of herbed rice.  Everything was so so so good. I cant wait to visit Montreal again just so i can lunch here.  Do order wine along with your meal like the french!    \n\n I love everything about his quaint restaurant.  Its located in downtown Montreal.  The streets are narrow and lined with eroded stones.

Yes, ham and cheese alone just isn't meaty enough so the addition of bacon strips is surely welcome.\n\nWhile the menu is en francais, the staff was quite willing to explain certain dishes, especially in areas where my french is severely lacking.

So good in fact that it went to their heads and its been downhill ever since. \n\nI've eaten at some rather fantastic French restaurants in Paris, Lyon, Beaune and throughout the South of France in my life, not to mention restaurants in many of the other great cities of the world. None of them had the arrogance in their manner of service and treatment of clients that this place had. I've seen it a few times before to a lesser degree at those pretend French restaurants (the type where the waiters speak with a French accent, but actually can't speak French -- happened to me in Beverly Hills, California) where they try to bluff their way through, and on rare occasion at restaurants that had once been great and had lost it and were left simply to trade on their former reputation. \n\nI noticed it the first time we tried to eat at Bonaparte and they sent us away because the kitchen had just closed. Its not that I don't understand the kitchen being closed and thus the inability for them to serve us, but rather it's the manner in which it was done. \n\nI noticed it the second time on the amazed face of our concierge when she tried to make a dinner reservation. She was astonished at how they treated her, the concierge of one of Old Montreal's top hotels. \n\nAnd we experienced it in such full force when we arrived for dinner that we had to leave, never having ordered. It was just such an unwelcoming dismissive arrogance that comes from the restaurant staff thinking the customer is not a customer but a mark who should count himself lucky to be in their presence, totally forgetting that actually they are there to welcome, serve, and make us, the customer, feel special. \n\nThe crowning moment was when the waitress told us how we should not speak French because if we did she would then answer in French and we of course could not understand French. Quelle surprise, given that my family is French and I speak fluent French having lived and gone to school in France, and my wife speaks more than passable French. It just blew us away and was the final straw that popped the bubble of high hopes for dinner at Bonaparte. \n\nThe sad truth is the motto of this restaurant has become \""Bonaparte, where the customer is always wrong.\""",0.0,0.980975866317749

Another Montreal classic. L'express is both the most memorable and most forgettable restaurant you've ever been to. It was so memorable, that I have to write this glowing review, however, it was so forgettable that I could never remember the name, could never figure out how to search for it, or how to even describe in a somewhat unique way. And yet it is just that - unique. Oddly enough.\n\nThe whole reason I went to Montreal was to experience Europe for half the money and take in a Habs game. I took in the Habs game on a Saturday, and had Sunday night to have my romantic poor-man's Europe experience. L'express delivered.\n\nFrom the outside, this place is completely non-descript and somewhat forgettable. You could walk by it on Rue St. Denis and choose a thousand other restaurants over it in pretty quick fashion. But, if you come in from the ridiculous winter cold, you get a totally wonderful experience. L'express is, in my opinion, the ultimate French bistro. Not that I've ever been to France, but if I had to paint a picture of what the ultimate French bistro in France would and should look, sound, and feel like, L'express would be it. Checkered floors, a long, classic bar area, and a narrow table-clothed dining area. It's fine-dining, but rough enough that you picture some poor, disaffected artists eating frites in the corner. We sat at the bar, and the bartender spoke absolutely NO english. Perfect. \n\nWe ordered a small glass of the house red, which was $5.00 CAD. Awesome. I think the house red was still a French red. Don't see that much anymore. This being a French bistro, I went with the hangar steak frites, so I could try and compare it on even terms with the more faux-french american bistro's I'm used to. Perfect. The hangar steak was wonderfully cooked in the simplest of preparations, the frites were undeniably wonderful, and the whole meal was delivered as efficiently as possible with as much charm as possible from the french-speaking bartender. I also remember eating some of those cornichons in the picture, though I'm fuzzy on how that came about. Maybe it comes with their totally awesome french table bread?\n\nOverall, L'express is fast, affordable, romantic, poetic, and delicious.

The highlight of actually going to L'express was walking through the multicolored convention center to catch the metro. Located in what the Montrealers call the \""Latin Quarter\"" - really I didn't see any Latins, but many other fine little eateries. The place was not as lively as I would have expected it to be on Saturday night at 10pm. It was all maroon inside and had the feel of a pretentious diner. The service was OK, not impressive, but at least not snooty. \n\nI asked the waiter for a half bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and he brought me out and opened up a bottle of Merlot. We ordered the hanger steak and frites and the Lobster Risotto. We were for-warned by a local that the French bistros do not provide the quantity for the price they will charge and I just didn't get the hype after I got and tasted my food. I have to add though, that the Risotto had a generous quantity of lobster meat in it. I was afraid it would be aborrio rice with essence of Lobster - like a bisque. But it pleasantly surprised me with the meat. Although, at this time, Lobster is unfortunately very cheap to buy this season due to overfishing - hence the generous portion of lobster meat. \n\nBecause we didn't get enough food, we had enough room for desert and the Creme de Caramel l'orange was a true mouthful of chewy orange skin bits. The coffee  that we ordered to accompany it was over roasted because it had a burnt taste.  Maybe  that's what they liked? Eh, I'll just  go to Tim Hortons.  But the cup it came in was so heavy I had to hold it up with two hands each time to drink it.

A goat cheese salad with endives followed and it was ok but nothing special, then a steak tartare, here we had a miss.  For me the texture (seriously ground to a mash), was so unappealing, and the flavors were too mild, barely anything other than capers, at 24$ with a choice of fries or mashed, this was the big let down.  \nOn the other hand the wines are great, they get all private imports which is ideal, we samples a gigondas 2008, costing 58$ that was very appreciated.\n\nI have in the past been here for breakfast, which is rather limited but always good, it is not for those looking for bang for you buck or to fill up, but it is a very pleasant atmosphere.\n\nThey have really long hours and are often opened until 1-2am so if your looking for some quality noche, after hours this is a great alternative to crap food usually available at this time of night.",1.0,0.990044355392456

First of all let's be clear about the price tag that is associated with this French cuisine \""gastronomie\"" experience. You'd easily end up paying around $90-100 per person (aperitif, entree, dessert, coffee, tips and tax). \n\nThe decor is good in a rustic way. There's no printed menu, all the available items are written on a blackboard which covers more than half the wall adjacent to the counter. The waitress who served us, very cheerfully and patiently, explained in detail all the ingredients in the menu items we chose and how they were cooked and would be served. Although the item list is pretty limited, they have chicken, mutton, beef, fish and veggie well covered. I chose escalope de veau as my main dish with coquille St. Jacques as the entree. Both these items were very delicious. The veal escalope was served with green beans and roasted tomatoes with a chef's speciality creamy sauce. Although the portions are medium sized (you won't expect big portions in a French restaurant anyway) they compensate it with giving you a lot of bread and butter that you can have with your entree or even with your main course. \n\nWe ordered Margot 99 (I don't remember exactly) to go with our order and it was sublime. I chose mousse au chocolat as dessert and an espresso to go with it. Needless to say that the dessert was excellent as well. \n\nThe only thing which would stop me from going back to this restaurant is that it's very pricey. Apart from that it's a very good place to eat with excellent decor and ambiance. Oh and if you'd like to have a digestif, they serve cognac/grand marnier as well.

The cuisine is not French, but French/African Creole and is one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had.  I was visiting Montreal for the weekend, and by sheer luck I discovered this GEM.  I live in New York City, and consider myself quite the foodie.  I have a policy in NYC to not repeat restaurants, since there are so many and so many that I still have to discover.  If Le Piton was in NYC, I would be in this restaurant every other week...that's how incredibly good it was.\n\nTo start, I loved the ambiance.  The music was good, audible but not too loud.  Lit perfectly, and the decor made me feel like I was visiting an island paradise.\n\nNext, the owner himself, Jean Pierre, was our host and waiter for the evening.  He's a very pleasant and amicable man, who, even though I spoke not the slightest bit of French, was ever so gracious from the very beginning.  He spoke very good english, important for a tourist Gringo like myself.\n\nImportant to mention...the restaurant is BYOB.  This is very good for keeping the cost down.  Try to bring a nice white to complement the spices.  There is a convenience store across the street, but it's wine selection was limited at best, so if you can, plan ahead and bring a nicer bottle you have lying around.   A good sweet white or a Nouveau or a nice Lambrusco would really go well witht he subtle spices in the food. \n\nThe food...amazing.  Menu is prix fixe and very reasonably priced.  I started off with a salad that was unique, light, but sweet and delicious.  I then moved onto the octopus.  This was the most unique and saporific octopus I'd ever had.  Was not rubbery AT ALL, a first for me.  I highly, HIGHLY recommend trying it (Jean Pierre confessed later that it's his favorite too).  Not tried was the shark, though this is the other specialty of the house, so I trust that it must be good.\n\nJean Pierre has been meticulous in putting together his restaurant, and everything fits together beautifully.  The menu is one of the most amazingly crafted menus I've ever experienced.  Jean Pierre sticks to the mantra of doing a few things, but doing them better than anyone else.  If you are in Montreal visiting...go to this restaurant.  If you live in Montreal...go to this restaurant often.  You will not be disappointed.",1.0,0.9994712471961976

They serve their entrees with an assortment of cooked vegetables ranging from stuffed tomatos, some kind of fried zucchini, a breaded mash potato ball, asparagus, and a colorful pink edible flower to garnish.

For that reason alone, we normally just go to the Original Pancake House.  On the drive there, we were reminded of Cafe Monte, a place we had always driven by but never stopped.  We turned into the parking lot and discovered -- what's this? -- they open at some crazy-early hour on Sundays.  We walked in and I was immediately excited, as I was reminded of the French cafe at Epcot, as well as an awesome coffee shop in Chicago.  The restaurant was immaculate and decorated so perfectly, giving it that French feel.  The accompanying, relaxing French music only added to the mood.  We were seated right away.  We walked past the display case of pastries, past the grand counter/bar, and into the dining room full of dark wood accents, large mirrors, and vintage images of Paris.  Already I was glad we had picked Cafe Monte over OPH.  \n\nWe were greeted promptly by our server and ordered coffee.  The coffee was brought out in small stylish cups and I was worried -- being the big coffee drinker I am -- that it would be a challenge to get refills.  I'm happy to report that not once did our server (or other servers or manager) allow me to see the bottom of my smallish cup.  \n\nI went with the Parisian omelette on the menu, which was ham and bacon with your choice of cheese.  Naturally, I chose brie.  We were in a French restaurant, right?  It was full of ingredients and very flavorful.  The brie really accented it.  Served with it was a thick round hashbrown patty, a small bowl of fresh fruit, two slices of -- ta da! -- toasted French bread, and whipped butter and freshly made (?) jam.\n\nEverything was absolutely perfect about our experience that I can't say enough about it.  The pricing was slightly more than you might normally pay for brunch, but it was totally worth it.  The atmosphere, the service, and the food were everything that I needed for an awesome brunch experience, so I'd gladly pay the couple extra dollars.  Thanks, Cafe Monte!

The lights were dim and we were served by a friendly waiter.\n\nThe menu isn't too extensive, but the items on the menu aren't the common ones you'll find everywhere. I opted for the duck confit and tried some of the beef tartare. \n\nJust a note - you can get a french onion soup and a glass of house wine if you check in on Foursquare ONLY on Mondays - Thursdays from 5pm - 10pm. They budged a little for us. We had 3 check-ins but they were able to give us 1 special.\n\nThe french onion soup was delicious. Under a thick layer of baked cheese, you'll find plenty of onions, bread and a flavorful, spiced onion soup. This soup is perfect for a chilly day/night.\n\nThe duck confit was good. I wouldn't say it's too out of the ordinary. It's not my first time having duck and the way it was cooked was just like any other duck I would have. You'll find that the sliced potatoes on the side are much more interesting. They weren't too tough or soft - I enjoyed them more than the main itself. \n\nThe beef tartare that I tried was good. It wasn't too spicy but the portion was huge. If I wanted beef tartare, I would opt for the appetizer instead. \n\nOverall, dinner wasn't too expensive and we all came out full. However, I would only come here once because there ought to be better choices around the area.",1.0,0.9980701804161072

We weren't sure that we followed correct protocol - picking out our pastries then taking them up to the counter to eat in, but be certain that the people who run this place are both accommodating and honest. The guy at the counter told us (well, told Chris M in French) that we were welcome to take out our brunch or eat in, and he said that it's rather more expensive to eat in. Still, because the place was so pleasant and ambient we chose to eat in anyway.\n\nIt's so relaxed that I could quite easily envisage myself bringing a book to a place like this and settling in for the morning... afternoon... heck, as long as they'll have me. I went for my favourite maple pecan plait as soon as I clocked it and it didn't disappoint. It's a hard thing to get wrong (even supermarkets do these well) but when you need a knife and fork towards the end of it because the things so fresh and gooey, you know you've landed on your feet. The Francophile himself went for a traditional breakfast of croissant, bread and hot chocolate which looked equally awesome.\n\nNot only is this a great morning place but it's actually a French restaurant too, bursting with salads, sandwiches and main meals, and it's a shop to boot... all of which I'll be exploring if I get a chance to go back. So that's great food, lovely service, awesome atmosphere... Can it do anything wrong? Non, Franc-ly.",1.0,0.9990231990814208

To say that I love Paris 66 would be an understatement. I love and adore Paris 66.  It is by far my most favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. They've gone out of their way to make it charming and not seem cheesy. I don't know if you've noticed, but it's really easy to go wrong with Paris decor. Instead of puking Paris all over the walls, they have subtle Parisians tones. It's exactly what you'd expect a small caf\u00e9 to be like in Paris.\n\nEarlier this year my husband and I walked in after seeing their sign on the sidewalk. A french restaurant in Pittsburgh? I just had to see if they had macarons. I LOVE macarons, and I have been on the search for the perfect macaron on this side of the pond. And I don't mean those silly coconut cookies or whoopie pie like creations people try to call macarons. No, I want THE french macaron! \n\nWell, Paris 66 has them. Their macarons are exactly what a maracon is supposed to be: mana from Heaven. They have the perfect egg shell crust that is crunchy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, their feet are perfectly formed, and the flavors are strong. They are delightful.  After our initial intro to their macarons, we had to go back. \n\nWe've been there for lunch (you can't go wrong with the croque-monsieur) and most recently we went there for my birthday in August. This time we went with my sister, brother-in-law, and my young nephew (he's just under and year and half).  We had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Renaud, was from France, which made the experience all the better (if you speak French a lot of the staff speaks it natively and will kindly speak to you in French or English).  He was very attentive to our table, and even paid attention to our little nephew. \n\nThe meal was delicious. My sister and I both ordered the boeuf bourguignon;  the beef was so tender that it simply melted in your mouth. The carrots were done perfectly, they weren't mushy, but just right.  I can't remember what the others ordered, but I do know that they loved what they had. \n\nAfter our dinner Renaud brought out the birthday cake we had brought with us (unfortunately, they don't have cakes available, however we were allowed to bring in our own).  He had lit candles on it and sang happy birthday. He even included some blown up balloons to add the festivities of the table.  It was the perfect dinner. \nI don't think it's possible to order a bad thing on their menu, and the service is always spectacular. \n\nDo yourself a favor, go for a meal (or heck, even just a macaron) at Paris 66, you won't regret it.

I was sort of hoping for lunch, but I thought, well, we are here, so why not.\n\nWith brunch came mimosas. Unlimited mimosas. But, that was just the beginning. First came the Samon Fume -- smoked salmon with capers, chopped eggs, creme fraiche and toast. I've never had smoked salmon, but after that course, I'm hooked!  Then came the Crepes de Crabe -- crab stuffed crepes with a decadent tarragon sauce. And, after eating every morsel and thinking how my stomach was able to devour everything on each plate, I found more room in my seemingly bottomless stomach for the final course -- Beignets Au Nutella.  Puffy golden gifts from God with a devilish chocolate/hazelnut dipping sauce.  It was like I was eating each course like it was like the last one I would ever have. But, damn, if I had a choice, these dishes may just be the ones I'd want to eat before my final goodbye.  \n\nMy only complaints, and they are very minor, is the price for the three courses was a bit high for me ($29), and I wish they served lunch on the weekends.  Despite that, I had a great meal and it was a nice treat for me and my friend.  Plus, it gives me an excuse to go back another time for lunch and dinner.\n\nIf I knew how to speak French, I'd end with a great French saying.

True to its French roots, the stucco exterior is full of greenery and flowers and resembles a cottage straight out of a french children's book. It's just as dainty inside. When you first walk in, it's similar to walking into an enchanted cottage with a bar on the left and intimate dining on the right. The patio is hidden and covered with plants. While petite, it really is the perfect size for the concept. \n\nThe food is tres bon. I've tried their two specialties: the salmon braconne and the burger Maison. My goal is to try everything on the menu but for now I think I've gotten le creme of the crop in the cuisine department! Normally more of a sandwich girl myself, I heard that the salmon salad was pretty spectacular so I had to give it a go. The reviews don't lie my friends. It's delicious. It's buttery, delectable, refreshing and literally melts in your mouth. The poached salmon is cooked to perfection and I wish I had the entire salad and not just half! However, the burger was just as spectacular as I hoped as well. With the brioche bun and gooey cheese, it also melted in your mouth and the bread was as soft as can be. Next on my list is to try the Croque Monsieur because if it's anything like the food I've already tried, then I know my taste buds are in for a treat! \n\nAll in all, Petite Maison lends for an adorable experience and I think this would be a good restaurant to go with friends, your Mom or even on a date. Or all of the above! The staff is incredibly friendly and I wish they would place petite maisons all over the valley! We need more french dining like this.",1.0,0.9990779161453248

By that I mean they are arrogant.  Very nice food but apparently having a reservation and being a loyal diner who recommends the place means nothing to this snobbish group.

One round table was given to a 6 while we were 5 and the other close table was set for 4 when it could have been made for a 5 just as the table offered next to the entrance of the patio entrance and main walkway in was.  They could have given us the other table and switched the 4 for  5 and visa to accommodate us but they flat out refused. A location next to their fireplace was requested days in advance and as usual it was a cold AZ night in January.  When our displeasure was indicated to them they basically said \""tough luck\"".  When I asked for the owner/chef to say something to before we left for another restaurant they acted like he was not available.  When i noticed him behind the curtain I waved to him asking to speak to him.  He did come out and when I noted our disappointment he immediately verbally attacked me for in his eyes pointing at him when I clearly waved at him to indicate I wanted to speak to him.  He is too pompous for words and this small restaurant will stay small and eventually sink into failure as many in Yelp have indicated for poor and pompous service.

I have been craving french food for weeks now. So happy when i got a gift certificate from the awesome restaurant.com last month to try this place out.\nThe place was pretty empty around 1/130ish when we got there. The waiters were especially nice and helpful to my parents who aren't french food experts. They brought us out a bread basket that was just mostly toast and an alright baguette. (also with butter and jam) for being a somewhat fancy place (and could be romantic on a warmer evening by the waters of lake las vegas) i was hoping for mini croissants along with other mini fresh french breads. let down.\nI ordered the veggie crepe. I love savory crepes and already was craving it for days now after looking up the menu. spinach and artichokes in a crepe with melted cheese. mouth watering with all that yums in my head. It arrived to me and I was so excited to dig in...until i actually did. Food should make you want to eat more. crave it. mouth water for it. This \""savory\"" crepe did none of the above. It was lacking some spice. or maybe it just needed less cheese. There was just something about it that left me...not wanting more. My mother agreed who shared with me.\nMy dad had the fish and chips and said it was pretty bland. The pomme frites that came with it were hardly impressive.\nNow onto my boyfriends food...he had the smoked salmon eggs benedict. Now this I was impressed with. His had me wanting more. Had that certain quality that you crave in food. i'm lucky he shared some with me. It had a little spice left in my mouth after every bite that had me wanted to come back.\nI'm giving it two stars for the nice and helpful service and my boyfriends eggs benedict. maybe it even could go for 2.5 I just wish this california/french bistro left me wanting more. I will post pictures of the food tomorrow.",0.0,0.8720409274101257

I've passed it many times and this past Saturday I went for Brunch with my Girlfriend and her parents. The service was very friendly and helpful with breaking down the menu for those not familiar with French food. Though despite being a fancy looking place our bread basket came out with mainly toast and jam which kind of took away from the experience being that I expected Croissants and more/a better baguette. It's rare for me to critique the starter and apologize if I come off pretentious but I was not impressed. My girlfriend had the Spinach & Artichoke Crepe which looks great. Despite ordering it easy on the fondue both My Girlfriend and her mom felt it was still too cheesy and not leaving you desired to have more. My Girlfriends father ordered with Fish & Chips which should be an easy mark to hit but after trying it we all agreed it was very bland. I however lucked out with my meal when I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. The eggs were done perfect and served on a nice durable English Muffin. Usually places put too much or too little Hollandaise sauce, but not only did they put the right amount but the sauce it self was very well balanced. It wasn't too sweet at all yet full of flavor which I find rare. Of course the Smoked Salmon only helped being that it was a nicely prepared portion leaving a light spice and an amazing taste in my mouth (The seasoned potatoes served with it weren't bad either). Unfortunately it seems the dished are a bit hit and miss but I give it 3 stars for the Service, Location, and the strength of my dish in particular.",1.0,0.9903811812400818

With the exception of getting a small glass for my friend's seven up, we were not people hard to serve.  That is not an excuse to be borderline neglected. I refer to minor things like checking back often enough to see water glasses are filled often enough for there to be ice in it to keep it cool.  Or just for there to be water, especially if the person is having water as their only drink with the meal.   I expect that.  Watching your server outside the front door when the water needs to be filled?  What to do when you are ready to leave and your server is having a long conversation across the room with another employee.  Finally I had to make a decision whether to go get him myself or ask the young man who was helping the table next to us to go get him?  Last but not least, how difficult is it to remember to bring a bag to put  take out containers in when you have just been asked?  I gave up on that one.  When I left I just walked past my server carrying them out.  Guess he didn't notice?\n\nThe question might be asked why were these minor things annoying enough for me to say more about the service than the food itself.  My dining companion didn't want to go to for French food but did it for me.  She had no complaints about the food-thought it was excellent.  She thought the ambiance of the restaurant was nice.  However,  the service embarrassing.  This is a major sore spot for me when it happens.  I make no apologies for it.     \n\nI might tell you one other thing.  I have GERD.  If you don't know what that is, I will tell you I have to be careful about what I eat or I can get major indigestion, etc.   I knew I'd pay for what I ate and i did.

Very good value.\n\nMy salmon starter was quite divine, and whilst very small it really is a tasting to whet your appetite for the main. And the main of risotto was a very, very generous portion.

Not exactly warm but very polite. \n\nWe all ordered the Haggis Tower with Neeps and Tatties with a Whiskey sauce for our starter which was delicious. \n\nI asked the server if they would consider doing that as a main course if one ordered it.

The chicken had crispy skin, the sauce was flavoursome and fortunately not greasy as cassoulets I have had before. The others ordered the grilled Cod and the pasta which I was told was good too. \n\nWe had desserts that we shared between us. The Champagne sorbet, Toffee crepe and profiteroles.

But we can always end up understanding each other and getting the business done. I give them cash and in return I get awesome delicious food.\n\nI think this review might be unfair as I only order one thing off the menu. That is the ridiculously delicious Banh Mi sandwich. Their Banh Mi deviates from the traditional Bahn Mi. But it doesn't matter. Usually Banh Mis are meat (pork, chicken, sausage, whatever) served with pickled carrots and daikon, cukes, cilantro, chili peppers, some kind of pat\u00e9 with mayo in a French baguette. This is a throwback to French colonial days. I always try to get mine mild, so out go the chilli sauce and or peppers. And I love that hoagie, with a passion. I tell everyone to try it. In fact I order them to get one of these brilliant sammies.\n\nHowever at Caravelle they have a different take on it. They don't have the tasty pat\u00e9 and the pickled veggies are replaced with a slaw of carrots and cabbage. Normally the pickled daikon rocks my world. But here, the simpler Banh Mi is still one serious delicious treat, inexpensive and always fresh. Even though I rapidly munch down the real foot long sub, I never feel bloated like one does eating a hefty sandwich, I feel rather refreshed. So I love it for both it amazing taste and the no-side effects. I dunno what it is about Banh Mis but I could easily eat them daily and never get bored and always find a new taste or texture to them. \n\nCheap quality eats with a coke for about 7$, now that's a lunch I can live with considering the rest of the restaurants never let me go without taking at least 20$ from my wallet.

When asked if the truffle pastry could be cut in half, serve half at the bakery, half to take home, we were met with such resistance and astonishment that we just ended up giving in and having it served in its entirety, only to throw away the uneaten half.  Honestly, it's enough for 3 servings, and would be better enjoyed in small doses because it is too rich for such a large portion.\n\nOur second choice was a puff pastry filled with a custard, again supersized, but not as rich, therefore more manageable to the palate in one sitting.  It was quite delicious, the puff pastry fluffy and buttery, and the custard was creamy and perfectly sweet without being overbearing.\n\nThe cappucinos, were weak in flavor, if frothy.  It almost tasted as if made of a regular roast coffee bean.  No self respecting coffee lover would call this a cappucino.\n\nThe actual location is large, but feels cold and sterile.  Bright blue formica tables and chairs more fitting for a hospital commissary and enough super bright flourescent lighting to perform microsurgery on an ant doesn't add to the ambiance, which is non-existent.  The layout is confusing and unwelcoming.\n\nThere's a lot of potential, both for the space and the menu, but it is a far cry from the warm, burnished familiarity of a neighborhood bistro.  In the land of faux finishes, they could certainly do with some mood lighting, cafe curtains, and bakery smells or the scent of broiled cheese on a Croque Monsieur (a French bistro staple not on the menu), not the ding of a microwave.  Even a surly French waiter would be welcome in place of the two perfectly coiffed and manicured suburban housewives looking down their noses when asked to cut what basically was a piece of chocolate cake in half.\n\nSo my excitement lasted all of 5 minutes after walking in, alas I am not destined to have a convenient patisserie at my disposal.

At $19 I figured I was getting myself into something somewhat decent, but there's a reason I don't usually order a burger at a French restaurant: they're not good.\n\nThe restaurant is located at the Cosmopolitan hotel on the third floor with a bunch of other fancy overpriced restaurants. Comme Ca has a really great outdoor patio with an amazing view of the strip, otherwise the interior is pretty dark and plain. It's definitely not as 'cool' as Holstein's or even Jaleo.\n\nThere's really no burger menu to speak of, as there is just one burger on the menu: the appropriately named 'Comme Ca Burger' with certified angus beef, cheddar, dressing and pomme frites. It sounded simple enough, but I was in for a surprise once it arrived. The cheddar was quite melted which made me happy, but the 'dressing' is what confuses me; I think it refers to the large heap of something that resembled a cole slaw on top. Not what I was expecting but ok. Something in this assembly was extremely salty, I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the slaw, I was kind of in a state of disappointed awe that I had just ordered a bad $19 burger while my friends were eating what looked like much better meals. The meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, but didn't have much flavor to it. The bun was stiff and dry, and not that great either. Overall it was just a big messy pile of stuff that didn't hold up well as it got towards the end.\n\nThe fries were equally bad, overly fried and crunchy. Is that how pomme frites are supposed to be compared with regular fries? Either way they didn't make me happy, and I only ate a few.\n\nAll of this, combined with the already stated price of $19(!!) made for not a great burger meal. I will also mention that my three friends who each ate different things were all quite disappointed with their meals, so at least I wasn't the only one. I have some friends that have come in to Comme Ca and left happy, but none of us can claim such a thing. If you're looking for a decent burger while in the Cosmo, Holstein's is clearly the better choice, but if you're into French food maybe you can take the challenge and find something you like here.",0.0,0.9988021850585938

This location is definitely spacier and more open than the one in Point Breeze.  The service is great.  Many of the service staff from Point Brugge work at Park Bruges.  The no-reservations rule still apply here and the wait is the same.  The style of the menu is similar but of course with different plates.  The food was good, but I would still prefer the cuisine at the older location. The frites are 10x better at Point Brugge than here.  Here, they are thinner cut fries and not as crunchy.  I had the Red Wine Braised Shortribs for dinner and though  it's good, but I didn't want to lick my plate clean like I normally do when I visit Point Brugge.  The moules are the same here.  One thing I really didn't like were the desserts, especially the souffle.  When you think chocolate souffle, you think of a fluffy and light pastry in a white ramekin hot from the oven seconds from being baked.  I anticipated getting this and digging my spoon into it and watching the pastry collapse into itself revealing the yummy goodness inside.  Well... It is a crime that here, they call their dessert a souffle.  It was more like a flourless chocolate cake.  There's nothing wrong with that, just don't call it something that it clearly isn't!  Disappointing!\n\nThe ambiance here is also different. Point Brugge is certainly livelier and more cozy, but I guess this place is more for bigger groups or families or if you prefer to be more than an arm's length from your fellow patrons.  All in all, a decent place to eat, but if I had to pick between the two Belgian restaurants in town, this wouldn't be it.  However, I would definitely return here.",0.0,0.9302362203598022

The menu is on the wall and changes frequently from the looks of it.\n\nStaff was very attentive and helpful as our French is non existent. It was explained that they really try to source from Quebec first, Canada second, and lastly elsewhere. Our evening started off with drinks I had a local beer and my wife a local cidre.  Our waiter explained the specials and the feast commenced. We started off with the stuffed oyster, Lebanese lamb tartare, and Asian style greens. The oyster arrived first and what an oyster, the size of my hand stuffed with onions, herbs, cheese, and more. Very rich and filling as we finished that tartare and greens arrived. The tartare was prepared excellently with middle eastern spice and a tzatziki style sauce. The greens were amazing garlic, chilies, soy sauce, and dry-salted cured pork. Being pleased with everything so far we pressed on wanting to savor every bite our last night out in Montreal. Me moved on to the fried rabbit and clam special. The rabbit was tender and tasty broken down into quarters and lightly fried. The clams came with an amazing broth garlic, chilis, and herbs. Skipping dessert was not an option having seen them go by to other diners as we ate. A seasonal rhubarb parfait was the perfect way to end my meal, my wife couldn't resist the pot de creme, a rich smooth chocolate custard. C'est fini!",1.0,0.9918593764305116

The only French restaurant I have ever eaten in Edinburgh is La Garrigue.  The chef, waitress & manager were all French which I thought was a good sign.  I was expecting the same quality but unfortunately I was wrong.  The managers and waitress were all very polite and well mannered.  It is unfortunate that the food quality was just mediocre and average.  I mistakenly chose a 3 course set meal for dinner as opposed to lunch but the manager was very kind and talked to the kitchen staff and they were willing to prepare the dinner set for me.  I am unsure if the limited time to get ready the dinner food before dinner actually affected the quality of the food.  If that was the case then they should have said no to me ordering the dinner during lunch.  I had Baked scallops served \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale as the starter.  The scallops were fresh and delicately prepared but the roasted peppers that came with it tasted like they were from the jars.  I had Duck legs with ratatouille, roast garlic and tapenade sauce as the main.  The duck was a bit tough for a leg dark meat and seems like they were deep fried from as opposed to properly prepared French style.  The worst was actually the desert.  The Creme Brulee tasted like a thick custard and not a proper Creme Brulee.  I judge French food by their Creme Brulee but this not Creme Brulee so it felt like I actually have nothing French to judge in this restaurant.

First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.  \n\nWhat's nice about Mimi's Cafe:\n1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down).\n2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast.\n3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.  \n4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.\n\nThere WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not).",1.0,0.9986103773117064

The fake sky on the ceiling sort of implies that the Eiffel Tower is higher than the stratosphere (the actual stratosphere, not the tower).....yeah. The fake trees and plants inside are quite hilarious. \nFood: The Le Village Buffet is one of the best in town.

If I have to drain the weasel when I'm in here (and I strangely seem to be in this place a lot) I actually will walk all the way to the bridge in the back and use it in Bally's. No barriers between the urinals, and the appearance of the stalls make me feel uncomfortable. They're just weird. Also, the shopping area is also very French, and not in the Chanel sense.

I've been to this establishment three times, once for lunch and twice for dinner.  \n\nLet me talk about dinner. Lunch was great, but I don't remember anything about it :(  Dinner, my friends, is well worth it.  For one, I'm addicted to their \""c'est si bon\"" martini (it's a bit overpriced...but it's absolutely delicious...what is it?  A watermelon martini, and it's fan-freaking-tastic!).  Now we get to why I adore dinner so much--it's that wondrous hot baguette that comes with a side of butter and slightly picked julienned carrots.  Oooh...I'm drooling. I could make a meal out of this and in fact, I did once.   Okay, I may be weird, but i'm obsessed with it.  \n\nI'm a sucker for their escargot.   How can I not be?  The sauce is scrumptious!  Butter, garlic, parsley AND I have this hot baguette!  W-O-W.  As for the entrees, I've had steak on both occassions--new york strip the first time and the ribeye special they had that night.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much...it's not going to be the same cute you get from 555 east or Mortons, but it's delicious nonetheless.  And the pomme frites? Spectacular!  The cut is just great.  \n\nI've also been equally happy with their desserts. I'm a sucker for creme brulee, and I'll even happily enjoy the most mediocre of creme brulees.  I would have to say that my favorite desserts are the crepes and the tarte tartin (rustic apple tart) a la mode. Divine!  I have a sweet tooth.  \n\nAs far as customer service goes, I have absolutely complaints--with the exception of feeling a bit embarassed by the incredulous looks I get from devouring a loaf of bread and carrots.",1.0,0.9996399879455566

Only problem is, after sitting and staring at the menu for probably a good half hour, nobody could decide what sounded good. We couldn't even figure out what we wanted to drink! It's not that the menu didn't have enough variety or options to meet our needs, it was just sort of...uninspiring.\n\nAfter finally placing our order, I ended up with a bowl of the French Onion Soup and the special of the day, braised short ribs served over mashed potatoes with a spicy sauce. The soup was pretty good, served the traditional way in a crock with baguette slices and an overdose of delicious cheese. It was a little sweet for my taste and serve sort of lukewarm (which I think may have been intentional since it was 115 degrees outside...but I still think I would have preferred it hot).

We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise.

The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \n\nTo make matters \""worse,\"" we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert.

The hostess immediately sat us at a very corner of the restaurant with a window view to the outdoor garden patio. My back was against the wall sitting on a very long wooden church bench, a pew. Within 30 minutes, the place was packed and the tables were filled up.\n\nI was hungry and saving my appetite all day. I proceeded to order a chicken liver salad that came with a nice warm poached egg on top. I also ordered a glass of risling. The moment I took my first bite, my palet were opening up to total heaven!!! It made sitting on the church pew feel  more heavenly. By far, one of the best salad I had in Charlotte! (True meaning of Yum Salad. It is a famous salad in South East Asia). If I can lick the juice of the plate, I would. Luckily for my date, the waitress brought the spoon for me to scrap every juice of the dressing left on my plate!! YUM!!! By this time, the French owner came over and introduce himself as Fabrice! Very nice guy.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the duck breast with artichoke, cooked as the chef would recommend. The duck breast was plumb and juicy, slightly more cooked than what I was used to, but it was still delish! The cream sauce was slightly heavy for me as I took my time sipping on my merlot chatting with my conservative attorney date who was not too familiar with French dining. He ordered overcooked steak and french fries!

We were looking for French food but less expensive than what your generic google search would spit out. I really gotta give them 5 stars as my experience was impeccable.\n\nThe food was excellent at every point along the way. Several different kinds of locally baked breads and a wide wine selection, along with our waiter who recommended a great wine choice, which made way for several different appetizers for each person's taste. I got the escargots which were far better than ones I had tried previously, made with a simple garlic and butter sauce. Their basic salad with other prix fixe meals was also lovely, and the cheese plate was great as well.\n\nChoosing my actual entree was not as simple. Had I asked more questions, perhaps I would have chosen differently, but one of the specials was locally-sourced crab legs. That I got to crack myself. And wear a bib. In public.\n\nAnyway, goes without saying that it was flawless. The crab was in a classic butter sauce and it matched the other veggies on the dish perfectly. Highly recommended from myself, although they may not have it when not in season.\n\nLastly, as a visitor and English-speaker, being in Montreal is always a little tricky. I speak some French, however I was with my brother and his girlfriend who were not as versed in the menu and style of dining. As rude as some people were in some parts of Quebec, the waitstaff and bartenders at Chez Leveque were very accomodating and really wanted to give us the best experience possible and bridge the language gap.\n\nI really can't say enough great things!

The staff even had an accent to go with the great smelling pastries!\n\nI decided to order a florentine croque monsieur. It was dense and savory, definitely belying its size. Don't be so quick to judge how small it is. Le croque monsieur - which came with a plate of sliced baguette and butter - were very filling.

Something that I found surprising is the lack of English in their menus even if most of the clients are tourists who come to visit the Fine Arts Museum, they have their menu in French printed on the disposable place mats but no English in sight. I was sitting next to a big table with visitors from India and they were having a hard time with the menus. The staff  was kind of aloof and reluctant to help them. Printing a menu in English on the other side of the place mat would have helped a lot. I was there with a friend, we ordered coffee and some pastries and the food was served without a single paper napkin, the waiter came brought the food and disappeared.
