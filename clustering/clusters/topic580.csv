Seeing the venue from the street view just made me think that this place might be leaning towards the sketchy side... which threw me off because the lineup of events is quite stellar!\n\nFirst thing - the entrance and parking us behind the venue...which is an entirely different world.\n\nBunkhouse is like a discovery zone! Upon entry, there is an old piano that you can play. TONS of spaced out outdoor seating... looks like chairs and tables collected from yard sales and thrift shops but it's super cool! There is also a music tree to your left. The music tree is fantastic at night! There are about a dozen headphones hanging from lights on that tree... each one featuring a different genre of music/sound. We listened to each of them and found some favorites. While outside you can also order food and drinks at their outdoor bar. We learned that you don't have to pay cover to play outside... there are speakers surrounding the outdoor space so that you can hear what's going on inside. But if there is an event, the cover will be charged when you go to enter the actual building. \n\nInside the building is a stage (on the smaller side) seemingly set for more intimate feeling shows. There's a full service bar, tables that line the walls and a nice sized area in the middle to dance and/or crowd around the stage. The bar has seating surrounding it - kind of a U shape. They have a nice selection of beer, wish they had more draft selections, but thats the beer snob in me. Inside there were flyers saying that every night (didn't give a specific time) the draft beers are $3. :) \n\nOur first trip to Bunkhouse was for a local hip hop artist showcase but we will be returning for a DJ event in November. I will be sure to update my review then!\n\nAs of now though, I am a fan of Bunkhouse. Can't wait to try what their kitchen has to offer!",1.0,0.7892792224884033

Its just the kind of dirty, loud, and eclectic place you'd love to find when trying to avoid the usual trappings of Las Vegas.  Most nights at the Double Down Saloon have ended with a great story to tell, be it the bands or the patrons involved.  \nSpeaking of the bands, they are pretty well hit or miss, but they are always free to watch and usually extend into the long hours of the early morning. Some of the best bands that I've seen in Vegas have been at the Double Down, and so have some of the worst.  The television sets play a continuous cacophony of classic live punk videos, b-grade mid-20th century film footage, and the lowest budget soft core porn these eyes have ever seen.  They have some of the worst pool tables in town and the place is covered in unknown punk band's stickers and some very well done graffiti, yet it is all part of the Double Down's amazing allure.

They have a fantastic beer selection and again 16 year old bushmills.  Yeah!!!  The best selling point though is their house band.  OH MY GOD!!  One of the best irish bands I've ever heard.

By obscure I don't mean fashionably off the wall, like NME would want you to be. Avalanche are firm supporters of the Scottish music scene, right down to its core. There is a great representation of local, unsigned artists in this store, and you can pick up a number of interesting CDs from local artists. \n\nAs Lynsey said, it's a bit disappointing to see their punk section shrink considerably. But musical eras come and go in waves, so I'm sure punk will have its day again soon in some other form. For now, Avalanche is a great place to pick up some off kilter, interesting folk and alternative indie music CDs. \n\nMore recently, their place in the Scottish music scene has led to them hosting the occasional gig in their shop space.

That's cool I guess but I really didn't feel right standing, not that I care what anyone thinks about me but it just seemed odd.\n\nOlder people, yuppies and just a weird restaurant vibe. I also overheard one of the bartenders complaining about how there's no music scene in Phoenix. I've heard that for years and it pisses me off. While this place may be right off a freeway and not really too inconvenient, it sure does look inconvenient on a map. I would think their location alienates roughly 2/3 of the valley. Poor choice for a music venue location in my opinion.\n\nBartenders were nice but like I said the place just has a weird vibe. I don't know that being in a strip mall makes it any less odd either.\n\nAlmost forgot, the set timing was horrible.
