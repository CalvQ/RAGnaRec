There were maybe a few tiny crumbles of goat cheese which most likely amounted to less than an ounce of cheese.  They charged us $1.00 for the sprinkle of cheese they gave us; it was not that big of a deal, but I would have liked enough of it to taste it on the pizza.  The fact that it was burnt didn't help.  No one checked on us until we were done eating. It's not as if they were really busy.

Some were amazing and this included the calamari that was cooked to perfection with just the right crispy batter.  In fact, since there were several dishes to sample during the first course, I was surprised when I went back to it after it had cooled and the calamari coating was still delicious.  I also loved a special pasta they had with fresh corn, the flavors were fabulous.  However there were a few dishes I was disappointed in, like the Roman salad that was rather bland, with very little dressing or flavor.\nMy biggest disappointment was a result of something the server did.  I was having a difficult time deciding on my main course and was torn between the mixed grill and one of the steaks.  I knew I wanted to try the aged beef they are known for, but decided on the mixed grill after the server listed its components as containing a 4oz skirt steak.  I love skirt steak and could then also try their bison sausage and giant shrimp.  When the dish was set down in front of me, I immediately asked about the steak as I could tell it was not skirt (generally a flat cut of beef).  The server was fetched and explained that no, it was actually hanger steak, but said he called it skirt because it is from the same part of the cow.  Funny because hanger steak is one of the few cuts I don't care for.  It is considered a good steak by many, it is just not my preference.  And it really isn't the same thing at all.  So after only one bite, my $62 mixed grill was a disappointment.  The shrimp was delicious, but the sweetbreads and bison sausage were just fare.  I had also ordered a $5 side of horseradish sabayon and was surprised it had so little flavor.  The sabayon texture was great, but I think there was a strong possibility they forgot the horseradish because all I tasted was the egg and salt.\nThe desserts were also a mix - the sorbet had great texture and a special they had with cannolis was delicious, however their ricotta and berry trifle was a little bland with very few berries.\nMy wine was fabulous, but my last experience was the server handing me someone else's check by accident.

Our server was quick, attentive, and very knowledgeable.   Our food came one item after the other with little to no waiting.

I say unnecessary because with so much other food, we could have skipped the salad, but it was refreshing after the fried calamari.  Plus, it was more than just lettuce greens.  It contained some pricey items like kalamata olives, hearts of palm, and pine nuts so you definitely got your money's worth for only $2.80 to add to an entree.  \n\nLastly was the entree.  I ordered the tuna steak -- rare -- with a chimichurri sauce (you can pick one of four sauces/flavors for your grilled fish).  It was so full of flavor.  We had made good choices all around.

Almost like a white people BBQ sauce, you could taste the brown sugar. Now the mini duck sandwiches have potential. However, again it was so white it just wasn't right. Some spice would be nice!

The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! \n\nI ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.\n\nNot sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!",0.0,0.8400641679763794

The calamari fritti is one of the best I've ever eaten in Madison, and I am always picky about my squid.\n* BIG portions, we could not finish everything in one meal, although my husband and I were normally not light eaters.\n* reasonable price, especially since the restaurant is located on State St. and the portions are big.  However, I wish they can serve smaller portions of foods for less price.\n* good bread and relaxing italian ambience\n*a very friendly and good customer service (we got there at 9:30pm and left after the restaurant closed. When I told the waiter I wanted my osso buco to go and I would like some extra sauce if they have any left, the waiter asked the kitchen staff to make more sauce. I was soo impressed with this service).",1.0,0.9994951486587524

This place just seats just 20 people, so prepare for a long wait if you do not show up at an off time (like 4PM on a weekday).  Its a great place for couples, but a trio or more might have a struggle finding a place to sit together.  Everyone is really social at the Oyster Bar, which added to my experience.

Let me preface this by noting that I have worked in Washington, DC for the last seven months and have dined at some wonderful eateries.  Cafe Provence can easily hold it's own with the best of the DC restaurants.  Tonight, we took my in-laws to dinner at CP.  I had the Dover Sole--superb.  My wife had the Dover Sole--same dish and just as superb.  My MIL had the Potato Encrusted Salmon and my FIL had the Veal Oscar.  The Salmon looked exquisite and tasted even better.  The Veal Oscar was delicious and freshly prepared since we heard them pounding the veal in the kitchen.  We did start the meal with the Calamari and it is some of the best Calamari we have ever eaten.  Dessert for the in-laws was Creme Brulee--unique and terrific.  Amy and I split the Spumoni.  If you have never had this ice cream delicacy, it is not to be missed.  We all left feeling very satisfied and gastronomically serene.  There is just no other restaurant in Anthem like CP.
